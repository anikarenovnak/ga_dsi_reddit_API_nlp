### Classification Of Reddit Posts: Project Overview

The objective of this project is to utilize the API of reddit.com to pull data from two different subreddits and build a model that will predict which subreddit a given post comes from. The two subreddits used for this project are r/depression and r/anxiety. 

The best model with the best predictive power on out of sample data was determined to be Multinomial Naive Bayes. Beyond quantitative evaluation of the model, the model was also evaluated qualitatively based on its most important features. The purpose of this qualitative assessment was to establish some grounds for interpreting the models ability to classify in accordance to conventional definitions of depression disorder and anxiety disorder.

1,"I’ve been diagnosed with anxiety and depression for many years now, but I never really thought I had much anxiety. But I’m only now realising that so many things that I thought of as normal (like me hating texting or calling others and getting really panicky about it) is actually my anxiety, not just me being socially awkward. 

How I never realised this before, I’ll never know lmao",1
2,"Lately I've been watching Star Trek Discovery... It's only got 2 seasons but Ive rewatches both at least a dozen times all the way through... It's like my routine... While I'm at woke or when I wake up or at night I can't help but rewatch the same episodes I've already seen before....

There's something soothing about watching something familiar over and over again.

Does anyone else do this? ",1
3,"My timid personality isn't just reflected outside the house but also here on reddit! My worst fear when writing essays is that I won't have time finishing it all because of how slow I type my sentences. I always fear that my grammar and use of vocabulary will be judged negatively, which is why I tend to spend a lot of time thinking of what I should say, only to lose confidence at the end and delete everything.

I have\* spent 2 minutes writing this short paragraph. I have no regrets, but does anyone else suffer from this? It's come to the point that it's affecting my studies, and I'm deathly sick of this!",1

5,"A stigma that I’ve noticed in the mental health community... so many people are happy to talk about it and embrace your differences, but oh no.. don’t have a panic attack in front of them, don’t seek re-assurance from today’s anxious thoughts and jitters. 

This is something that needs changing. It is more than ok for someone with diabetes to be comforted even when they deliberately let their blood sugar go too low, and then be looked after by people around them. (This was one of my co-workers) but when I struggled with low mood I was told ‘we all have days like that’ ... ‘don’t let customers see you unhappy or uncomfortable’ 

This is an issue with how subjective everyday anxiety and a chronic mental health issue is, if someone does not understand the effort it takes to behave normally they will default to judging you based on how they deal with it. 

Of course it’s not all bad, I’m lucky to have family and a handful of friends that have seen me go though treatments and recovery so know the full spectrum of my issues and do not judge or baby me. 

I felt like sharing this little rant to hear your thoughts on if you’ve been accepted or told to ‘hide’ symptoms from the public to spare THEIR discomfort... like your doing it on purpose. ",1

9,"I hope this helps whoever's reading this. For the past 2 years I've been suffering from really bad anxiety in social situations and just worrying in general. It has resulted in shitty sleep, loss of appetite and libido, hair thinning, and pretty bad depression. Also a big thing was it got so bad that I would feel nauseous and would start gagging.

I started going to counseling in October and meditated a bit. I didn't really feel like it was doing much at first. But then I started to notice that after I would have a really shitty anxious day, I wouldn't feel like absolute shit for the next week. I would actually be able to mentally recover after only like 3 days, and would be able to put myself through this hell again. I then started group counseling as recommended by my counselor, and saw how I wasn't alone. We all talked to each other and it made me a bit more comfortable talking to people. Then an injury I had for a long time finally healed and I started working out again. After a couple months of that, mixed with exposure exercises instructed to me by my counselor, as well as mandatory exposure such as group presentations etc, I can say now that I don't feel nauseous all the time anymore. I still feel shitty in social situations (especially in the beginning) but it has slowly started to calm down to a more manageable level where I can stay in the situation. Everyday feels like I'm getting stronger and stronger and I hope this story gives you guys hope to not give up!",1

14,"I walked home from school this afternoon in the autumn air, listening to the Barefoot in the Park soundtrack, and I just felt so absolutely happy. Life suddenly seems so romantic, so worth persevering for. I’m slowly becoming a new person and I can feel it.

My anxiety has lessened recently – only one exam left and I’ve had just one panic attack all week. I’m actually okay for once. I’m starting to handle myself.

And I know how naive it must sound, but I am so very excited for the years to come. For university, where I want to double major in linguistics and Latin or literature and take as many courses that I can about everything that I love. I hope that I can rent a tiny studio and fill it with cheer and art supplies and candles and plants. For once, the future feels warm and close.

I picked up my coloured pencils again today and started drawing. It feels so lovely to let myself do that.

The world is becoming rosier. I’m just hoping that it stays this way, at least for a little while.

15,"Hey! I don’t have anxiety, but this ex-colleague of mines does. They started in January, and probation period lasts for 6 months but since then they had been taking a lot of days off and was always late. She was such a sweet girl, has a degree and is hopefully going to university for a second degree! But because of the absences, like she never had a full week straight in work, she was dismissed. It was done pretty poorly and our manager was pissed at the agency who employed the girl. They basically sent her back to our office, BY HERSELF, and she was crying and pretty shook up about it all.

Anyways, she has added me on facebook. Do you guys have any tips on how I can talk to her???? ",1

19,"What's up guys, got a question for all of you something I have been grappling with...

For the longest time I have forced myself into interacting with others and socializing because I have sucked at it but I am pretty good at it now and can make conversation pretty easily and have always felt so nervous around others and afraid and I still get quite afraid but I am not so afraid as to put on a act anymore.

&amp;#x200B;

I just feel like I don't have that much innate energy within me. I can't care enough anymore to try and put myself out there and try and force out questions on how people were doing or how their weeks going. Like I don't get how people have the desire to go hang out with others and be perfectly content and be energetic? I want friends I really do but at the same time what I would naturally do is just be by myself all the time. I thought giving less fucks about what people think would make me happier but really it's just made me boring and annoyed.

&amp;#x200B;

Is this what depression feels like? What am I doing wrong? I really just dont get it anymore. I have the easiest life ever so why am I so drained of energy? Why is my outlook on life so negative? 

&amp;#x200B;

Do you guys feel like every interaction you have with another human being is forced? I have come to the realization that the past 4 years no interaction with anybody has been genuine. It's all about what I get out of it or what it means for others. I don't actually care about my friends or the people around me I met I only care about how I look and I am just losing the energy to try and interact with people anymore.

Does anybody else feel this way? How do I bring back that energy? Why do I get so caught up in my feelings?",1

I still managed to start the year optimistic, thinking this would be my year, that I’d find a job in a few months.  Things took a turn this week when my dad was admitted to the hospital for a cardiac surgery. Two days later I got the news that my dog (who was my entire world and the biggest support I’ve ever had dealing with anxiety/depression) had died. That was yesterday. 

How do I even process all of this? I’m completely paralysed, haven’t left the house in 2 days. I need my dog back. I need my support system intact to get me through this transitional phase in my life. My dog was the best help I’ve ever gotten :(",1

I used to have social anxiety ( at such levels I' couldn't even buy myself something to eat and can't eat in front of people ) but somehow by forcing myself ( with 0 drugs I'm proud of it ) into situations I overcomed my social anxiety. But lately I started to develope some sort of gad ( generalized anxiety disorder ) towards lots of thing. There is that one girl I really find cute but I feel almost physical pain to do something about it. I think my bad experiences with exes gave me relationship anxiety. Whenever I think about a relationship I see only pain and misery at its end. So I avoid relationships all together.

Literally nowhere. I’m just so broken hearted about it. The only person I have and can rely on in myself, everyone else always cancels or completely ghosts me when theres previously arranged plans. 

Growing up, I’ve always wondered if I had this aura around me, you know? If I have this weird vibe to me or some shit. Its like theres this huge sign hovering above me telling people to stay the fuck away. I’m starting to accept that I’ll never have any friends, and Ill be alone forever.

I've gotten to the point where its constant anxiety when I leave my dorm, socializing is hard and can only talk to a few people. I am doing better today but the week has just been one long anxiety attack, from the time I've left my room to when I fall aslesp.

I feel like I'm being stupid, I'm just overreacting and being an idiot. I want to go home but I'm just worried. That's all I have been this week is worried and scared. God I hate anxiety. Should I set up an appointment? Or just deal with it?",1
31,"First time post here. I have been dealing with some anxiety lately, mostly related to fearing that I have some sort of terminal disease (I don't). Google makes it worse. Every time I feel an ache or pain, I google it, which just exacerbates it with me thinking I have something catastrophic. I am a pretty healthy person- 33 years old, good shape, no history or any major health issues, same with my parents and grandparents.

&amp;#x200B;

It all started with my stomach in late Jan/early Feb. Acid reflux, pain, etc. I convinced myself I had stomach cancer. Ended up getting an endoscopy, which showed everything was fine. Stomach issues went away a few days later (surprise). All blood work has been normal, as well as BP. Lately I have been dealing with tension headaches (which I have convinced myself at times is a brain tumor, even though I have no other symptoms of one). They start in the afternoon, and usually affect my temples, forehead near nose, and top of head (sometimes back). One thing I have realized in that I am clenching my jaw a lot during the day, and am unknowingly tensing my throat and chest at times. All of this I think is contributing to the tension headaches. My question here is what are some things I can do during the day to prevent the jaw clenching and cheat/throat tensing?

P.S.- According to google every symptom anyone has ever had means you probably have MS, lol.

34,"Hi there, new to this sub.

I've been dealing with something these past few days and maybe someone here has had it or something similar and can offer advice on how to overcome it.

It's very hard to explain as its happening in my own mind so nobody would know exactly what's going on but I'm gonna do the best I can 

Basically during the day I sometimes get this thought that tells me I cant be happy. It could be at a low moment or a moment when I'm actually in fact happy but its just a thought ""you cant be happy"" and it makes me unhappy instantly. So weird. Now generally I am able to distract the thought right away and I could brush it off, I've known about this for a few years now and it's never been that big of an issue.

 But during one of these thoughts 3 days ago, I wasn't able to brush off this thought, tried to argue with it and it weighed on my mind, I kept trying to deny and suppress the thought and it only got worse and it felt like it got more powerful.

 Now, I've tried a few different techniques that have worked temporarily like telling the thought it has no power over my mind and that I just have to believe I have dominance over my mind and I can be happy and these often work for about 5 minutes to 30 minutes but then I get the thought again and it takes control. I try to distract myself by thinking of other things about my life but the thought always comes up and sometimes even stays and I cant distract myself from it even when thinking other things. I've tried ignoring it altogether when it comes up but that usually just feels worse because then it starts actually working and controlling my mind. Lately, the thought has been coming back again and again nonstop. 

When I keep trying to think positive, smile or drown it out with different thoughts, it gets exhausting and I start to feel trapped in my mind, like everything around me is harder to process.

Music, Youtube videos, Netflix, reading and meditation helps me a lot with this during my down time and it only really happens during the day. In the morning and at night I'm pretty good.

 But I cant have this all the time during the day when I'm out and about. When I'm walking from place to place and stuck with nothing but my own thoughts is when it's the worst. Also I dont want to just distract myself, I'd rather conquer this altogether rather than keep suppressing it

Advice on how to deal with this? It's only been going on for a few days and I definitely wanna confront it right now before it gets any worse. I'm also open to doing therapy if its needed

Just started therapy again...this time around she sees some low level depression too. Never taken meds and they scare me to death (therapist brought it up) but going on like this is not tenable..l

Some moments I just don't think I can handle my life...but I will soldier on and fake it until I feel better.

I was laid off from a job i very much enjoyed in early January (great way to start the year, eh?) And finally, today was offered a job at a pretty big company.

I. Am. Terrified. 

The position isn't entirely new territory, it's about the same field as my previous job.

I'm worried for the strain of going from not working, to 40 hours a week.  I'm worried about keeping my OB appointments, counseling appointments, my husband's appointments. I'm worried that I won't be able to physically or mentally handle the job, and that they'll fire me when i tell them that I'm pregnant, or if I'm placed on restrictions later.

WHEN and HOW do I tell them? What if the job IS too much? What if I mess up? Or what if i do tell them about my pregnancy and they find ""another"" reason to let me go?

45,"Hi. My name is Dimitris. I am 28 years old living in cold Canada. 

I was a happy teenager when I lived back in Greece. Thats when it happened. My mom suddenly passed away when I was 15. I was in shock. My world crumbled and I went into hardcore anxiety. I developed panic attacks and major health anxiety due to my mom's passing. For years and years I would be scared that everything that I would do, somehow, they would cause my death. Either by stroke, heart attack, sleep apnea, you name it - I had it. 

I moved to Canada when I was 24. I still had the panic attacks and health anxiety for all those years. Nothing helped. I didn't want meds so I just let it ruin my life. I was a husk inside my own body. My girlfriend helped me by being there when i had major panic attacks but that would not solve the problem. 

Thats when I decided it was about time for me to take control of what I lost all those years. I found a personal trainer that was very sympathetic with my problem and we worked slowly for months and months to force my brain to desensitize my normal body feelings. After a whole year it was done. 

Now we are here. 2019. I am still alive. I am still going strong. Sometimes I have panic attacks and health anxiety but its not part of my lifestyle anymore. I can run. I can go to the gym. I can go hiking. I can go to the club.  I can finally be free.

I don't need a lot of money (I'm a college student), just something to give me a little spending cash. 

I thought about doing UberEats, but the subreddit and reviews makes it sound like a terrible gig where people constantly scam you, and you're spending all your gas driving around for 5 dollar deliveries. That sounds like it sucks.

I've thought about freelance writing. I love writing as a hobby, and I'm an English major, so I like to think I'm pretty good at it. A few of my friends have done it to make a quick buck, but every resource I read is incredibly complicated and is marketed toward people who want freelance writing to be a career. It's all very, very confusing.

48,"I’m in college and getting to the stage where I wanna start earning money. I live with my boyfriend who pays for the house and food and I want to start contributing to that. I also owe various people money 

Money has always been a huge anxiety for me for some reason. Its a more apparent problem now though and I feel ready to get a job so i figured, it made sense to get a job right ?

The only problem is, every time I get to shop I want to apply to, I get to anxious and don’t even make it through the door, I just turn around and walk away.

I don’t get it, i have a strong drive to get a job and earn money but then at the same time, I’m to scared to do  the steps needed to get a job. It so frustrating. 

Anyone else get this or have advice ? ",1
49,"I really need advice. My job just asked me to take on a major role change that would involve becoming a decision maker and having tons more responsibility. There is no way to do a good job at this role - you are constantly having to decide between multiple bad choices, putting out fires, making decisions with imperfect information. It also involves going to meetings all the time with no solo work, working tons of overtime, basically managing a large team. I don't want to climb the career ladder and I'm already suffering from anxiety in my current role. I just have no desire to take this on and increase my anxiety 10 fold. But I also have anxiety about saying no to people. That they will judge me if I say it's for my mental health. Does anyone have any experience handling a situation like this?",1
50,"I began a career job after working student/retail jobs my whole life. I lucked into a career opportunity and since then, my anxiety has devoured me whole and I haven’t smiled since I began employment. My past jobs involved a lot of socializing and moving around, but now I have my own separate office and the workplace has less people to talk to and they are all too busy to have casual conversations. The position has a long list of tasks to do and I don’t know how to complete many of them due to experience and I don’t have anyone to ask for help.

It has been affecting my sleep and my mood is always low. I only have an appetite when I’m outside of work, and even then it is lower then normal. 

I feel so alone and overwhelmed. Focusing on breathing and ignoring the clock hasn’t worked. What should I do?",1

I don’t even know what to say, for one. In my opinion, I’m a great social worker but when it comes to advocating for my clients I always try to look at it from both perspectives and ask myself: Is this truly advocacy, or should the client be choosing their battles better? The client wants me to ask the counselor for a run-down of what happened last session. I know it is what the client wants, but I also don’t want to “rock the boat” for any parties (myself included).

All I know is that any time a new situation happens, something new and not done everyday. I freak out. For example, they wanted me to do something new at my job, something I'd never done before. So at first I was fine. You know whatever, I'll figure it out. But after a while I started getting really hot, wondering what if I screw something up, feeling really sick. So I left early. So this kind of thing happens every now and then. I'll go for a long period of time without having any kind of problems and then something will come up, like going to the bank or going to the dmv, and I freak out.

There is no relief, there is no end in sight, and I am so tired and pissed off and scared of the future and scared that this feeling will never go away. I'm projecting my anger onto other people and starting to hate my sister, my mom, my boyfriend just for not understanding what I'm feeling or for not even asking. Sometimes I feel depressed but lately I'm feeling straight up pissed off. Like why can't I just live my life and enjoy it even a little bit? Why must every second of every God damn minute of every day be filled with senseless, baseless, intrusive, nagging anxiety? Why the hell am I like this? I would love it for someone to just say, You're trying. You're doing good. You're going to be alright. Some acknowledgment. But of course I feel like I don't even deserve that, because what exactly have I done? Ignored the bad thoughts in my head? Well woop de fucking doo?

Well yesterday we were talking about sex toys and she asked me if a penis felt the same way inside as a dildo. I told her it was relatively the same and I asked her why she wanted to know, and she told me she was just curious since she has never had sex with a man before. I then asked her if she has been thinking about it because she wanted to have sex with a man, and she said no, she was just curious to ask how it felt since she has never had that experience. She said she wonders a lot of things like how it feels to get shot or stabbed or to do drugs, but she never actually wants to do any of those things.

69,"I have no life skills. I have horrible anxiety. I’ve never worked a job, no one wants to hire me and I’m terrified of getting myself into something I can’t handle. My life has barely even started and I already don’t see a good future for myself. Literally the only reason I haven’t just killed my self yet is because I don’t want to make my mom sad and the thought of having to face the wrath of god for all the shitty things I’ve done in my life doesn’t seem too pleasant either. 

I have no skills and I’m fairly certain I’m too unintelligent and low functioning to make it through college or any kind of training. I’m absolutely horrible at math, or just working with numbers in general, so being a cashier is hardly an option for me because if I fuck up and someone yells at me I might just end up killing myself right then and there. I can’t handle conflict. 

I feel like the few things I enjoy in this life would make unrealistic careers. I like painting but let’s be honest, how many people aspire to be artists but go on to live piss poor lives because no one goes a shit about their art? I like nature but I can’t think of any nature related jobs I could possibly get. I’d love to just do charity work for a living but that kind of thing doesn’t exist. Charity and volunteer work take up money and time that I don’t even have. 

I always felt like if something were to happen to my mom I’d just kill myself. I don’t really want to die, but I think maybe telling myself that it’s my backup plan if I can’t improve my life in any way is significantly easier to handle than worrying about another option. Idk why I’m even posting this. I just wish something would change. I don’t know why everything is so overwhelming and I don’t know why I’m so afraid of normal shit people do everyday and don’t even think twice about. 

People always want to urge everyone to go therapist shopping and to hop on the long list of medications, which is fine for other people, but I’ve already gone down that road. I’ve had multiple therapists and I have never found therapy helpful other than the fact that is ruled it out as being helpful. The medications made me feel sick and had weird side effects. Plus I can’t just sit around for another few years waiting to get better. I can’t continue being such a financial burden on my family. I can’t live with the shame and the guilt. ",1
70,"I have to write some papers for my current studies regarding the future of labor and new technologies. The paper wants proposals to ""guarantee full employment""

However, it's not writing the paper that's stressing me out. It's the topic.

71,"Ever since I started using reddit a few days ago I've found that talking to people online in an anonymous way is a great way for me to talk about my problems (I have depression, a lot of anxiety, have trouble socializing, have lack of confidence, suicidal thoughts, and the list goes on and on) without fearing what the other person thinks of me.

I've found that even though anonymity is seen as something bad since people who don't know anything about you can say horrific things about you without ever showing their faces, it can also help people with social anxiety talk to others without feeling as anxious or worried about what the other may say or think about you.

The reason why I'm writing this post is so that anyone who is going through hard times, or just wants someone to talk to, can talk to me in an anonymous fashion by sending me a private message through this app/site.

74,"Want to hear your thoughts.

So, you have anxiety/depression, but that doesn't make you a problem. I think for most people having A/D is totally reasonable, for example, if you go out into a social situation and there's a few dicks there that make you feel uncomfortable, or you have issues with your safety, or something happens that scares you, of course you're then going to be worried about going out into social situations and you're going to feel anxious about it... As would anyone in that situation!

Same with depression. If you're X age, still haven't achieved what you want, still haven't got a relationship you want, still hate your job, can't buy a house etc then OF COURSE you're going to feel depressed about your situation and that's natural because you feel dowm about your self perceived lack of accomplishment. This is NORMAL.

I don't think the way to fix these issues is to go on meds and practice a tonne of self care to make yourself feel better short term. Surely, you need to gently expose yourself to your triggers, slowly, until they become less triggering over time, etc.

For depression, you need to surely try and change your situation. I don't think it's unreasonable for someome who (by their measure) has a shit life, to then be down about it? So surely the best thing is to take small steps to change certain bits and keep going, etc.

I just feel like meds and short term self care (candle bath, gratitude lists) will just make you feel better chemically, but not fix the cause of your actual issues which TOTALLY JUSTIFY why you feel anxious/down.

Does that make sense? Idk. Just trying to say most A/D cases are totally fucking justified and the way out is to take small steps towards what scares you. I've had people close to me just take meds and have baths and never make an effort to fix the circumstances that gave them their JUSTIFIED feelings. Downward spiral much?

Interested to hear what you think",1

When people DO reach out, I'm afraid they think that I was just fishing for compliments or trying to get attention and they're only giving me kind words to get me to shut up. 


I also have a friend that I really like and enjoy talking to; he's like my #1 person and he's been really busy lately with school work so he never has much time to talk.

81,"^Possible ^TW: ^self-harm ^talk

I've struggled with anxiety most of my life. As a kid I was always called a ""worry wart"", I had bad anxiety and depression in high school, and then I got worse in university. 

Now, somehow, I survived university. I had big ups and downs. I had some successes and made some serious mistakes. But ultimately I survived.

After university, I worked part time and really focused on getting better. And I did. I'd had a *lot* of anxiety around education, particularly assignments. And some of that anxiety would turn into self-harm when I felt overwhelmed with it. But once I stopped studying I was able to untangle from those triggers and function okay in my job.

It's been about 3 years since I last studied. I'm now working full-time. But recently I decided to do a grad certificate related to my job, but only one unit at a time (you know, for that work-life balance, making smart choices for my mental health...)

Well, my first assignment is due Monday. It's been a huge challenge. My teacher called it a ""trial by fire"" for those of us who are cross-discpline students. 

But today I had my first ""failure"" for the course. (Which I know isn't really a failure, but it felt like it.) Where basically I missed the deadline to get feedback on about 1/2 the assignment (ran out of time to submit a draft).

And I know it's completely irrational. But as the deadline got closer and closer (and later at night) it felt like the world was closing in on me. I was instantly irritable. Every sound made me want to smash my head into a wall. My head was full of unclear thoughts. It felt like glass was in my ears. Every sound was magnified and screaming at me. I started hurting myself: pinching, scratching, biting, punching myself. I just wanted anything to make it stop.

I feel like such garbage. I just want to scream.

I can't believe that one assignment is all that's between me and self-harm. Can it really be that fucking small??

I haven't even failed the assignment! What the fuck is wrong with me? I get a little bit overtired and miss out on something small, and suddenly I'm 3 years ago and I feel like I'm actually going insane??

I did eventually find an incompatible activity for self-harm to help snap myself out of it. (It's kinda dumb, but plank exercises worked for me? Makes me tired and I have to tense and relax between each set.)

But I'm so annoyed and upset at myself. I should be better than this. Why does everything fall apart over something so not worth falling apart over? Ahhhh!!!",1
82,"Hello, I’m a longtime lurker, first-time poster. 

I’m in my last couple months of school, and I’ve been suffering pretty badly with my anxiety so I was recently put on medication to help me get to the end and then my plan is I’m going to come off them and do CBT over the summer. 

I try not to take the meds unless I need to, though I do end up using them most days. 

I’ve been taking them daily at the moment as this week I’ve been doing my first real exam spread over the week (because it’s so long) and I really struggle to stay calm in exams without them. 

Today, I slept in, and forgot to take one.

Because I’m in sixth form I get free periods, so I slept in my car through the first two hours of the day (my frees) and forgot to take it again. 

So I went to my exam and realised I hadn’t taken it because I started shaking. They take about an hour to kick in so taking one then would have been pointless anyway. So I did my best and got that part of the exam done, without getting too stressed. To be honest, I’m not sure how I managed to pull it off, but I did and I’m pretty proud.

But that wasn’t even the spectacle of today.

I had work tonight, and an hour before my shift started, I was leaving school, when I tried to turn my car on and it wouldn’t. Basically, I’d been listening to music without the car running and had the AC running, and killed the battery. 

Luckily, I’d had the window down so my boyfriend could talk to his friend in the car next to us, and he heard my car sputtering when I tried to turn it on and stayed to help. 

My boyfriend and his friend ended up pushing my car up and down the car park twice with me trying to bump-start it (which didn’t work) and then a teacher came out who luckily had cables and after about six attempts, we managed to jump-start it. 

I didn’t even get a single tear-prick, god knows how. I usually can’t deal with anything if it’s going to make me late for work. I have a huge fear of disappointing people and usually even the prospect of it sends me spiralling into a panic attack. But somehow, I managed to stay chill, and it actually really helped us all be productive and work as a team to fix it. I doubt if I’d lost it I would have gotten to work on time. 

So we managed to get it going again, and I was able to get to work *early*, med-free, and without a single tear. 

I’m gobsmacked, and so so happy. I’m riding the high from today, something I haven’t felt in years. To a lot of people out there, yeah, sitting an exam and having your car battery die is stressful, but for my anxious self without her meds it usually would have been the death of me. So today has been an enormous achievement for me, and I couldn’t have done it without all the help from my friends. 

I just needed to share my little achievement with you guys, so thanks so much for reading!",1
83,"I've always had wanderlust, and a desire to see things and do things out of the ordinary. Recently, things have been extremely tough for me and I'm thinking there's only a few ways out of this mess. Maybe some insight is what I need. I'll try to keep this short and sweet.

Details about my city - It is in shambles. Hypocrites, narcissists and criminals have made this city home, and I want to get away from it. And I'm not just saying that because I want to run; it really is a degenerate's playground. The environment and the people that live here are incredibly toxic. Even our mayor is under FBI investigation. The streets are filthy and of course, there are some wonderful areas but they often become overcrowded with beggars and gangs. Every night, you can hear gunshots and police sirens just outside your window.

Details about me - A year ago, I deleted all of my social media because I had an incident with revenge porn that left me shattered, and I didn't want people to find me online. Everyone in my high school at the time was sharing the pictures, and the comments would make you sick. I still walk into a room two years later and the thoughts consume me - ""Have you seen me naked?"" I was distraught and contemplated suicide for a while. The separation from social media certainly helped my overall mental health, and I have no desire to ever go back. I have lived in the present a little more, and have worked more towards maintaining healthy friendships. Deleteing Facebook made me appreciate the world, and those that have really impacted me.

You should know that I've been suffering for years, and my issues have been made worse after I was targeted. I have bipolar disorder, a monster of an eating disorder, PTSD from a sexual assault in my youth, anxiety (social), depression and basically, I'm a walking disaster. I carry myself with a smile constantly, though. I am warm and approachable with an incredible sense of humor. I am selfless and charitable. You wouldn't know that I'm teetering on the edge. I have no friends because I'm terrified of being close to anyone due to the revenge porn (they're making the rounds online again as of two weeks ago, and guess who's been crippled because of it?) and truthfully, nobody strikes me as being worth the effort. I am ironically hugely into motivational speakers and bettering yourself and finding peace in nature, hiking, etc. And I couldn't surround myself with people that I can't trust. Which is everyone. Because after a messy breakup with a best friend who claimed he browsed revenge porn sites for the thrill of recognising girls he knows, I feel I can't trust anyone. Especially men around my age.

Details about the situation - My uncle lives up here and he's cool. My mom fled domestic abuse and lives in the deep South. We don't talk much, and I have a deep resentment for her. And my father is nonexistent. The only person that keeps me here is my boyfriend. He's a good man. And I mean that. He is honestly one of the best people I have ever come to know. Leaving him is going to destroy what's left of me.

He's tried to get me into therapy and counselling and I failed at that because I can't trust the therapist enough to open up. Instead, I lie, which isn't helping anyone. He's trying so hard but I just want to GO. Run. And without social media or anything, the people harassing me with revenge porn won't find me, old aquanitances won't find me, nobody will find me. I just need to make the choice. Start over somewhere brand new and become the woman I KNOW I can be.

They say that your environment can impact your health and the city I'm living in is toxic. I don't want to run away and don't see it that way - I see it as an opportunity to restart and make peace with all of the pain I've endured. I have about 10k in cash, which isn't much but it's more than nothing. I have a Jeep that has enough space to comfortably sleep in for a short woman. I have very little belongings, no debts, no commitments other than a decent job and a boyfriend I know I'll regret losing. And an itch to get out of here.

I don't have a plan and don't want one. I just want to drive and get the *** out of here and become who I really am without fear of nude pictures disgracing me and shutting me down. What do you think, Reddit?",1

I still hear a lot of ""You shouldn't feel anxious because I just explained it logically!""

I made a work mistake (I made several small ones - e.g inverted numbers, copied wrong info to the wrong cell- i'm a statistician btw) but now i made a big one (that my boss caught) so i essentially did an analysis however I did it wrong- forgot to do something crucial. it makes me feel stupid and inadequate then it makes me think my boss thinks that then i start to spiral and feel like i'm so dumb what an idiot i don't deserve my job everyone thinks i'm dumb here i am dumb

&amp;#x200B;

I feel like I should feel bad i deserve to feel bad I shouldn't make these mistakes. I am a waste of time a waste of space. Then i worry all day and night about all the mistakes I have made and will make and how bad I am at my job and after years of education and training why aren't i smarter I should just die their is no point if you can't do this and are so sensitive.

&amp;#x200B;

anyway that is my right i guess their is no help to be had.... i am just very sad. maybe i should have posted this in r/depressed

I just hate feeling this way, I also though think i deserve it to a point cause I feel dumb and i deserve what i get for being so stupid

89,"So I've been on sertraline/Zoloft for my anxiety for around 4 years now. Just under a year ago, I decided to begin the process of coming off it, since I'm doing much better (yay!). Since then, I've dropped from 150mg to 100mg; 100mg to 50mg; and, most recently, 50mg every day to 50mg every other day.

&amp;#x200B;

Overall, the reduction process has been pretty smooth; I've noticed a brief dip in my mood each time I reduce the dose, but no physical symptoms. Until now, that is! Since dropping down to 50mg every other day, I've been feeling woozy, lightheaded, exhausted, and nauseous - usually on my ""off pill"" days. 

&amp;#x200B;

At first, I panicked that I might be pregnant and maybe it was morning sickness, but I've checked multiple times and I'm not. This only really started when I reduced my dose again, so I'm fairly sure that this is linked.

&amp;#x200B;

Has anyone else been through these kind of symptoms when you've reduced a medication dose? I kind of expected that this might happen when I stopped taking the tablets altogether, but not when I started taking one every other day! Should I be worried? How long can I expect this to last? Does anyone have any tips for reducing symptoms? I'm at work trying not to throw up/pass out right now and it's not fun!",1

I finally found one that works for me but after the first month or so I always have a really hard time remembering to take them... I’ve tried setting phone reminders but I end up ignoring them. And I don’t have a set routine each day because I’m working multiple jobs and in school so each day is different— different time to get up, different time I’m at home vs. at work or school, different time I go to bed. So unless I have my meds on me at all times, notifications haven’t been super helpful bc I’ll get it while I’m at work and don’t have them on me. And it especially gets harder when I start having a rough time, I don’t feel as motivated to take them. And conversely, when I am doing better, I don’t associate that with the meds even though I should, so I forget to take them. So... does anyone have any ideas LOL ",1

Last year I got a tattoo from the streets without checking for safety. I got an HIV scare, started staying anxious all the time and soon developed a breathing problem. I couldn't breathe deeply.

102,"I have been diagnosed as having depression and anxiety since I was around 13. I am 28 now, and have never received help for it. I was originally in the US, and my doctor would refuse to talk to me about options, or to refer me to someone that could help. I probably should have tried a different office, because I saw several different doctors there that would simply tell me I have these things, and then do nothing. I felt helpless.

In 2017 I moved to a different country, which has caused my depression and anxiety to be on a whole new crazy level. I constantly feel like I am in ""fight or flight"" mode, and it is completely exshausting. The muscles in my body are always tight and hurting, and I am always fatigued. It has gotten to the point where I cannot leave my apartment by myself anymore. If I am with my husband, I am fine and can go outside no problem, but on my own it is a paralyzing fear. After *hours* of trying to fight through it, I have managed to go outside, and I am usually ok once I get out there, but I shouldn't have to psyche myself up for several hours just to go to the grocery store down the road. 

In mid-February I started taking a French class. It was just for 8 weeks monday-wednesday in the evening. For the first half I went to every single class, and I was so proud of myself. I thought I was *finally* overcoming my fears. Starting last week though it's like the door was shut in my face. I am right back to not being able to leave the house. I have missed several classes, and I am supposed to have a class tonight too. I want to go so badly, since there is just one more week left after this. By missing class I feel like I'm being judged by the people there, and I will just sit in my chair in a paralyzed state for hours just trying to force myself to ""suck it up"" and go. 

I am tired of living like this; it isn't sustainable. I am letting myself down, and even though my husband tries not to show it, I know I'm letting him down too. He doesn't understand the anxiety very well, so it seems silly to him at times, which makes me feel even worse. My family back in the US doesn't really know this is happening, since I'm keeping quiet about it. I have no friends either, so I feel very alone most of the time. I want to be able to have a job, to go out and meet people, to go to the grocery store without fear, to just *be normal.* 

A few weeks ago I made an appointment with my GP to find out who I should see for my anxiety and depression. None of the Psychiatres she is associated with know English, so it's up to me to find one. She did give me a paper, which I guess is sort of a referal, to give to whoever I end up seeing. I'm scared though. I'm afraid of not being taken seriously, or that my problems aren't severe enough to receive help. I know it's silly, but I still feel that way all the same. 

I'm sorry this is so long, but I have been holding this in for so long that it feels nice to get it out. ",1

I just wanted to share some things I do after (if I have the energy) or before an attack (if I feel it coming on.) Feel free to share any suggestions you might have too :)

• Baths. I also try to add some nice smelling bubble bath or epsom salt. I heard epsom salt is good for anxiety, and I tend to feel quite a bit relaxed after using it, it may help you. 

•Coloring books, word searches, and crosswords. these are distracting and help focus your mind elsewhere. puzzles are also good. 

•Kids movies! this may sound a bit silly, but I am a huge fan of the movie Space Jam. I watch it often and for some reason it’s very distracting to me and it helps me feel calm. I’ve watched it so many times but I don’t really get tired of it. I suggest kids movies because they are simple and funny and tend to not deal with topics that cause anxiety ie. death and other scary stuff.

•Cleaning. Sometimes I will clean my whole house top to bottom because it helps me focus on tidying instead of thinking. I’ll look up cleaning hacks (also distracting) and learn new ways to make my space even cleaner. Having a clean space also helps you feel a bit more relaxed too. 

•Watching life hacks videos on YouTube. They’re quite interesting to me and give me something to focus on.

A couple weeks ago was my final session with my therapist (I can reapply, however I will get a new therapist and the per session payments aren't really in my budget right now). After that session I was feeling my most confident, I felt like I was equipped with the tools to make my life better and I was in a much better head space overall. Though, for the past couple days something seems to have shifted in me. I'm no longer actively looking for employment, I've given up on getting ready to apply for school and I don't really see the point in doing anything. The only joy I seem to get anymore is when I'm with my SO. I only see her once a week and this has been working for us for the past year and a half. The more I think about having to get a job, the more anxious I become. I know that I can't exist without having stable income, but I also fear the toll my mental health will take when I lose my free time. I have had a job before, but that only lasted a month due to my social anxiety whenever I'd have to interact with customers. When I was in a better head space I'd applied for just about everywhere that would take somebody with little to no work experience and if it isn't obvious, I didn't get hired by anybody.

I'm going to try and keep this short since it's getting hard for me to focus and I'd rather get it out of the way instead of simply closing my browser. Everyday I feel like I'm being backed into a corner about the entirety of ""adulthood"". Simply typing it out has made it seem silly and that it shouldn't be a concern because everybody goes through this phase. However, the fact that I am intentionally going out of my way to avoid any sort of responsibility is messing with me. I know I need to have a job and I know that I have to sacrifice my free time in order to get it, but my free time is exactly what keeps me in a positive head space.

115,"Hi redditverse,

I’m struggling with whether or not I want to have children. I’m late 20s female. I didn’t want them till someone I respect told me I’d regret it when I’m older and that for women, family is usually the centre-place of your life. All of a sudden I started questioning whether I want them or not, when all my life I was so sure I didn’t want them. I notice babies, children all the time in my life and in the media. It’s something I’m noticing a great deal now. My late 20s biological clock went off and all I want to do is hold a baby, and play with toddlers.

I’m so anxious about it. But I can’t separate whether I want them or not from all my fears. Fears of not having them and regretting it. Or fears of having them, not being able to afford them, being a bad parent, being stuck with the massive responsibility it is to raise them. Fears of not being able to find a partner that wants to be the co-parent, and becoming infertile before I get the chance. 

And to top it off my boyfriend doesn’t want kids, so the anxiety of do I/don’t I want them is heightened by the fears of having to leave the love of my life because our life goals would be incompatible. 

I also am in an entry level job so I don’t make enough to support a child AND save for their education + retirement. Wondering if I should just not worry about that and whether having kids is worth the financial sacrifice/burden. 

I’m an anxious wreck. I’m talk to two counsellors about it so far (am currently in therapy) and nothing helps! Any advice is welcome. My mind is all jumbled up. ",1

Some dreams actually make me mad at people. I’ve been mad at my boyfriend because of things that happened in my dreams! Is this normal? Sometimes in the middle of the night I’ll be confused after waking up and literally think I’m at work or something... I don’t know what’s wrong with me. I can’t even tell if some memories I had have actually happened or if it was just a dream. Not to mention my derealization for the longest time made my whole life feel like a dream.

120,"Sometimes I worry about how easy I make it for people to use me. You always hear people talk about the “languages of love”. I’m not sure it qualifies as one of the trademarked “languages”, but I believe that I show my love through giving (in any sense of the word, whether its giving gifts, giving sustenance, giving assistance, giving emotional support, giving affection, giving time, etc.). I’m not sure if this is something I naturally do as a way of showing love or if it was learned. That is something I really fear. Do I give everything I have to those I love out of fear that I, alone, am not deserving enough of receiving love in return? When I say it, it feels right. I don’t really love myself. I can pretend. I can feign confidence for short periods of time. Those moments feel good, powerful. But it is always fleeting and I always find myself back at square one: questioning my worth, comparing myself to others, repeating previously spoken words of criticism in my head over and over. I’m not sure I can blame the people who use me FOR using me. I make it so damn easy. In fact, I almost welcome it. At this point, it seems like it would be unfair of me to stop giving so much. But I give and give until I feel empty sometimes. I question sometimes whether or not I actually ever get anything in return for all my giving. This leads me to question whether or not these people I love and love giving to actually love me back at all. Maybe they just love being taken care of. Maybe they just love all that I can offer. And these thoughts, whether they are overblown and imaginary or they are true realizations, are what fuel this original thought that I’m not worthy of being loved if I don’t give as much as I do. ",1

I can provide my background info if needed but mostly  I’m hoping people who have similar situations can walk me through the process of seeing a doctor to get a diagnosis and medication.

I’m a 20 y/o female and I had written very personal things. Before I was on my Prozac I would get very jealous and almost paranoid because I love my bf so much and my anxiety was taking over me. I had written stuff that wasn’t true or I didn’t have proof of that I just assumed as if these things were true. Examples: my boyfriend thinks this person is better looking.. my boyfriend touches himself to this cause other people are better.. let’s just say really graphic angry things. I wrote this one time when I was pissed at my boyfriend and totally forgot I had written it. I know I sound very toxic and it was very toxic my jealousy and everything. I was diagnosed with anxiety a while before dating him and had stopped taking my meds. I’m back on meds for a few months now and me and my boyfriend have been so perfect. No arguing or anything. I am very happy with him. We both have been diagnosed with anxiety so we can relate to each other. Now my mom hates my boyfriend and thinks he’s an A hole because of what I wrote that wasn’t even true and just my assumptions. I am super embarrassed and I can’t eat sleep at night (I sleep all day when not working) and am just not myself. My depression (was also diagnosed with) and anxiety are overwhelming me. I love my boyfriend and she wants me to leave him because of stupid stuff I wrote once when I was pissed. What would you do if you were me? I just feel so gross and embarrassed by what she read. I hope I’m making a bigger deal of this then I am. Then again I wrote all this stuff months ago when I was in a bad place and off my meds! Have you been through something similar? I need help :( I’m also currently finding a new therapist. I feel like my life’s over and I know it’s my anxiety talking and making me go crazy. Please help with any advice or anything. I need someone to talk to. I feel like the only thing I want to do is sleep so I don’t have to think about this.,1
130,"I always think of anxiety as a big pitched ringing. Fast thoughts, social anxiety, etc. really used to this by now.

Now I’m back to feeling dread thrumming in my chest, a sense of impending doom, nausea. The hard part for me is it isn’t about anything. With my normal anxious feelings, even if I’m stuck in circular anxiety, at least I can wrestle with them. With this I just have to wait it out. And my normal supplements and strategies aren’t really helping.",1
131,"I started a new job 3 weeks ago. This past week my anxiety has been hell and I’ve been in the hospital (causing me to miss 3 days of work). I’m pretty sure I’m about to get fired. If I get fired I’d have to move home to my parents cause I can’t afford an apartment.

I am going to assume you too have been told the ""Just breathe, you'll be fine"" followed my an empty pat on the back. I felt helpless as I was prescribed what is close to a tranquilizer to help sleep. I am a PARENT to 5 kids, and I didn't need to be in a sleeping coma when they awoke (although I would have appreciated the sleep!)

  At point of desperation I began to seek my own alternative to my anxiety's ruthless attacks. After a few days of unlimited  searches, I stumbled across a list from depression.org titled: ""You can take the first step to enjoying life again"". Sounding exactly what I was looking for, I opened my mind and decided to read yet another list. Here is what I can pass on to you if you are suffering from Anxiety and Depression, parent-to-parent:

1. ""GO TO THE BEACH OR BUSH, LISTEN TO THE SOUNDS OF NATURE AND SMELL THE FRESH AIR"" 
I live in Texas, it's so dry the river only runs twice a week. However, fresh air is always relaxing. I join the kids outside, enjoying the sun as I watched my children bike around the neighborhood, releasing their crazed energy. Although they still fought, the meltdowns created by the sound of their bickering bouncing off the walls were on currently on hold.

2. ""GET OUT AND DO SOMETHING PHYSICAL, LIKE GOING FOR A RUN, WALK OR TO YOGA"" 
I felt this was just a reiteration of the first step, but I'm crazy so what do I know?! There isnt enough peace in my house to focus on yoga. Running or walking might work, though not alone lWith anxiety, you fear every person is watching you from their windows, mortified as you pass their house. Holding one child in my arms as you push another in the stroller, dragging a scooter behind. By the end of it you are craving the shelter of your home, your sanctuary from the outsiders judgements.


3. ""GET YOUR HANDS DIRTY IN THE GARDEN""
 Perhaps this relates to you, I cannot keep a plant alive to save my life. NEXT.


4. ""SLEEP IN YOUR BED (and not in front of the television)""
Most nights I fall asleep in the rocker next to the crib to offer relief to our babies pain from teething. Or even accidently as I tuck another in as they so sweetly ask me to lay with them. They might drive me closer to insanity, but I love them with everything I have. 


5. ""KEEP A BOTTLE OF WATER IN YOUR CAR OR HANDBAG""
These are really the BEST strategies we get?? Did common sense come with that degree? I do not mean to offend those who spend hours researching topics to write. But at least BELIEVE in what you write, and know the readers are people who seek real answers.

6. ""CUT BACK ON ALCOHOL AND RECREATIONAL DRUGS""
I can only dream of being able to enjoy and FINISH a glass of wine!

7. ""EAT HEALTHIER MEALS""
You got me. I do my best, but find it easier to settle for take-out at tines. However, our body and mind rely on proper nutrients in order to function correctly.


Bottom line, the strategies online are useless, repetitive and juvenile when up against such a dark force that detaches us from mental health. Follow me as I seek strategies for us parents, and together we will finally overcome!

People have also told me to say, “hey, I’ve been feeling anxious and I really need to talk about it,” and I think that’s the easiest way to start it but I still don’t like that as a conversation starter because I feel like if I say stuff like that, then I’m asking for attention and I’m not being genuine, even though I am.

136,"It's to make you feel less anxious only? Does it makes you more motivated, makes you feel like doing the things you used to again?",1
137,"Hi all,

Made a throwaway for this, because you never know, right?

&amp;#x200B;

So, where do I start... I'm sorry if this is all over the place, but I need to vent and kinda write down how I feel and what issues I have.

&amp;#x200B;

I've always felt like I was different than others. Social cues, etc, were never really obvious to me. I tend to overthink things, I don't get all jokes (I rarely make jokes because of this reason. Or maybe I'm just not funny?). Although I can joke around with my best friends...But in general I'm doing fine I guess? I think most people like me, although I've heard – when having those drunken conversations with friends and they become completely honest – that I'm definitely kinda... ""weird"" is how they described me.

As in, I'm not super ""normal"", and that's fine, but not everyone can handle that or can get along with me because of that.I definitely feel that: eye contact is not super easy for me with some people, especially not with strangers. Heck, I've been working at my new job for 10 months and I still have issues in keeping eye contact with my boss. It's super weird and kind of annoying... I get super self conscious about it and I start noticing my facial features. It's weird. We get along fine and I don't think he really notices it, but I find it annoying.

&amp;#x200B;

Which brings me to the next topic, and is actually the reason why I made this thread.

&amp;#x200B;

Now, I work together with my boss – face to face – (it's retail, but we're focusing on the online at the moment). The others are all doing the retail jobs: sales, administration, etc, typical retail job. I don't come into contact with the others a lot. I do get along with most of them, but to be fair: I'm the youngest of them all, and they really don't have anything interesting to say. That might sound arrogant, but seriously: you won't have any intelligent conversations with them (except with my boss). They've all been in retail for years and they sound miserable – plus they only complain and complain. I'm just there to work and build my career with the online stuff, I don't give a rats ass about making friends with them.

Anyway,  there's this one guy (he's around 50 years old, I'm 27ish) that keeps making jokes. Teasingly. Like, at my previous job there was also this one guy. Making jokes about you, trying to get under your skin. I know he's joking, and I know that the right thing is to ""joke back"", but it's SUPER exhausting for me. Like, I'm busy with other stuff, I don't have time to make jokes or to think of a great comeback. And because I'm more of an introverted, serious guy, he probably feeds on it. He probably thinks my hesitance or lack of ""making a joke"" is some sign of weakness or something? It's just exhausting and I don't know what to do. There are a million things I'd like to say, but frankly, I don't think it's worth it? I just don't want to be offensive.

There's also this new woman (40-ish) that joined, and she's also seeing my friendliness and kindness as a weakness, and I don't know what to do to make this obvious. I've tried ignoring her requests but it doesn't really help? I'm starting to think she's just too dumb to understand it.

&amp;#x200B;

The thing is, I don't know if I'm overreacting or if I would be in the right to just tell her to fuck off and stop talking to me like I'm a kid or her employee or something. I really want to tell that guy to just stop joking because he's not funny and to me, he seems like a miserable piece of shit trying to sound superior.

But again, I'm not sure if I would be overreacting.

&amp;#x200B;

This post is all over the place, typed on mobile, but I hope you can kind of grasp what I'm trying to say. Not sure if this fits in anxiety either. I do have other questions concerning anxiety, but this thread would get too big.

&amp;#x200B;

Thanks for reading!

&amp;#x200B;

I do not know how or where to start on the issue I'm facing. Some background info on my mental health background. My father was diagnosed with Bipolar I in his early 20s and my mother has a history of abusive relationships before my father. So I realized very early that I was very susceptible to emotional instability.   

&amp;#x200B;

1. Background of emotional instability 
2. I have low self esteem and am currently working on improving it 
3. I do put my partner on a pedestal and he is teaching me why that is unhealthy 
4. I had a previous unhealthy relationship where we shared everything. Our room in a crowded apartment, our food, car, etc   

&amp;#x200B;

My problem: I'm in a relationship with a healthy, strong, supportive individual, but I cannot not seem to function normally when he is home. When he is home I become consumed with the fact that he is home. I continuously find things to go talk to him in his office about whether it has significance or not, I just want to be around him for the rest of the day without thinking about anything else and would not care if everything else went to shit.     


While going to make conversation with your loved one isn't abnormal, it is when it becomes the only thing you do and realize you CAN'T do anything else when he's home.  When he is not home, I do chores, take care of the puppy, read, listen to music, dance like no one is watching because no one is, etc. I stay busy in myself and if I happen to think of something that relates to him, I properly text him and don't expect a whole day and a half of conversation from it. While a lot of this is sounding very healthy, my attachment is unhealthy when he is home. I also have this weird thing where I can't seem to make or keep eye contact with him for very long when I get this way.     


I'm very tuned in to what my depression and manic symptoms look like in order to stay away from those triggers and behaviors. I'm not diagnosed with BPD, but I understand that I have to be careful. I have never come across this issue in any relationship I've ever had in any context that I'm aware of.   

&amp;#x200B;

I'm trying to find a way to deal with this anxiety I feel when my partner is home. I want to be able to function normally. My partner suggests that I try to think about the things I do when he's not home and motivate myself to focus on that. I am task oriented, so this seems like a good idea on the surface, but my mind always drifts back to feeling anxious that he's home.

&amp;#x200B;

For some context, the relationship is definitely not abusive towards either of us, and he is trying his best to help me through this. 

&amp;#x200B;

What can I do to alleviate this feeling?",1
145,"Last month my 10 year old was diagnosed with significant, but classic GAD. The severity of his anxiety is also spilling over and causing depression, so he's dealing with a lot being so young (and without trauma being a trigger). Having anxiety and depression myself for my whole life and our family being very aware of mental health, we were able to catch this pretty quickly and get him the treatment he needs. He's currently seeing a counselor every week for CBT/coping cat and a psychiatrist has prescribed a couple of different meds until he gets farther along in CBT and has the coping skills he needs to overcome this. 

He's a month into his diagnosis and only a few weeks into his treatment. We're noticing school is pretty difficult for him. We are VERY fortunate that his teacher and school counselor are incredibly helpful, communicative, and supportive of him during this. When he has the first signs of an anxiety attack, his teacher has him go to the school counselor's office or the school psychiatrist's office for a break and to work on calming techniques. Some of these techniques are playing games while talking about how he's feeling or taking a walk and talking things out. We're now frequently getting calls at the end of the school day to let us know what happened during his bad days and make sure we're all on the same page and have actions in place to move forward. His school counselor is pretty awesome and we're very thankful for that! 

We're at the point where he needs to have an informal plan in place with a list of different coping mechanisms for him. He can't get on a 504 plan just yet because he's not at the therapeutic dose on his meds. He's still working up carefully.  But, because he's so new in this, I have no idea how to help him at school yet. He's so new to CBT, he doesn't have any of those tools yet either, like working on thought-stopping techniques. I feel like we're in limbo where he's really struggling while all of this is getting started and it's a slow process to getting back on track to stable mental health.

I know we'll send him with some clay because he uses that for his anxiety tension in therapy sessions. I've just downloaded the What's Up app on his iPad and will have that for him to use when he goes to the counselors office (unfortunately, his iPad is kind of old and other mental health apps aren't downloadable). And the walking will continue. Beyond that, I'm lost as to how to help him. I know I'm scrambling for anything because I know how utterly terrible it feels to deal with anxiety and depression. I just want him to feel better and it's hard that it's a slow process. 

Even though everyone has different coping techniques, I would love to hear what you have in place for your kids dealing with anxiety in school. Thank you for the help!! ",1

I can’t go do it at the bathroom, either, because that requires a pass. I’ve only written two in all of my years of school, and I think I got them
both wrong. Not to mention how much courage it takes to go up and ask the teacher. Only for them to say no most of the time. Instead, I sniff whenever possible for seven hours and wipe a whole lot of stuff on my sleeve. Yes, it’s disgusting. 

Also, coughing. I don’t like doing it and drawing attention to myself in silence, or when someone is talking in fear of being disrespectful. I end up then choking trying to hold it back as my eyes water. It’s terrible and I probably catch people’s eyes more this way than if I could just cough it out like a normal person would.

150,"Hi everyone. 
So, I had an issue on Friday evening. I had what my husband thought was a seizure but the emergency room physician said was a dystonic reaction likely to my medication (seroquel 100mg) which I’ve been on for about two years at varying doses. 
Aside from that I’ve been having odd neurological symptoms for about the same amount of time that I’m having investigated by a neurologist currently. 
So, I’m seeing a new psychiatrist and at the request of the treating doctor Friday they have come to the decision to taper me off of seroquel, and add a mood stabilizer. I’ve never tried a mood stabilizer. This is the plan so far. She also affirmed my bipolar diagnosis made by the last psychiatrist I saw and also suspects I suffer from PMDD. But, that’s another story. 

Week 1
50mg of seroquel nightly 
450mg of depakote 

Week 2
25mg of seroquel nightly 
900mg of depakote 

Week 3
Stop seroquel 
(Start 1/2 tablet of trazodone for sleep as needed)

Just wanted to hear positive experiences with depakote. I’m trying to go into this win a positive attitude instead of being fearful.  ",1

I've never considered myself someone who is suicidal. Or depression for that matter, but I think my psychologist thinks that's debatable. So what I'm about to talk about won't pertain to that or lead onto it. 

I've been scratching my right arm for the past week. No reason to at first. No itch. Nothing there that says I should scratch but I did, for hours. I picked at the wounds until they bled. 

I realised I liked seeing it. Feeling the pain. I know it'll get infected if I don't stop. 

But it's made me think as to why I've been doing and thinking this way. 

I think I'm afraid to lose my anxiety. What would happen to myself if I keep getting the help I'm currently going through. I know I'm doing the best thing possible for me, and all the same I want things to change and not at the same time. I feel like a tilted painting: in the end, I'm still a painting.

153,"Hey everyone. A background is I’ve been experiencing extreme anxiety and symptoms of OCD for almost a year now. 

I am on a new lexapro prescription and have been for only 7 days now. In the last few days I’ve been having some pretty bad anxiety and paranoia. 

It’s going to sound a little crazy but here’s what I’m obsessing over right now. My boyfriend found a painting on the side of the road with a beautiful frame. He picked it up and put it in the car, it was in good condition and we thought we could salvage the frame. But ME, of course, decided it must have bed bugs and that’s why it was dumped. I made him throw it away but now I’m obsessed with the idea that we have bed bugs. I’m afraid his car has them and they were brought inside on our clothes. I feel itchy now but have no bites and he has no itchiness or anything most likely because we probably do not have bed bugs. I am able to think rationally but I also can not kick this idea. I checked the mattress 3 times today and my body feels pretty itchy and it’s really stressing me out. 

I have had this happen to me before, at the start of my anxiety and obsession over things I was convinced I had an STD despite negative tests and would check myself in the bathroom every 10-30 minutes at work or home. I was able to kick this after a few months but now this new problem has manifested and I don’t see my psychiatrist until April 30th.

158,"So I’ve basically had 2 weeks off work as I’ve been moving house (from my own apartment where I lived with my parter to my partner’s parents). I’m back in tomorrow and Friday for my weekly 2 days. I have been reluctant to speak out about this as I’m only working 2x a week but it’s really affecting me. I basically work in an office based civil service enquiry centre. Whilst it might seem like an easy job (I can’t really go into details), but the decisions I have to make for the callers can genuinely change their lives and mistakes aren’t acceptable. It’s a high pressured environment as it is, but working there with chronic anxiety is like hell. I’ve started getting chest pains from worrying so much about it and recently had a break down and ended up on a lot of medication. Also, my family and my partner’s family alongside many of my colleagues constantly harass me about not working there full time. The reason for this is that I used to go to uni Mon-Wed until I recently dropped out due to my mental ill health. I have thought about going full time but I can’t handle leaving the house and being around the general public for more than an hour or two so talking to people for 40hrs a week coupled with the stressful decision making, the likelihood of being abused on the phone due to the line of work and the pressure to interact with and banter with colleagues is too much for me. I’m actually getting weak knees just thinking about it. I feel so weak and other people are not supportive and tell me I’m just lazy and work shy. This makes me feel guilty so I feel like I can’t win. I feel like I don’t contribute to society and have been having suicidal thoughts at the thought of my family and others thinking badly of me. I can’t believe my life has turned out this way sometimes..
Anyway, I guess I just need to reassurance. I’m starting a new course for film and media in August which is more in line with what I want to do, so I know I’m taking steps to better myself and try to achieve my goals; however work and the pressure from everyone is cropping at the moment. I have tried to look for new jobs but everything in my area that’s part time is either cleaning jobs which would be fine but always state I need experience for, or more customer facing jobs which I don’t feel comfortable with. 

Am I being stupid not working full time? Any advice re literally everyone bar a couple telling me I’m lazy etc? 

TL;DR - I dropped out of uni, can’t work full time due to chronic anxiety, family and friends etc not supportive/understanding. Advice needed",1

At my high school we have 3 lunches, I go to 2nd lunch normally and I have friends in that lunch, but when I have a test in my 4th hour I go to 3rd lunch. I recently had a fall out with the people I semi knew in that lunch, so when I had to go to 3rd lunch I had a panic attack and hid outside of the cafeteria that whole lunch. ",1
160,"For the past year or so, I have been working from home in an industry that isn't ultimately what I want to be in. However, it is really convenient because I get to spend a lot of time with my dog and have a lot of flexibility with my schedule. The downside is that I don't get a lot of socialization with other people throughout the day and I am not making any progress towards what I was hoping to do with my life. 

Background: I graduated college in August of 2017 and was hoping to gain some patient experience to pursue Physician Assistant school. Ultimately, I ended up taking a different job so that I could save some money and pay off my student loans. Now, I am about a year and a half out from graduation and am looking to transition into the healthcare industry. 

Here is where I am freaking out/can't process what I want/need: I have been away from the healthcare industry/school for a while and am not sure that this is what I want to do anymore however, I have no other passion in life at the moment. I figure that I give a new job a try and see if I still want to pursue it. The big thing that really stresses me out about this is the money. Healthcare support jobs pay so little and I can't live off of that wage for too long (more than 2 years with my savings) in the area that I live in. If I do like it, I have to take two more classes to fulfill prerequisites (Expensive and time consuming if I end up not going down this path). My fear is that I will not get into any schools the first time that I apply. I can't stop reading those stupid forums on GPA requirements and it is stressing me out. I feel so stuck. 

This might sound kind of stupid but, I am used to being around my dog 24/7 and she has become my best friend. I am scared of being away from her for 8+ hours a day. I know that's really stupid and that most of society leaves their dogs at home during the work day with no problem. I have just been in this comfort zone for a while and can't imagine my life any differently at the moment. 

I am in the midst of finding a therapist but wanted to see if there is anyone out there that has gone through something similar to what I am going through and/or that might be able to offer a little advice/support. I am just so stressed out every night thinking about the future and find myself making excuses for myself to not make progress in moving forward. TIA",1

162,"Alright so here's my situation: I'm currently a 23 year old university student. I'm currently a senior and only need roughly 9 more classes to graduate. My plan is to graduate next year, during the spring. I originally attended community college for 2 years and transferred to my local university where I've been currently enrolled for 4 years. This next year will be my 5th year. So in total, I've been enrolled at school for about 7 years trying to getting my bachelors degree.

The problem: I have really bad social anxiety. Ever since I was a kid, I've struggled with it. As a result, I don't have much friends, I find it hard to socialize with people, and I'm pretty awkward. Because of this, I've been putting off/failed/dropped most classes that involve doing presentations or any 'social' related assignments/projects. As a result, I have about a total of 7 F's in my transcript and will probably get another 3 more after this semester is over. Although I calculated that I might still avoid being on academic suspension if I get at least an A and C or B and B for the 2 remaining classes I'm enrolled this semester. Overall I'm just tired of this shit I've put myself into.

7 classes that I need are group/presentation based. I'm taking 2 presentation/group biased classes this summer. One of them is a speech class which obviously requires me to talk in front of others in order to pass. The other is a group/presentation based class. I've took this speech class twice, dropped it the first time and failed the second time, and the other class once (failed it). At this point, if I can't pass these 2 classes during the summer, I'd rather just dropout out completely since I'll end up in academic suspension.

So yeah, overall I need some sort of advice/help. I'm planning to drink a bit of alcohol to ease my nerves for the presentation. I'm not sure if that's a good idea since I've never tried it. Illegal drugs isn't an option since I don't want to get caught and go to jail or end up expelled.

Going to a therapist or something like that isn't an option since I can't afford it at this moment and I'm not sure what my parents will think about this. They don't 'approve' mental health.

Any advice/tips will be appreciated. I'm also willing to provide more info about myself/situation since I'm not sure what else to add.

Thanks.",1

I had a phone interview and at first, I was really bombing it. Or at least, it felt like I was.

Am in the second year off my degree.
Today had a small presentation like 3 minutes and while waiting for my turn I was having a panic attack. 

By the time I spoke my voice and face was shaking. I'm mortified and so embarrassed and had to try not to cry after. I'm training in a social field so feel like if I can't even speak in front of my class should I quit now before I get even more invested. 

Today was the first time my illness impacted my studies in front of others . Usually I come across a bit nervous but not as bad as today.

168,"I’m currently 24F in the US and have been (very) single for the past 3 years. I tend to be a little bit of a perfectionist and I’m very hard on myself when things don’t go right, whether or not it’s my fault. I’m also a very extroverted person (personality type: ENFJ), I don’t know if that’s relevant at all to this situation but I’ll throw it out there anyways. 

Long story short, I had a boyfriend from ages 19-21. We were friends, I didn’t really like him ~like that~ but he asked me out and I said yes because he seemed like a nice guy. Very soon after that he became an extremely aggressive and abusive drunk, and for some reason I still stayed with him. He had sex with me against my will, he used to hit me, and accused me of cheating all the time. He also used to grope and flirt with other girls at parties when drunk. 
I haven’t had sex, kissed, or even dated anyone since 2016. 

So ok whatever, it did take a toll on me but I feel fine and I’m over it, I’ve moved on. However, I can’t get myself to go on a date. Every single time I plan on going on a date I end up freaking out and bailing last minute. The most recent time I even changed and put on makeup before bailing. 

I think I’m just scared that I’ll end up dating someone like my ex again. I even have recurring dreams of being trapped with a guy who is an abusive drunk. How can I just get over this fear and move on?",1

171,"Hey all, I am posting this now because of how desperate I was to find an account of someone taking buspirone who is -super sensitive- to meds. I've tried a few different meds over the years when I get to the point where I can't handle the anxiety anymore, but nothingggg has worked, and Wellbutrin landed me in the ER. Needless to say, I have been terrified to try anything else. 

I am exactly one week in on buspirone -- the first three days, I took 3.75 mg at night and then moved to 3.75 every 12 hours. Not going to lie, I have felt really out of it. I work in education and it's been extremely hard to focus on reading papers and helping students. My brain can now only focus on one thing at a time, which is very different from my standard operating procedure. That said, I don't really feel anxious, so there's that. Day 3 made me feel VERY panicky, but the feeling soon passed.

I've read a lot that 2 weeks is the magic number for buspirone to take good effect with fewer side effects. Hoping the fogginess dissipates and the lack of anxiety sticks! ",1

179,"I’ve been dealing with anxiety for a long time, alongside depression and autism spectrum disorder. Today, I was getting bullied pretty badly, and my stomach hurt. I went to the nurse office, and texted my tiger mom, who strictly refused to pick me up unless I went to the doctor. So I decided to rough it out, but suddenly my body started jittering, I felt like my legs were jelly, and I was sweating, breathing a lot. My heart was pumping, I felt a slight wave of fear.
Is this a panic attack?",1
180,"Hey everyone,

I could really use your collective wisdom and experience on something I've had difficulty in finding any information on.

In short, I get rolling anxiety attacks. Instead of 10-15 minutes of intense panic, my anxiety attacks last an hour minimum. However, more frequently than not they become somewhat permanent, lasting up to a month. And when I say they last, I mean my SUDS never dips below a 90, and I have constant racing thoughts, with pacing, lack of appetite, trouble sleeping, shaking and chest pain that starts as soon I wake up until I get exhausted enough where I can sleep again. I can't work because of it and my OCD.

I say rolling anxiety attacks, but it actually feels like one long anxiety attack. I'm just trying to better articulate what happens since even my OCD specialist doesnt believe I experience them as I do because he says its physically impossible. But its like, I know what an anxiety attack feels like, but for me they just keep going. I know something is misfiring in my brain.

This leads me to my question: is there another person alive out there who has some experience with this? It's been really difficult to find any information online whatsoever and I'd like even a nudge in the right direction.",1
181,"I am on a diet (keto). It is not a particularly hard diet to keep to, but a lot of fast food is kind of a big no no. Anyway, one of the things I've found that I can eat and don't mind is steak burrito bowls from Chipotle. I only allow myself out to eat food twice a week anyway, but yeah.

So I tell my friend that I was gonna get one, and she suggests I try Qdoba. I figure, what the hell, can't be much different, and maybe I'll like it more? They basically sell the same shit. Even though I've had a pretty awful time trying to order from places like these because of the nature of them.

**Big fucking mistake.**

That was over an hour ago at this point, and I have no food. She was going to try and send me a gift of an entree to, which was a really sweet gesture. Well, the whole process broke the moment I signed up.

After I sign up I find out there's a refer a friend program. Only **you cannot use this whatsoever on an account that already exists.** So, I failed the process, on the first step. And now there's no way back.

You can't delete your account, so this is now permanent. There's no tech support.

and even after all that, she can't even send me the goddamned gift because I'd have to go order in store and pay for it there. And fuck that, I'm not dealing with that anxiety ridden experience again. (Anybody else hate those ""construct your own meal"" places? It's like: Here, get in a line, and make 40 choices in 10 seconds, or else everybody gets super fucking mad at you and yells at you to just ""order what you want"", which isn't helpful because you have no idea what you want, if you knew how to make burritos that tasted like professionally made burritos, you wouldn't be going to a restaurant and paying someone else to do so).

184,"This just might become a rant and I don’t even know where to start so it also might be a jumbled mess. I have so much anxiety and fear over my future. I remember I used to LOVE school and it was my whole life and I excelled and it was something I was good at, I am a first gen student and my family really drilled it in me that an education is of the upmost importance in life. My whole family is rooting for me and I feel like if I don’t succeed and graduate, not just graduate but graduate at the top of my class with honors and be the best of the best, all their struggle and sacrifice will have been in vain and I will have failed them and myself. When I graduated high school I took a semester off because I was burnt out but taking a year off in my mind would have delayed me and been catastrophic. I feel like that was a mistake I should’ve just started on time and I wouldn’t be behind, I feel so behind. I am getting my BS in biochemistry to go to PA school in the future, my coursework is rigorous and I’m SO tired I feel like I’m running on fumes and I don’t graduate until fall of 2020 the thought of making it that far seems impossible. 
I would graduate PA school at 26, i know it sounds so stupid but I feel like I’m so behind and I’m wasting all of my 20s. 

I can’t work during school I’ve tried but it just leaves me crippled with anxiety and panic attacks and meltdowns because my coursework is so hard and I need to keep my grades up for PA school and employers are so not accommodating, so I have no money, I won’t have any money until I’m 26 it scares the hell out of me like what am I even doing? I have $400 to my name I live with my mom, I’m going to live with my mom until I’m what 28? Oh my god I will be almost 30 living with my mom, she’s a wonderful woman and my best friend and loves me unconditionally and would give me the world but I don’t want to live with her until I’m almost 30 years old. I want to live with my boyfriend of 3.5 years 

I graduate then he graduates then I get into PA school and 2 years later I graduate and then I have to work and save money and then we’re 28 and we’re still dating but living with our parents. How miserable. Moving out isn’t feasible the city I’m in is $1200 without utilities for an “efficiency” aka a room in somebody’s house, it’s insanity but I can’t work so I have no money so I can’t move to another city 
I could just not go to PA school but then what? What can I even do with a biochemistry degree I have absolutely no idea I only chose it because I wanted to get into healthcare and it fulfilled pre requisites while still being cool and fun but what do I do with that

If someone can offer some solace or advice or stories like mine that end well, please let me know I’m feeling at a loss here. I’ve suffered with anxiety for most of my life but it has really flared up as of recently and it’s become a lot to handle thanks for reading if you did ",1

191,"Hey guys, I've been a lurker on this sub for a while now, but because of what happened today I've decided to post this just to vent because it didn't go the way I hoped it would. Sorry about this long wall of text!

Just to preface this i'm 17 and have had social anxiety and general anxiety for years at this point and have wanted to get help for it, but... well, I've been too anxious to :P. I always just said i'd sort it out later and just tried to avoid or deal with the anxiety. This sub has been pretty helpful, especially seeing people who go through the same things that I do but recently its been getting pretty bad. About 3 days ago I started developing a ""tic"" which involves my head jerking back or to the side every couple of minutes/seconds depending on how anxious I am. I think this happened because I've realised how close exams are and how unprepared/unrevised I am for them and other anxiety causing things (like other people existing xD).  

Anyways, my parents decided I needed to get this sorted out if its getting too bad, so they decided to make an appointment. I was already anxious because I only had one days warning which made me double anxious. Anyways, onward to my appointment, I was already anxious because I was in public and looked crazy because of my tic and also  I was at my normal doctor but I wasn't seeing my regular GP, instead I was seeing another doctor that I didn't know.

I waited in the waiting room for a while and then got called into the room (I was there with my dad so he came as well). When I went in there was a man in what I would say was his mid 50's, with a blank expression and judging eyes (lol). He was the most monotone and slow (as in the way he acted and moved) person I have ever met. Imagine the sloth from Zootopia mixed with a ""SHHHHH"" librarian and a sprinkle of judgement and dissmisiveness. I honestly think he may have been on some sedative/drug by the way he acted TBH.  I thought this appointment would be the ""Hi, what are your symptoms, does this happen ? oh you probably have this, do this and this to make it easier/ to help"" type , I guess not. 

When I went in and sat down he just glared at me for a solid 5 seconds (why tho ?). For the next part ill be paraphrasing because I don't remember the exact things he said but ill try my best. The first thing he said to me was ""why are you here then"" in a bored voice, me being the anxious person I am just said ""well, i'm anxious, I think i have social anxiety and general anxiety"", he then said ""OK"" in the slowest and most untrusting tone I've heard for a while. He asked me a couple of questions like ""what is your default state of mind"", again being anxious I said ""anxious most of the time"", ""What is your social life, do you have any friends?"", ""Non existent and pretty much no because I'm too anxious to talk to people"". He asked about school and I said I'm doing OK, but that it's hard because I cant ask the teacher questions in class etc because I'm too anxious and don't want to be looked at or else my face goes red and my eyes start to water and also all the other things that come with general and social anxiety. At this point my face started to go red and I just blinked a lot so I was obviously visibly anxious (as well as the tics lol).   He then preceded to tell me that he ""cant do anything"" and that I should talk to a school councillor (my school doesn't have one) and maybe I should come back when I'm 18 because I could then get adult counselling and also he wouldn't want to treat it medically. Probably the funniest part was when he said that I should ""look online"" to get some help. Wow thank you! I had never thought of that!!! \\s

 The whole time I explained he had the blankest look I've ever seen on a human face. The only thing he did was print of a sheet with some websites on like the Samaritans and 2 other websites and said I should have a look. The way he went to print off that sheet literally looked like he was doing it in slow motion though with how slow/tranquillised he was. He did talk about a place in my city where I could go to look for help which is in the town centre. I'm pretty sure he didn't understand I would be too anxious to go there (my dad says hes gonna make me go there anyways :P). My dad asked about the tics and he said ""Its a physical manifestation of the anxiety"" which was probably the longest sentence he managed to say about my anxiety during this whole thing. I'm sure I didn't do this conversation justice but just imagine the most ""whatever"" doctor and then imagine them being sedated with horse tranquilliser.

That appointment was full of loooong pauses which made it even worse. Anyways, in the aftermath I'm pretty sure I don't want to go to the doctors again. My dad said hes going to get me an appointment with his doctor who's much nicer once I'm 18 (in 1-2 months) but I'm not sure if I want to. My dad agrees he was terrible so at least It wasn't just me. The only upside to this is that my mum contacted my school to tell them why I was off and apparently I might be able to get concessions (I think that's what it's called) where exams are marked more leniently. Although my head of year is going to tell all of my  teachers whats wrong with me (I think they just assumed i was awkward) because I never told them but I haven't in the first place because I never got a diagnosis ( technically still don't but I am not going to try to go back and go through that again, but he did say it was anxiety at one point sooo) and also I'm too anxious to.

&amp;#x200B;

Because of this, it has really put me off trying to get help if it will just make it worse than I started. I wish I was just a normal, non anxious human :P

&amp;#x200B;

Sorry if I over exaggerated at all, this  just happened to me so it's probably gonna be on my mind for a while ;P. ATM i just feel defeated and sad. I really hope this doesn't come off as a pity post because I just wanted to vent. Anybody else gone though the same ? ",1

but i have no skills, no work experience, no high school diploma, no form of transportation besides my feet, and i can't find a job online that i would be able to do (besides filling out surveys for maybe 3 bucks a day)

and the worst part was, i deluded myself for 8 years thinking i was fine and i could function at any time, that i just ""wasn't quite ready"" yet, and i would be good to go when my money eventually ran out. been on meds for most of the past 8 years and saw a psychologist once who couldn't help me but beyond that i never sought out any help, because in that little sheltered life i never was forced to confront that i needed it. now reality has hit and i am so, so scared. i don't want to die

I dunno how to do my hair or anything so I always just look plain or old and haggard. 

I have constant anxiety over my appearance. I use filters whenever I take photos for my friends on Snapchat. I got rid of FB and IG a year or so ago because I couldn't deal with all the drama and the insecurity seeing everyone made me. 

I hate it. I hate not looking how everyone else does. I am so jealous of the girls who are so effortlessly gorgeous and who can wear nice makeup and look good in clothes. I get so close to my face in the mirror and can't even count on both hands all of the flaws I can see. I don't know how to fix it. I've spent way too much money on face stuff and I'm still a greasy walking blackhead.

I'm not at all looking for validation but it's something that genuinely makes me upset every single day and it is impacting me very negatively. I get told that I am ""naturally pretty"" but that's from my friends and like, every single friend I've ever known gets told the same thing so that ""compliment"" does not hold much weight. 

How can I start overcoming this self hatred of my appearance? How can I stop feeling so much anxiety because of this when it's literally just what I look like and I can't change anything short of surgery and I am way too broke for that noise. 

It's getting to the point of obsession the older I get (i am 25 this year) but I literally have no idea what I can do differently with no money and with such low self esteem. 

Anxiety is a bitch. ",1
196,I don’t know what to do. I feel so anxious I can’t take it. I’ve been up all night. I feel so alone and scared. I just want it all to stop. I need everything to just stop.,1
197,"Someone recommended it to me and I was curious about anyone else's experience, since it's not always used for that. 

I get a lot of overthinking and intrusive thoughts when I'm in an over anxious phase. It's very very hard to shut my brain down and it can get extremely tiring. If I have a fight with my boyfriend or something it's pretty much bye bye sleep for that night. 

Before you suggest it, I can not handle melatonin, it gives me migraines and makes me feel horrible the day after. ",1
198,"First thing first - no idea what flair to use for this.


I recovered from anxiety a year ago exactly. I am living amazing life right now, insanely proud of it, workout regularly, got social life, I am more open, I don't worry so much, I can relax, responsibility is cool for me, colors are more colorful, sounds are clearer, food tastes better, I don't have urge to drink and so on.


But. I still feel weird about not being anxious and depressed. I know it might seem I am arrogant or humblebragging but is is a problem for me. I am so used to having problems and being overburdened after 21 years of severe anxiety that I feel weird about feeling good.  Like I have forgotten something I am supposed to feel shitty about. I am uncomfortable about being comfortable. 


It is like that old relationship, when you got abused and shat on for so long it makes you feel normal relationship is boring, you feel at home only when you are arguing and have angry makeup sex. You want a perfect girl who appreciates you, but you are so used to being in a bad relationship it is hard to move to something better. 

Like switching from your first , badly damaged and hard to drive car to perfectly comfortable and easy to drive brand new sport Mazda. 

Like switching from manual gearbox to automatic. Like you are supposed to do something with that leg but there is no additional pedal and you feel like you have forgotten something crucial yet you are perfectly fine and still going forward in an even more comfortable fashion.


What I mean is. It is still unnatural for me to feel so light hearted, laugh at everything attitude, it is weird to feel happy after such a long time. Like I am missing something because or lost something along the way. I had anxiety so long it was like half of me being who I am.  Like I am more shallow or something. I can't grasp it or understand it. Like I am somehow missing anxiety like a toxic relationship. And I feel bad for it. I know what hell it is to have anxiety yet I miss and dread that dark days at the same time.


Does anyone else feel this way?  I lurked here literally dreaming about getting rid of that awful anxiety yet I miss it. Any tips? It seems like a therapy material for sure. I am not used to feel good and it makes me confused sometimes, like I left something big behind, I feel too light sometimes.

199,Just made an appointment with an anxiety support group. Took me 15mins to be able to walk in and do it but I got there. Hoping it does some good.,1
200,"I used to be able to calm my anxiety by thinking ""i wouldn't care if someone did this, obviously other people wouldn't care if i did"" until I was like 10 when i realised that every other person doesnt think the way i do and some people definitely would care or find it weird. 

other coping strategies dont work for me either, the only things that help are music, drawing (both i can rarely do) and hurting myself, not self harm, like digging my nails into my arm and scratching. all other strategies work for a few minutes but when i think about the thought that made me anxious in the first place, im 1000x more anxious about it.",1
201,"Hey everyone thank you for taking your time to look at my post. I'm coming here to vent about my extreme anxiety because no one else understands and I feel so alone. 

Basically, my anxiety goes from one thing to another. Sometimes it is bearable and other times like now it is absolutely crippling. 

So a few weeks ago I noticed what appeared to be a little bit of blood in my dogs stool so I took her to the vet because I was freaking out. They said she was fine but I still could not settle down. 

That was two weeks ago. Since then, only two times have a seen a little bit of red and it didn't appear to be much and even though they told me she is fine I am still losing my mind. I've had her since I was 6 and am now 20. 

This morning was one of the times her stool had a little bit of red on the outside but nothing ridiculous and she is still acting normal and eating and drinking normally. I feel like I overanalyze everything to find something wrong. I worry about a worste case scenario when there's a good chance nothing is wrong with her at all. 

It impact my daily life and my studies at college are suffering. I don't spend much time out because I feel like I need to be with her every second in case something is wrong although I have no confirmation that anything is.

Thank you so much if you took the time to read this. It was more to vent to people who understand how I feel. 

Love you all",1
202,"Hey,
a Friend of mine invited me to a party on Friday. 60 People will be there. Some of my year some of a year above and maybe 70% are unknown to me. I am very afraid of going there because of my social anxiety. I mean my social anxiety is very low but it is still there so what do you think I should do besides not going to the party which I will definitely not do?:)",1
203,"Background Info: I have been professionally diagnosed with GAD (Generalized Anxiety Disorder), APD (Avoidant Personality Disorder), Bipolar 2, and PTSD. I'm a 20yr who lives with his 21yr boyfriend, three states away from anyone else I know. I can barely leave my house, and only leave for doctor appointments.

I haven't worked in a year. After a full mental breakdown at a full time night job I had at a hospital, I quit. I couldn't stay in college, my grades were suffering too much, every new job I've tried I can't take more than a couple days. My last jib I quit on the third day, because my anxiety was so bad I was passing out, and I hadn't even started my shift yet!

I've been to doctors, I currently see a family doc, a therapist (twice a week), and a psychiatrist. I've been evaluated three times, and have been medicated since I was 18. My parents don't really believe in mental disorders such as bad anxiety, stress, and barely recognize my mood disorder. They were pretty abusive mentally and verbally, that was combined with neglectful tendencies.

I feel like I was set up to fail. I've tried holding down jobs, I try so hard, but I can barely make a phone call without out stuttering and then having a panic attack afterwards. I tried work rehab, but the case worker made fun of me in the appointment and forced me into a panic episode. She didn't even stop when I started hyperventilating/crying/shaking. I ended up reporting her and leaving with no help. 

My therapist agrees with me on applying for disability, but I have no idea where to start. I brought it up to my psychiatrist, but she never really addressed it. I was taught to never accept help from anyone, so being handed money to survive is kinda a hard thing to think about. But, my bf can't keep supporting the both of us. We are living paycheck to paycheck, and still barely surviving. I'm already on Medicaid to pay for my doc appointments. Honestly, it's killing me to let him provide everything for me.

I feel helpless, lost, and like a failure. My mother even told me straight to my face that my younger brother was better than me. That she was proud of him and disappointed that she couldn't say the same for me. Mind you, my younger brother is an alcoholic at 18, physically abusive, has done a hit and run, and respects no one. Talk about a loving family. I don't know what to do anymore. I was never really a suicidal person (too afraid to die), but I feel like this is why people kill themselves, this is the feeling they have. ",1
204,"Hey guys, the title sums up the gist of my problem. My anxiety gets me through thoughts of “looking *absurdly* silly” to “everybody’s looking” to “stop it you’re embarrassing yourself, they’re only smiling for pity.” 

Deep down I’m a very “gooey” emotional person who loves listening to the same few songs he has and dance to them on occasion. Well, really, by dance I mean sway like a fool but it’s basically anything that gets my body or hips moving. However, my anxiety REALLY hinders showing this side of myself to others (even to people closest to me) because I get waaaay too embarrassed and my thoughts attack me and I stop having fun with it. At the end, this forced me to be tagged “uptight” and “like a dad” - the last one makes me laugh but I’ve heard it way too many times that whenever I try to combat my anxiety and show my “fun” side I get “what are you doing?” looks from everybody.

In the end, if somebody has a really good book recommendation on “letting loose” and/or how to change the prefixed personality people perceive I have I’d be very grateful.

Thank you!",1
205,"I have been on this medication for 5 weeks now for anxiety and panic with slight depression. 

The first two weeks were 10mg. I felt better but still had panic attacks sometimes

The second two weeks were 20mg. The first of the 2 weeks I felt absolutely incredible, but in week 2 of 20mg all my anxiety and sadness came back. 

I spoke to my Dr. and upped my dose to 30 for a week to transition to the 40mg dose. My week on 30mg started decent but then i began to feel anxious and depressed again

TODAY is day 1 on 40mg and I feel pretty good. Overall my anxiety has subsided a lot but I’m scared it’s going to bottom out in a few days... will this ever level out? Can I look forward to some consistencies in the future?? Anyone who has experienced please help a brotha out",1

The fear is that someone takes a shot on me and gives me an oppertunity and stick their neck out. I'm scared they'll do that, only to find out I'm nothing more than a fuck up and screw up and they realise how useless and stupid I am and that they could maybe give someone else the opperunity.

I could have sworn that i was having a heart attack. After a hospital stay, doc told me it was most likely stress related and prescribed me alprazolam. 

Fast forward two years... im still on the pills. Im so anxious when i get home from work, that its hard to relax. Im taking a xanax daily just to calm down. My weight is going up. I feel like crap all the time and I feel like im always waiting for another panic attack.

211,"Hey
As the title says, I'm 19 years old and never kissed a girl. This is my biggest psychological problem, and it feels like I must puke every time someone speaks about this or asks who the last person i ""hooked up"" with.

So a little back story. Im playing football, talking to girls every day at school (I have no problem talking to girls), good looking ( get a lot of compliments about my smile, and I'm well trained (got abs etc.)). We started to party with alcohol when I was 15 and goes to a party at least once a week, but I haven't hooked up with a single girl in my entire life and this kills me. I am almost considering to go to a therapist.
All of my friends have done it, most of them have had sex as well. It feels like I'm the only person in the entire school that has not done it.

I can use hours to  get to sleep because I think of this, and it's becoming a serious problem for my mental health. I will really appreciate every advice!

213,"I’m gonna start off by saying that I know group therapy helps some people and it does have a place. 

That said, my doc keeps trying to push me into an intensive outpatient program for my anxiety issues even though I keep telling him over and over that I’m not interested in the least. I’ve outlined and carefully explained my reasons as well as repeatedly explaining that I don’t have transportation to get to the center yet he keeps bringing it up. 

Yesterday things came to a head and he made me extremely uncomfortable. He stared going on about group therapy, (did I mention he runs the center he’s recommending), and said that when the meds and individual therapy, (I have a therapist), are proving ineffective the next steps are an intensive outpatient therapy program and that I “could just white knuckle my way through” and then hospitalization. WTF?!?! Hospitalization for social and generalized anxiety?!?! I haven’t had a panic attack since I can’t remember when and I’m not depressed so what the hell?!?! He really freaked me out saying that. Thinking maybe it’s time to start looking for a new doctor. Anyone have any thoughts on this or similar experiences?

214,"so hey. i guess were gonna talk about some anxiety boiz.

i basicly feel like no one likes me, every one hates me and doesnt have the hearth to tell me most of all I feel like I will end up alone.

im 14 and male. my gf recently broke up after just 5 days. and while this sound stupid, wich i know it is. This f-ing destroyed me.

i didnt even have any perticular feeling for her when she confessed. but the reality that someone liked me enough to ask me out was insanely comforting. 

having a gf makes all my insecureties and anxiety go away. but when that diseapered i wasnt even able to go to school for that day.

i always feel like im a pest. and i fear i will never be able to seek the comfort I was able to seak in my x, even though we didnt talk that much.

the only person in my life I feel i can kinda trust in my bud T-dog. but at times i feel like even he hates me (he told me when i comfronted him about it I was his best friend. and i can trust that)

just nothing makes sense. anf for those wanting to ssy im love sick,nope. I was able to dig through that mountsin in s chat with t-dog.

im just insanely insecure and have tons of anxiety. 

what do?",1
215,"Last week I was bent backwards by a huge amount of stress over deadlines and where I built up a good amount of sleep deprivation. I had a group project that was failing for which I stayed at school till 9:30pm because my friend and I were the only ones actually doing shit, which led to me not having enough time to finish my individual project due two days later, for which I stayed up till 4/5am twice and I still couldn't get it done in time so now it's not even gonna be looked at for at least until the resit... Then the weekend came and even though I have more deadlines this week (though much smaller ones) I decided to do absolutely nothing for school. Saturday was nice. I wanted to game a bit but ended up staying in bed till 2pm, then doing a deep clean of my entire room because it was a *mess*, then doing the cooking and after I cleaned the kitchen it was already time to go back to bed. It kind of left me with mixed feelings because I felt really good about finally having cleaned my room after postponing it for literally months but I didn't actually do the relaxing stuff I wanted to do... Sunday was a lot tougher because I had to work. I do tutoring and I planned two sessions of two hours right after each other because both students had their exams this week. It left me exhausted and I ended up not doing much after anymore. I just gamed a bit with a friend.

Then the week started and mayhem began. I have some thing we call seminars at my school where you  can (or have to) follow a two-week course organized by another study program within school, which allows you to expand your horizon a little bit. It's really nice and I'm doing something incredibly fun but it's super intensive. I need to wake up 6:50am each day for two weeks straight and then do a lot of physical work until 4/5pm. Add to that the sleep deprivation of last week, the two deadlines I still have to do for Friday, the usual stress of commuting 1:30 each way, and to top it off the anxiety from all the groups we need to make (each day a new one so far) and the social aspect of it in general and I basically can't function anymore. I can do anything on automatic pilot mode but anything that requires thinking is out the question. I tried solving some problems yesterday for a cool idea we had but I just... couldn't. My head is throbbing with pain from a cold and from a neck ache that's likely caused by all the stress. When I get home I can't even play games because I'm so tired, even though I get enough sleep right now. I can't believe this is normal...

Yesterday and today were just awful. Especially yesterday. I'm getting all the negative thoughts back which had left me for a good few months. It's mostly unconditional self-hatred and it's awful. I crucify myself for literally everything I do or don't do and I can't rationalize it. I hate on other people for things they did to me as if they were trying to hurt me, which they aren't. I (silently) judge everyone for doing things I don't like (mostly things about myself that I recognize in others). And to top it off I don't even know if that's what I'm doing because I know I'm in a bad place so I tend to think super negative about anything I do and blow things way out of proportions. Maybe I'm just making it all up.

Right now I feel like I'm such a creep to some of the girls at that course because... I just look at them when they talk? I just feel so uncomfortable with the thought of ""oh she's pretty"" because I feel like anything I do will immediately be interpreted as being too much. But I basically feel uncomfortable with any thought I have or any thing I do in any context and with anyone because I feel like I'm not being good enough to people around me or that I'm giving a super bad impression. And half of the people at this course are actually normal classmates of mine. I don't know them super well but at least it brings some familiarity to the room, so that makes it even worse that I'm so constantly worried about anything. I'm kind of scared to show too much association with them because it'll look like I'm excluding the others but I'm also trying to show that I like them (I don't really?) which will make me feel like I'm excluding the others. I can't focus on anything positive anymore and I hate it... Even the objectively good things that happened today feel like bad things right now... Even when, as I was going home, I felt pretty okay... And I don't have any proof that it was bad, it just automatically is bad because some other bad things also happened. Today I also had that feeling of my stomach sinking and a deep, strong heartbeat several times on a single day while it happened like maybe once a week during the last couple of *weeks*. 

I have many moments where I have a lot of doubt about whether I actually deserve therapy or even a diagnosis because so many people have so much worse problems than me (I know how cliché it is but it's just true). I have many moments I feel like I don't belong with the general group of 'people with anxiety' because I can still go grocery shopping, hang with friends and get stuff done and it's a feeling that never truly leaves me. I'm in a constant cycle of ""you can do anything you want! So just stop bothering your therapist with your petty crushes and intrusive thoughts"" to ""huh this is weird I'm feeling so good"" to a sudden ""well this is plenty proof I have anxiety"" to ""this can't anxiety but there's definitely something wrong with my mental health"" back to ""oh cool I was feeling worse but now it's getting better again"" but at all those stages I have things I avoid like the plague and things that would give me immediate anxiety if I dared thinking about them (such as imagining telling people (my therapist included) some things that (in my view) really make me look bad). Right now I'm kind of in a mix between ""I have anxiety"" and ""this is something else"" and it's not nice. I just want this gone...",1

217,"Long story short, I got on Zoloft last October a few months after I had my second child.

220,"My mom has been puking hard all afternoon. And I'm scared shitless that I will puke too, I have always had the fear of puking.

I do everything to avoid getting sick: I don't eat out unless I know for sure that the food is safe to eat, I check dates, I won't eat anything that is not completely fresh, I wash my hands all the time and I especially avoid all contact with people who might be sick.
Now I'm panicking because I was around my mom most of the time, we ate the same food, drank the same stuff, I even ate some of her ice-cream (which I trusted, mom didn't ahow any signs of being sick at the time). So if she's infected, then I am too.

The more I think about it the more intense it feels.

As I read other posts on this page, I really don’t want to let this feeling get to the point where some people are at (I don’t mean to offend).

A little backstory i moved from Asia to Europe for my college degree(comp.sci) , i have never really lived alone and I've always had people i know around me and never felt alone before, I don't really have anyone to talk to or get closure so i thought i might as well post here and get some advice and maybe how knows i might even feel a bit better

As i said i moved from Asia to Europe I've been here for nearly a year (still a first year) and my first semester was a decent semester i got good grades 8/10s in most of my classes except for calculus which i failed even though i tried my best (not really good at math) i guess that's when it happened i had my first real panic attack mind you i have failed in classes many times in high-school failing wasn't the issue facing my parents was, for nearly a week i didn't attend any calls from my mom or my dad or my sister, they were really upset obviously i lied to them and that i was on a trip with friends and i haven't used my phone because i was having ""fun"" with my friends and i dodged the question for a couple more days and eventually told them and clearly they were upset but was understanding they knew that was pretty bad in math they told me it was alright and told me to do better when i retake the class i felt a bit better i guess, but that was just the starting of the problems i started to have like a pit in my stomach even if i  just wanted to go outside to get food or do anything normal i felt like this for nearly a month but i still was stubborn about it and the second semester started, the nail in the coffin for my anxiety to just go out of control i was just about to go to enter my class when i heard the supposed people i called my friends were talking about me they were calling all kinds of bad things talking about how ugly i looked (i already had issues with how i looked because i was bullied about how i looked through out middle school right untill i finished highschool so that really hit me hard) and how they were trying to get rid of me but i was bit clingy, i just froze i didn't know what to do they hadn't seen me so i just turned back and just bolted home trying not to cry and just shut myself off from everything i couldn't even sleep without crying i couldn't even try to go to class just the thought of it makes me feel like i want to die

And that leaves me here right now i can't even talk to my parents or my sister and i'm really down right now and i don't really know what to do coupled with the fact that i have missed almost every test and assignment given untill now i'm most likely gonna get fucked by the end of the semester so yeah i just wanna get this off my chest so i can feel a bit better i guess

227,"Hello everyone,

So basically I suffer with pretty bad GAD and have some trust issues because in the end people seem to always end up blocking me. It happened quite a few years ago pretty badly to me as someone who I saw as a close friend blocked me because I kept messaging too much. Then last week it happened again to me but this time I didnt do anything wrong but still got blocked. All I am trying to do is make some friends but the fear of being rejected/blocked in the end is so strong.

Moving on I am now speaking to am American guy and we get on pretty well so far but am constantly worrying and thinking he will block me.  We got into a conversation about how his mates are into dugs and because I am against it I tried pointing out to him that drugs are bad and what made it even worse he says he occasionally also does it. We didnt have an argument or anything but because we had different point of views I was so worried he was gonna block me so I apologised so much when i didnt even do anything wrong tbh. This is not the first time either as I seem to apologise all the time and even he pointed out to me to stop saying sorry all the time. But I just feel if i dont keep saying sorry he will block me, even when i do nothing wrong.

I hope this post kinda makes sense and hopefully someone could give me some advice. Thank you for reading.

228,"I am feeling so anxious about my relationship right now. I have been with my partner for a long time, and I know he wants children; however, I am not so sure. I can't imagine putting my body through such a horrible process, and I have extreme paranoia about having a child that isn't healthy. I can hardly remember to feed and water myself, let alone another human being. I feel like I am pretty sure I won't change my mind in the future as well. Please don't comment saying I will change my mind! I don't know what to do at this point. I don't want to waste my partners time. I think that he thinks that I will change my mind as well. I think I would be okay with adoption... but I don't feel comfortable having my own children. This is just weighing heavily on my mind and I needed to let it out.",1

The part of my life it seems to effect most is sleeping (as i'm sure is the case with a lot of you). Most of the time its not a specific anxiety that keeps me awake just general worries and stress, and then I end up in a thought spiral. I was wondering if anyone had any tips on calming down before bed or tricks that you use to help you sleep? ",1

Whenever I’m in class, I feel like my heart starts racing, and not in a loving way. It doesn’t matter what class it is, I start to struggle to breathe, and my stomach makes noises- when that happens my anxiety only gets worse, and I can’t focus in class anymore- I’m too busy focusing on my anxiety and how to calm it down but it never does unless I go to the bathroom or when class ends.

Certain songs leave a pit in my stomach. Hearing John Mayer is like drinking alcohol you got way too drunk on once and now you can’t stand it. Certain lyrics make me cringe at myself and my past. I tried to move forward in my life, still listening to John Mayer and even a band I considered my favorite. But, I ended up being haunted by bad memories. I started listening to music I had never even given a chance, it’s amazing. It’s nice to get lost in a song none of my friends or family have heard. Maybe I have an odd relationship with music.

Now I'm an adult with a stable relationship and a boring office job.  I now have anxiety about the future.

234,"Hello! Okay, so I’m interested in getting back into counseling. Almost two years ago, after seeing my therapist for almost a year, I ended my therapy sessions abruptly. 

I had attempted suicide but quickly realized I didn’t want to die. This attempt happened about a month before I stopped going to therapy and I didn’t want to tell her because I didn’t want to be hospitalized. (Stupid, I know).

Today, I am feeling a hell of a lot better than I did  when I quit therapy and haven’t thought about nor attempted suicide since. 

I want to get back into therapy because I haven’t had a job in a while and need guidance getting back to working since I don’t have any current job references. 

Not only the “having no job” thing but I just want to better myself in general and I really enjoyed working with her when I would go see her every week.

I was very open and honest about everything whenever I would go and see her but this is the one thing I never told her about.

I called her today to see if I could make an appointment and still have yet to hear back.

My question is, if I tell her about this past attempt (which again was almost 2 years ago), can she have me hospitalized? Not sure if this is a stupid question. 

Again I want to reiterate that I haven’t attempted nor thought about suicide since two years ago. Honestly, I’m not even depressed nor do I have intense anxiety like I used to, I just want to get back into counseling while things are already going well for me mentally.

I think it’s better for myself to get into counseling now while things are going well rather than wait until I fall back into a depression.

Any answers would be appreciated, thanks in advance




TLDR: I attempted suicide two years ago but haven’t thought about suicide nor have I attempted it since. Can a therapist have me hospitalized even though this happened almost 2 years ago?",1
235,"Hi. 

So my situation is probably like that of many others. 

I am just now graduating from an expensive school (expensive for me with the 60% scholarship I am getting) and I have no job prospects because even though this school was expensive and put me and my parents in debt - it is still not that great of a school. 

I am super stressed about this situation that  I can't breathe, eat or sleep. I am completely broke, I can't find ANY job (i've worked in a minimum wage job, i am referring to something related to my major). 

2 months ago, I got a job offer for a place which is pretty far away from where I live, it was great pay BUT ...and get this... I COULD NOT AFFORD TO START WORKING since I can't afford to move there. 

Has anyone else felt stressed and anxious about money ALL the time? If so, what do you do about it? (please don't respond with get a job because OBV what I'm trying to do).

236,"My anxiety has gotten worse over the last few years. It comes in waves and at different levels.

But in the last year I’ve had about 5 different jobs. Two of those being jobs I would love and would be excellent for me. Prior to starting and in the first week  I end up quitting I get so worked up, stressed, overwhelmed with failing and having to learn new information I end up quitting after 2-3 days. Lasted one day the last job, most recent job offer I got hired on the spot and accepted and didn’t even make it in to the first day. 

I get headaches, chest hurts, I get kind of depressed, sometimes angry, cry, and sometimes get super obsessive of what I’ll have to do. I’ll have stomach issues, and I don’t even feel like eating. All this doesn’t happen at once it just depends.

It’s put a lot of pressure on my husband financially. I’m going to try to get back into dog sitting. It’s not a fast paced environment and no people. I just really can’t handle jobs with lots of responsibility. I need a slow simple job, that pays decent, but I guess that’s one of the problems.

Minor vertigo

Eyes hurt when moved up and down

Random tingling in extremities

Chest pains

Burning sensations in head

Tension in neck

Left cheek goes tight or numb on face

Coordination is sometimes off

IBS like stuff

Pupil size difference

Head rushes

Annual migraines (on the right side, hurts when i move my head, starts with me not seeing like a reg migraine but then i can see fine, and the pain starts, and its every year around spring or summer)

Mood swings

Little specks flash in my vision

Chest tightness

Maybe memory loss

Changes in personality (recently flirted with the idea of dying my hair when i have never had any interest in doing so, maybe even condemning it?) 

Shakiness in hands

Acid reflux
Feel like im drifting when im walking, or im gonna fall over.

Feels like im not speaking correctly or i have no idea what to say and stammer

Random pangs of pain on different spots on forehead

Hypersensitive to noises. Sometimes i can hear my neighbor snoring through his walls but i cant hear what my mom said 8 feet in front of me


These all started after my great aunt died of a brain tumor, when we all thought she was healthy. She never had any symptoms until she was having stroke like symptoms when she closed her eyes. She died a few months later and my hypochondria started a few weeks later. 

.For about 2 years i was anxiety free, but a couple months ago my dog was diagnosed with a brain tumor and died in my arms on valentines day. Now my anxiety has been 100 times worse and for some reason me wanting a streak of dye in my hair makes me think i have a tumor ( personality changes being a major symptom). But i really dont know who i am. Ive invested so much time in my dog, friends, family and video games that now that im by myself i have no idea what to do. ",1
243,"I moved to the UK in 2017 from Singapore. I had a lot of friends there and was probably what you would consider one of the ""popular"" people in school - always going out, lots of friends, parties, smart (I know I might sound snobby and cocky but I had all that back then). Now that I live here, I don't have any of that. I barely go out, I can count the number of friends I have here on one hand, I have never been invited to a party here and my grades have dropped so bad that I had to drop a year (grade for Americans). I've visited Singapore twice in two years, and both times I blew over £600 (800 USD) in less than two weeks because I was out every night with my friends, getting fucked up, going for dinner, travelling etc. Now that I can't go back, I always see my friends doing those things without me every week. It frustrates me so much to see them be happy without me because I know I can't be with them. It's not just that they go out without me, it's also that they never make time to talk to me because they are so preoccupied. Weekends have been so lonely for me because there is nothing for me to look forward to, not even conversation. I don't value my friends here at all like I do with people back in Singapore. This girl told me a secret that she hooked up with a guy in school who had a girlfriend and when I asked her why she would tell me that, she replied with ,""because I really needed to tell someone and you don't have any friends so I'm not risking anything by letting you know"". This made me feel so shit because it was true. I'm just some stress ball for her.  I can't tell my friends in Singapore that, they haven't made time for me. I can't tell my mum, she lives in Japan ( nine hours ahead so time difference makes it difficult to talk) and I can't tell my dad. My dad is a weird guy, he is the reason we had to move to the UK against every hope that I had. My mum was in tears when she found out we had to move to London and so was I. I guess it isn't that bad for her, she lives in Tokyo with her family so she has friends and stuff to do. I just realised that I have less friends than my mum or my dad. Anyway, since moving here, my dad drinks everyday. One day, he started drinking at 8:30 am after having an argument over the phone with my mum because of his drinking habits. In an effort to secretly drink that day, he put his wine in his coffee mug. Shit place to hide such a smelly drink. The day before, he had come into my school drunk and picked me up in his car. The humiliation is unlike anything I have ever felt before. I had two choices: stay home the next day and hide from the embarrassment or go to school to avoid my dad. I chose the second option. He has embarrassed me on several occasions: turning up to my football match drunk and shouting from the sidelines, initiating a massive argument with me in front of my friends, driving me home drunk, calling me in the middle of class and getting angry when I don't answer, calling out my teacher in front of me and my friends, taking the piss out of the fact that my school recommended me to a therapist... the list goes on. He did all of this while drunk. Finally, karma got to him and he fell down from the top of the stairs, shattering his arm (the doctor said it looked like a crushed packet of crisps) and stopped breathing twice in 10 minutes. I thought this was an enlightening moment for him and he would finally recover. Nope. that was over a year ago. If I was at school that day, he wouldn't have gone to hospital. A part of me wish I went to school. A couple of months ago, my mum finally came to London but only for a short while. My parents got into a massive argument again but it was much worse this time. My dad started accusing my mum of slashing his leg with a knife (obvious bullshit because there is no scar) and then threatened us with suicide. Imagine your own dad saying that he was going to kill himself if we didn't side with him. My mum wants to seperate, I want them to divorce and I want to move out. But I can't do any of that for at least a year and a half. I'm lost. I don't know what to do. All this time, my friends are just going out, having fun and doing whatever they want. They are even going on holiday to Thailand all together, except for me because I'm still in school. I hate seeing them have fun now. Nobody has to reply, I just needed somewhere to vent. Trying to see if talking or writing down how I feel helps at all. I've tried councillors but they don't help at all. They just somehow managed to make the conversation about themselves and change the subject. I do MMA to try and relieve some stress but that only works if I do well. I've fallen out of love with football because its just so shit in England. I don't have any real friends to talk to here so I can't do that. I've tried to run for executive positions within the school but that didn't work. Oh well, what can you do, hey? All I know is, as soon as I'm done with school and university in England, I'm getting out of this shithole country and moving to Asia. West ain't best. Thanks for reading x",1
244,"I’ve seen so many specialists this month. I’m now transferred to Mayo and have out of state doctors (and one international) trying to help me.

247,"I will try to keep this as short as possible! I know a lot of this will sound silly but please bear with me. I (23/F) have been a merchandiser for 5 years, the work is in retail stores and I do resets, stocking, building displays, etc. I don't work for the stores themselves -I am employed by an outside company that sends me in to do projects for different clients. Here's the catch: I have always worked with either my mom or my boyfriend, they were employed with the company at the same time so we just did all of the work together and split the pay, the supervisors didn't actually care because it wasn't really ""against policy"" since we were all employed with the company. So while working I always had a ""buddy"" with me. I liked this a lot when we first started because I have always been deathly afraid of being kidnapped or assaulted, etc. My boyfriend has a new job as of 6 months ago so I work with my mom right now, the company isn't doing so well and the hours are dwindling to the point we can't rely on it. I started looking for a new job about 6 weeks ago because I have felt like I want more independence and of course a reliable paycheck! I applied to a handful of positions, I wasn't going crazy because it was important to me to work somewhere I would feel safe and preferably work during daytime hours with other people around, other people are a security measure for me and make me feel safer. I somehow landed an interview for a ""universal sales associate"" at a reputable and HUGE credit union in my town. Keep in mind I have never had a ""real"" interview before, the jobs I have had didn't really require it- as long as I was willing and able they hired you, haha. I prepared diligently for the interview, had my boyfriend mock interview me, I researched the company thoroughly, wore very nice clothes, I was as ready as I could be. I went in for the interview scared as heck, feeling like they wouldn't see ""me"" but a walking cluster of fear and anxiety. It went pretty well I thought, but never having been interviewed before I didn't really know. I was contacted today with the offer letter/phone call. The pay is good, something I don't feel like I even deserve. The job sounds good albeit a bit confusing since this is a new position within the company. I want the job! BUT....on the phone the HR rep was talking about benefits/perks and I heard her say something about ""you are fully covered under our insurance for group travel for conferences, etc."" My stomach dropped when she said it, but I didn't interrupt or ask about it for fear of sounding like a weirdo. In the offer letter it also states this about the group travel thing, all the way at the bottom. Travel wasn't mentioned in the job listing or in the interview. Of course in my overactive mind I am thinking they are going to just throw me on a plane by myself across the country for some conference. I have never been on a plane, never traveled anywhere alone further than 40 minutes from my house and most of the time I shy away from going to stores alone because of the fear of human trafficking. SO.. am I blowing this out of proportion in my head? Is it common for banks/credit unions to send their employees all over the place all the time out of state? This is an entry level position to my knowledge, they know I have no banking experience of any kind. I want to ask the details of the travel but what if it makes me come off like a freak baby? I don't want my anxiety to ruin this opportunity for me, I have pushed myself so hard lately and I want to keep progressing. I just am not comfortable with going somewhere far all alone and possibly having a meltdown in an unknown area. This was way longer than I thought- I'm sorry!

248,"Sorry if this is the wrong subreddit for this.

All of my energy to get things done is gone. I once was an ""A"" student, and I failed my most recent math test. I've just been going through the hoops, not knowing what I want to do or what I enjoy. I'm not even sure if there *is* anything I enjoy. I don't feel like I'm good enough at anything to make a meaningful contribution either. With college quickly approaching, and no semblance of motivation or what I want to do, everything seems hopeless. Like I'll be stuck in a job I hate with a degree that I don't care about, and I won't be able to support myself, or anyone else, for that matter. I feel like I'm just going to amount to nothing because I'm lazy and a procrastinator, and no matter how hard I try, I can't find anything that I enjoy enough to stick with it. Anything the I might enjoy doing can't be made into a career, at least not a career that I'm likely to obtain. I've heard that not knowing what to do is normal at my age, that I have plenty of time left. But when college is this expensive, we don't have the money for me to get this wrong and figure out what I really want. I need to get it right in the first shot. And I think I'm too much of a procrastinator to do well in college anyway.

249,"Hey reddit,

&amp;#x200B;

I got my first ever job as a gardener and been at it for 3 days this week. Today we were cutting some bushes and I was asked to use a brushcutter. It's like a long chainsaw, but there's a round saw at the end of it and you have to use straps to wear it because it's heavy. You also need a protection headwear/mask for your eyes and ears, because it's really loud.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm a 19 year old girl and I've never used a brushcutter before. I'm not normally skittish, but the thought of having to wave that heavy thing around made me anxious and then it escalated into a panic attack. I could work with no issue around the trimmer, I even got it waved in front of my face couple times by my coworker who was inexperienced as well and I didn't bat an eye, but it was the thought of using it that got me. I spent the car trip back hyperventilating and secretly crying so my coworkers wouldn't notice. Later I told them that I was feeling sick and they said I shouldn't use the trimmer if I wasn't feeling well, so I didn't.

&amp;#x200B;

I like my job and I'm not overly girly for this profession, but somehow the brushcutter made me panic. I'm so ashamed to tell my coworkers that I'm afraid to use it, if my manager found out she'd probably have to reevaluate my capability for this work. I struggle with anxiety sometimes in certain situations but this panic attack was pretty bad. I dread going to work tomorrow, for we have more bushes to cut with the trimmer.",1

So... When I was a child (I  do not remember how old I was ) but i was entering 6 grade, a normal day, but something in a way that I do not remember changed in me, that first day of school I started to feel afraid, drowned, desperate, I just wanted to go out crying and be with my mom. From that day on, every time I knew I had to go to school, I felt that I just wanted to stay at my house with my mom, I began to have those symptoms that continued throughout middle school.

During my middle school years, this anxiety, fear and depression that I felt for having to go to school was decreasing, and it only happened to me when I had to return to school after the holidays, and when I returned to my school routine disappeared, and then anxiety returned every Sunday. (maybe sounds funny but it was real).

During my high school was totally different because the anxiety, the fear and the desperation never manifested. I think high school was my best years. 

On university the problem came back, worst than ever. I'm about a month away from graduating. 

Now im 23 old, today I woke up from bed because I start feeling anxiety (its 2:30am where I live) desperate And I started having suicidal thoughts. 

This week has been harder to me, I feel sad, desperate, anxious.  I have not been able to pay attention to my family, I do not feel the strength to speak to them, just be alone, I can not study for my exams, I am afraid of the future, the past makes me nostalgic, I just wish I could escape from this world.

This is actually a much better explination of my personality, with anxiety being a symptom. Does anyone in here equate their anxiety to neuroticism. Any discussion welcome! Thanks. 

""Neuroticism, one of the Big 5 personality traits, is typically defined as a tendency towards anxiety, self-doubt, depression, shyness, and other similar negative feelings. Since all personality traits, including emotional instability, exist on a spectrum, everyone is a little neurotic to some degree.""",1

258,So yesterday I started feeling anxious. I mainly started feeling anxious around relationships. But today I just feel worried about her and have no reason to be. I don’t get why and it’s troubling to me. I have no reason to feel anxious other than maybe having a sweet tea with sugar in it. Maybe this is the cause or just my body being anxious. I feel fine then it comes out of no where. Any help with this would be awesome.,1
259,"For about a month now about once a week I have these episodes where I'll wake up after being asleep or be unable to go to sleep and my mind starts thinking ""Well you're never going to go to sleep ever so here be anxious about it!"". This then turns into really vivid intrusive thoughts which give me even more anxiety. What scares me the most is that this is what it was like when I first started with anxiety problems 12 years ago. I loathed going to sleep because I knew I'd have to deal with this. I used to take Klonopin at nighttime for this but don't want to start on that stuff again and I'm already on the max doses of my antidepressants. Anybody have any insight on how to deal with this?",1

So, a year ago I was doing great at my job when a  very close family member passed. I quit my job because I couldn’t go into work without bawling my eyes out and panicking. I’ve been out of work ever since but I’d like to go back...however, the last few months leaving the house is something I really can’t bring myself to do unless I absolutely have to. The last few weeks I barley leave my room and don’t do simple tasks anymore...I’m wondering if this is depression or if it’s because I’m very introverted...I used to love going and running errands but now I just find it draining. Maybe you guys won’t know the answer...Has anyone else gone through something like this? I hope this made sense. I’m sleep deprived.",1

How long does shortness of breath last? I haven’t felt like I’ve had normal full breaths in a while. Usually at rest I’m ok, but it’s been tough to workout as I quickly run out of breath. 

I feel my anxiety has come down in the past few days, but I still don’t feel like my respiration is 100%. Obviously some times are worse than others... But even at the best these days.. It’s not perfect..

264,"Hi guys, longtime lurker here. i had a moment yesterday that made me question some of my actions over the past few years. I had to ship a package last night- super simple right? Nothing big, pretty straight forward- but damn I was anxious about it. Part of me wanted to put it off until the next day (and then the next, and then the next), but there was a deadline involved and I needed to get it done as quick as possible. My anxiety was high as I went in but I got the job done. Afterwards I felt strangely proud of myself-which got me introspecting. I tend to procrastinate about things that I know I want/need to do- like apply to grad school, paint more, do my damn taxes. Why? Because I'm terrified of looking incompetent. I'm terrified of not knowing the right moves or the right words. That fact alone makes me freeze like a deer in the headlights. I don't have a solution yet for this problem except for to do what I procrastinate on which I guess while deeply uncomfortable may help me.  ",1

266,"I’m a freshman (soon-to-be sophomore) at a university, and I’ve personally gone through a lot in my childhood. I’m an emotional abuse victim that suffers from diagnosed depression, diagnosed anxiety, diagnosed PTSD, and suicidal thoughts. I have a lot of social anxiety—it’s hard for me to speak in front of groups or make friends and I’ve even developed a slight stutter sometimes.

Anyway, I’m taking an Arabic class, and I’ve rarely spoken at all because of my anxiety, unless I’ve been called on. There was one time I was so afraid of speaking that after the assistant had me speak a conversation with another student, tears welled up in my eyes and I got really red in the face and the assistant felt really bad and apologized to me. 

Today, my professor called me to his desk to speak to me privately, and handed me my last quiz. He told me I’ve gotten 100’s on all his tests, and I’m his best student, but my grade is a C because I don’t speak up. I immediately cried in front of him, and I felt so embarrassed. He apologized and I apologized for crying. He told me to come to his office hours so we can talk about speaking up more, and I went back to my seat, and cried silently at my desk the entire time. I couldn’t stop. I knew people probably saw me cry, and it made me want to cry more. I’m so terrified of speaking up, but I don’t want my grade to suffer. 

I’ve thought about getting an emotional support animal, but I don’t see a therapist anymore that could write me a letter. I don’t know what to do to handle my depression and anxiety anymore. I still can’t stop crying. 

Please help me.",1

I can't stop thinking about waking up from the procedure and feeling pain. Or being nauseous and sick to my stomach all weekend combined with pain. I can't shut off the thoughts of what it'll be like after I wake up.

Every time these thoughts comes back, I break down sobbing just absolutely terrified.

I just keep telling myself to try to make it to Thursday night when I take the first Valium they gave me. And then hopefully the weekend will be filled with me just sleeping through everything.

270,"Ok so i had my physical yesterday and all went well but at the end, my doctor told me she had to tell me something and then told me she was moving locations to be closer to home. I am already driving anywhere between 25-45 minutes to see her now, and after google mapping her new practice, it will be an hour ride each way minimum. She told me she doesn’t expect me to follow her, but my doctor is sooo great that I don’t want to find another doctor, at least not right now. For someone who is a hypochondriac, she doesn’t look at me like i’m crazy and she always takes the time to reassure me that i’m ok. I’ve been seeing her on average once a month but have been thinking about extending it to every other month or so. To me, making this drive every month or every other month doesn’t seem ridiculous since i have such a great patient-doctor relationship with her, but some of my friends think i’m ridiculous for wanting to do this, what do you guys think?

271,"My partner and I live at my parents house. We run a small business which is going ok and is enjoyable but we don't make enough to live on yet and so he works another job. 

Living at home with my parents stresses me out. I love them dearly but they annoy the hell out of me and I feel like an asshole for thinking this way as they've done so much for me, but I can't help feeling miserable every hour I'm home. My mum in particular, we used to be best friends and I have no idea what changed but I find everything she says annoying. I reply with sarcasm and stupid comments because I don't know what else to say and that upsets both of us so I hide away in my room to avoid interaction, but then she gets upset because she's lonely. She doesn't work and I work from home so we're stuck at home together a lot. She also suffers from depression and she knows I do but I can't talk to her about it because she always ends up making it about her problems. 

My brother lives abroad and we were pretty close too but I fell out with him over christmas, and I'm still upset about what happened.

We decided to get a dog 4 months ago and she's so lovely but very reactive outside, and as I'm the only one who takes her out, this stresses me out a lot, which probably makes her reactivity worse - we're stuck in a loop. Inside she's great. But I get stressed out when she's misbehaving or going crazy, my parents make her worse and I'm the only one who knows how to handle it.

I feel like moving out and having my own space would fix so many of my problems, but I can't afford it, and that gets me down.

I've been with my partner 5 years and he's great but I don't feel I can talk to him about how I'm feeling anymore. I'm often crying and I feel like I'm a burden on him. I had a difficult day a couple weeks ago and I told him about it and he was supportive at first and then a few hours later said he's going away for the weekend to see his family (3 hour drive away). I wouldn't mind but it was so sudden and at a time when I needed him and when questioned it came out that my anxiety was stressing him out so he felt the need to run away for a bit. I don't blame him tbh, but he said sorry and didn't go in the end. I now feel like I have to hide my anxiety from him. 

A doctor recommended this book ""Mindfulness: a practical guide to finding peace in a frantic world"", which I bought and started reading but honestly I hate reading and I can't concentrate. I've just contacted this therapy scheme, but I'm kinda worried about how its going to go.

272,"I went to school today and I received a questionnaire about the smoking habits of teenagers. Of course I don’t smoke so I filled in “I don’t smoke” and “I don’t accept people who smoke”.

Then the next part struck me.

It was about the symptoms of smoking and I was required to fill in how often they happen: choose from Never, Sometimes, Often and Always.

To my surprise, I filled in “Often” in most of the questions, and I rarely filled “Never”.

Anxiety disorders deal as much damage as smoking.

Yet, it gets nowhere near as much attention as smoking.",1
273,"So, I'm in my 30s. I used drugs and drank heavily in my 20s but been clean for years. My memory is pretty bad because of this. I feel like I am remembering a really traumatic event from my childhood, but it seems weird that I wouldn't think of it until now. I also heard that repressed memories are just something made up for movies and tv and it doesn't really happen. I also heard that many people think they are remembering a repressed memory, but it's a false memory.

Anyway, here it is. I don't know what to make of it, but I feel like I have to confess it. I think when I was a kid my grandfather forced me to perform a sex act on him. I remember him telling me to close my eyes and open my mouth and then I felt like I was drowning. Maybe I blacked out. I don't remember the act clearly happening just being confused and terrified. I think I bit him. I remember trying to get away from him. I don't remember much before or after that. I feel like it happened because when I sit with the Idea I get this feeling of genuine sadness. It feels like I could cry even though I haven't been able to physically cry in a long time probably due to depression.

I feel like my whole life was thrown off track from this. I still made my own mistakes, but I feel like I was cheated out of a better life. I'm also afraid that this memory is manufactured to excuse me of guilt for failing to be successful and thrive. I wish there was some way to know, but he's been dead for years now. ",1

Before it was worse, but now I just can't get myself to do it I feel like it's a too huge change and I just can't. I feel anxious whenever someone I don't know wants to talk to me.

This changed for a while, when I went to a party and got drunk for the first time. I finally felt like a ""usual"" person and I was able to talk to anyone I wanted. I loved the feeling so much because it ended my anxiety. 

But anyway, I'd like to know if you have any tips or anything for how I can work on my anxiety.",1
275,"Hey friends, first, I feel like I've posted here 20 times in the last few days (which is an exaggeration, but still). So I just gotta say, I appreciate all of you on this sub.

So I am Going Through It, as many of us are. Anxiety has been through the roof, I've been dealing with a new extreme level of depression since the end of last summer, and because of being underemployed and having chosen theatre as my career path (aka never getting paid for all the work I do outside of my day jobs), I can't afford therapy or really anything that might help lift me out of this well.

I am feeling really resentful towards theatremaking because it is \*exhausting\* and I feel drained and therefore not creative and so all my upcoming artmaking commitments feel like terrible obligations--even though I'm the one that sought them out. And if I was in a better headspace, I would be so excited for them. But as it is, I'm considering cancelling a reading opportunity I was given for early May because I can't get myself to write this play I've been dreaming of for the last two years, and I'm dreading an interview on Thursday for an amazing devising residency over the summer that I've wanted to do for years.

It's all a mess. And I'm starting to wonder if me holding on so tightly to theatre is part of the issue. In the past I've felt like, my depression/anxiety can take a lot away from me, but it can't take my art...but now I'm wondering if I wouldn't be better off taking art off my plate, recentering myself as a human being, and then later on see if artmaking is still something that makes me happy.

But having said all of that (damn, sorry this is so long), I have no idea what kind of work would make me feel happy/fulfilled/not exhausted, if not theatre. My day job is an administrative type gig and I am grateful to have it, but I don't want it to become my life. I also currently live in a huge city, with a partner and a home and pets, and constantly dream of running away to somewhere totally new and starting over then. But still, even in that scenario, I'm like...but what would I do?

So, I guess, IDK I'd love brainstorms of career paths that are doable for someone in their late 20s to get into/start from scratch, that don't totally exhaust you every day. Types of jobs/fields that someone with anxiety and a lot of imagination could thrive in, instead of just survive through. Maybe y'all can't even answer this. I guess it's just, what would make me happy. And I guess I haven't really been happy in so long, so I feel really disconnected from that.

IDK! Share your thoughts if you want! Did you find your dream career path? Did your anxiety inform what kind of career you got into? Do you have a recommendation for what city I should run away form my life and go live in? Wanna make some non-pressure-feeling art with me?",1
276,Has anyone had any luck with this med? I have expressed my fears of taking this medication to my nurse and the Psychiatrist but they don't seem to care. I have asthma and I cannot even take benadryl because of it and I was told this is a massive antihistamine. I am also on Xanax 1mg 4 times a day so this medicine would most likely make the sedation much more intense and labor my breathing. I have Diabetes and this medicine can and does raise your blood sugar. To boot I have high interoccular eye pressure and that is another no no for this med but they put me on it anyway. I need some encouragement so I wanted to see if anyone else had luck with it. They placed me on 25 mg 3 times a day. They told me they are running out of options for me as if that is somehow my fault. Does it make you non functional? I read several people take 25 mg to sleep but I am suppose to take this 3 times a day how would one function?,1

I just woke up to what felt like minutes of heart palpitations ( it was probably more like seconds ). I woke up panicked, my heart was fluttering, it felt out of time. I forced myself to stand up to try and fix it. My favourite place to monitor my heartbeat is that bit in the middle of your neck, between the collarbones ( I have a feeling this isn’t at all a good place to measure ). 

I had no other symptoms at this point, just the feeling of heart palps. It took everything in me not to wake my mum and beg her to take me to hospital ( Again ). I have been tested in the past and got the all clear. But my brother died of sudden adult death syndrome and I have had a blood clot in the past where I’ve had to have brain surgery.

So now I’m lying here, heart is beating ok. I have a lot of acid reflux going on and I’m stressed as hell. But I’m telling myself I’m ok. I had no other symptoms other than the heart palps. No fainting, no pain. My heart is probably ok. I’m probably not going to die painfully.

Been going to therapy for my anxiety for a bit over a month now. And already my therapist said we should take a three week pause because I didn't know spesifically what to work on next. We usually met weekly.
I had a really good week and got to do a bunch of stuff I had been putting off. I was feeling confident since there wasn't too much to do in the near future. So I didn't know what my next 'thing' should be. We agreed that during these three weeks I would get back to working out and figure out what to work on next.

The appointment is coming up next week, I have not started working out yet even though I want to. And I have no clue of what to take up next time. She wants to work on specific 'projects'/more tangible situations and I am just back to being completely apathetic.

285,"As a child, I was so eager to grow up and act like an adult. I tried to grow up way too fast. Now that I'm 27, I just wish I could go back to being a kid and being under my parents care. I know how bizarre that sounds.

I graduated from college early with a Bachelor's degree and strong GPA, I have a full-time job and live in an apartment with my boyfriend. Outwardly, I look like a decent success, I suppose. But I worry that this is my plateau. The thought of buying a house makes me feel like I could throw up. The thought of getting married is terrifying. I do hate being the center of attention and I think that the thought of marriage scares me in large part because I hate, hate, hate being the center of everyone's attention, having parties thrown for me, etc. Cannot stand it one bit.

I am getting sick of living in an apartment and having to share parking spots and common areas with other people who don't care as much about their space as I do. I'd like to get married, I really do want to. I love my boyfriend - he is everything I've dreamed of in a guy. He's smart, hilarious, caring, and a really hard worker. I couldn't ask for anything else, and yet I'm so terrified of taking the next step. But I do want these things so bad, I am just so anxious. I overthink every decision and I'm going to let life pass me by. 

I feel like I need to talk to someone I trust about these things, but I'm so terrified because any time I've expressed hesitation to the people around me, they say, ""Well, clearly he's not the right guy if you aren't down right excited about buying a house with him and getting married."" But I strongly disagree with that. I don't ever want to break up with him and he's so great. Breaking up with him and finding someone else is not the answer, because if I'm lucky enough to find another person as great as him (which, to be honest, I don't know that I could), I'll end up in this same nervous position that I am now.

I also need to recognize that I've NEVER been excited about any life-altering decisions, even the ones that have been so amazing. Choosing a high school? Terrifying, didn't feel satisfied with my choice in the beginning but it turned out fine. College? I absolutely DID NOT want to go. The thought of moving out and leaving my parents nagged at me. That first weekend of school, I sat and cried in my dorm room. But once I finally took the leap and started making friends and going out? I was in heaven! Any time I've switched jobs, I've had horrible nerves and anxiety about it. But this most recent job I took was probably one of the best decisions for my mental health because the company and the job is so, so much better than where I was before. I never think, ""Hey, that was such a good decision!"" until well after the decision is made. Up until making the decision and even for a bit after it, I'm thinking, ""Shit, think of all the things that could go wrong. This is probably a massive mistake.""

So what am I going to do? I feel like these feelings of terror and anxiety say to everyone else that I must be in a bad relationship, but I'm not. I'm never going to get over these feelings no matter who the person is. I feel like I suck, I feel a bit worthless honestly. I don't know what to do from here. I feel so stuck where I am right now and like there is no way out.",1
286,"I’m 16M, and might delete this post later.

I don’t know why, but I feel like everyone acts different to me in an odd way (including my family). I’ll just say this shortly. Whenever I try to talk to my brothers, they’ll ignore me or say something like “that’s cool” afterwords, or when I show them something that I find amusing (like memes or a dumb vid), every single time they”ll say “that’s funny” with a straight face, and my mom will talk to me with a high pitch voice all the time. Other people besides my family, they just kinda ignore me. It feels like I’m been treated like an 11 year old.

I never see my brothers act different to each other, I’m the only one. And there friends are completely chill when they hangout, it’s the opposite for me.

287,"I'm not sure if this is relevant, but I'm 17 and my friend group consists of people ages 15-19. I've been diagnosed with Generalized Anxiety Disorder, and have had [Selective Mutism](https://selectivemutismcenter.org/whatisselectivemutism/) (SM) since I was 4 (wasn't diagnosed until I was 7 or 8).

Back in early September of last year I was added to a Skype groupchat by a family friend (15F, nickname KT for privacy's sake) of mine, who I considered my best friend at the time. Being someone with SM, I couldn't talk to them. It wasn't until about a month and a half later that I finally spoke (which is the quickest I've ever spoken to anyone--before then, it was one year, though the vast majority of people in my life haven't heard my voice in 12 years). I was already pretty close to them before I spoke, but talking brought us even closer. We were a tightly-knit family.

Now, it's April and we don't have as many group video calls as we used to. KT and I aren't as close, as I have come to realize how toxic of a friend she is (I don't want to cause drama, so I haven't done anything about it). We're all very active in our iMessage groupchat (which, surprisingly, all 20+ of us have an iPhone), and continue to regularly share memes on our other groupchats on Instagram, Snapchat, and Twitter. I'm pretty sure we have a Discord chat, too. Many of us have already met (all but about 3 of us live in the same state). We have another group meeting planned for next week. Everyone within the group has their own tiny groups (some simple pairs because they live extremely close to one another, others small groups of a few people for aligned interests), though we all remain as one giant friend circle. We make the long distance work out, and there's hardly ever any drama.

However, because I have anxiety and SM has hindered me from experiencing the average person's social life, I can barely hold a conversation. I rarely talk to any of them one-on-one. The ones that I do talk to, though, rarely do or don't give me the same excitable energy I give them. I understand that phones go both ways, but I'm aware how many of them easily text each other outside the main groupchat. In a group of 20+ people, how could none of them have bothered to text me once? There are some who I text first, yet don't get a response back from.

I started to overthink it, and took a small break from the groupchats (I was added back almost immediately, though). Because leaving didn't work, I muted them and haven't taken a look at what they're saying. I know it doesn't seem like a big deal, but I even removed emojis from everyone's names (except for one person, though I never text him). I emotionally detached, and don't feel the same joy I used to get when I see any text messages from them (after leaving, a few reached out to me privately).

This sucks a lot because this is the kindest, most drama-free friend group I've ever been in. They're my family and the only people I talk to these days (aside from family). As mentioned before, they're my main friend group--in reality, they're my only friend group. I don't want to lose them because I keep doing these things. I'm sabotaging myself.

What should I do?",1

289,"Hello everyone, I started working in a job I really wanted after being unemployed for 2 years.(yay)

However I am quite shy with people( although I learned how to deal with this when I have to work with partners etc.) and it is quite quite anxiety inducing, I dont want to seem like a cold person, but just don't know how to initiate conversations unless they do first.

Catastrophic thinking is when you feel a lump and jump straight to the conclusion that you have cancer, spiraling into a nightmare of thoughts of my boyfriend moving on and falling in love with someone else, my friends slowly forgetting me. It might just be... a lump. But these thoughts will rattle around my head all day, distracting me from getting anything done.

292,"Hi everyone. So I haven't experienced any anxiety symptoms in over a year now. It was bad, shakes/panic attacks but I somehow snapped out of it (still don't know how I did without meds) but managed not to experience any symptoms.. until now.

Now I'm experiencing anxiety symptoms again and I'm very upset about it. I'm fine while I'm at work (distractions are key, I guess)..it's not until nighttime when I feel it. Dry mouth, shakes, mainly having anxiety about having anxiety. Although when I start to experience the shakes I do prevent myself from having a full blown fight/flight situation. I can somehow control that but I don't know if that's good or bad? I had 2 crying spells last night while talking to my friend about it. (I avoid talking about it so I won't have think about it)

Also, the worst part is - I cannot sleep. I'm experiencing a weird situation where I'm about to drift off into a nice sleep but my anxiety will wake me right back up. It's like my brain doesn't want me to sleep. It's the kind of sensation you get when you are sleeping sitting up and your head falls to the side and you jerk it back up. Has anyone ever experienced this? The past 2 sleepless nights haven't been fun. I've tried the mediation apps, they aren't really working for me. My body/brain is still waking me up once I drift. I even went back to gym tonight (after months) and did cardio for over an hour to tire myself out and took Melatonin with no luck.

I took 200mg L-Theanine yesterday morning and I felt great (could have just been exhaustion and coffee, though) Because when I took another 200mg pill around 5pm, I felt nothing. I also took a 250mg of Magnesium Cirate and still did not help me fall asleep with ease. (P.S. I tried magnesium glycinate yesterday and it made me super sick) 

I hope I'm not alone on this strange sleeping problem. I don't know how long I can go on with this, I'm thinking of just going to a psychiatrist. I'm just really disappointed that I let myself get like this again. Should I just go see a doctor? I really don't want to be on medication but it's truly a struggle. Any advice or suggestions would be so greatly appreciated. Thank you!

295,"Hello! This is my first post here. I’ve been diagnosed with anxiety and medicated with sertraline since I was 16. (Now 25). 

My wife and I listed our house back a few months ago and after two long months finally sold it. We had our inspection last week and as expected some items came up. All but one mostly small things. The one big thing is that they want the outside air conditioner piece replaced as they’re claiming it’s been damaged by dog pee. We have female dogs so there’s no way that’s the case. It was hit with a weed wackier around the bottom and was dirty. We explained this to them but they insist it’s dog pee and needs replaced. To replace the unit would cost anywhere from 2-4k. 

Long, boring details aside, it’s keeping me up at night. We got their response to our proposed fixes two hours ago and now it’s past midnight and I still can’t stop thinking about it. We already have another house lined up that is our dream home and the thought of losing it because we can’t sell ours really sucks. I know that we could be in much worse a spot (actual problems like health) or barely surviving but between not knowing why the buyers won’t be reasonable and the thought of how disappointed my wife will be if this doesn’t work out is really eating me up inside.

I met a girl a couple weeks ago at a club event that I forced myself to go to and we immediately hit it off. Great chemistry, shared interests, this is easily the most interested I've been in a girl in at least 5 years. We've hung out twice now, and so begins the issue.

305,"I’ve been dealing with major anxiety now for about 15 years (32 now). It comes out a lot in social situations and also at work when talking to people especially of higher ranking in meetings.

Unfortunately, it also comes out pretty hard on sports when playing in something group oriented rather than 1-on-1. I played sports throughout my childhood and high school and never had issues but my anxiety has crippled my sport playing ability to the point I look like someone who’s never played in his life. I either overthink everything (throwing, catching, batting) so it doesn’t come out right, or my heart just races uncontrollably, my stomach feels like it’s sinking, and my legs shake and my mind just won’t turn off (pleas god don’t fuck up) thoughts. I noticed though if I’m randomly having a good game, the anxiety subsides a bit. But as soon as one bad play happens, it dominos badly and it just gets worse from there.

Tonight was probably the worst of all. 1 for 3 batting, already had a dropped flyball and with 2 outs, last inning, ahead by 1, bases loaded......I drop the easiest flyball hit directly at me. As the ball came to me I literally just panicked, made contact, and it just bounced off my glove. We lost. One of the most embarrassing moments of my life and the team wouldn’t even look at me after. 

I think I’m gonna drop out of this league as I’m embarrassed to even show my face after this. Sad part is, playing catch with a friend or going to batting cages, I do amazing. But as soon as I’m in social setting, anxiety comes and I can’t play whatsoever. Wish I could just turn it off but I can’t. :(

Probably gonna cry myself to sleep tonight. Feel so unbelievably emasculated. ",1

309,"Would you offer a seat to someone wearing a ‘please offer me a seat’ badge on a train? 

Does anyone else wear this badge? 

I’ve recently got this badge for my train journey everyday to and from work, which is of course really busy and there are never seats available (public transport in the UK is horrific!). 

I suffer from anxiety, and at its worst I feel very faint and nauseous. Due to an experience a few months ago, I’m now terrified of being sick on the train and have crippling anxiety whenever I’m on the train, ESPECIALLY when I have to stand up. I experience many physical symptoms that make it really difficult to stand for a length of time and is a horrible start to my day at work. I often have to spend 10 minutes calming myself down before going to work. 

So it’s day 2 of wearing the badge, and I’m currently stood on the train. I’ve noticed that people seem to glance and glance away. Everyone is just looking down on phones/reading books (me included) so no one seems to notice at all. Yesterday I asked someone if I could sit down and of course he offered his seat no questions asked, but that just spiked my anxiety worrying about what judgements everyone was making about me. 

Does anyone have any suggestions how to make this easier? ",1

Most of the time I do it without even realizing it or paying attention. I’ll just look down at my hand or I’ll feel the stinging of my fingers and I’ll just know it’s getting bad again. I don’t know when this became an outlet for my anxiety, but it’s become such a natural thing for me to do in response to stress of any kind that my hands always look awful and they always hurt. 

I can’t wear winter gloves 24/7 because people have to use their bare hands sometimes. I can’t cover my fingertips in bandaids because even waterproof ones get flimsy and don’t want to stay on after a few hours. I’m so frustrated and idk what to do. Sometimes I can go a few days of doing it less and I realize how much better my hands look, but it only takes a few minutes of losing my self control for it to get so bad again. 

Thanks to anyone who read this. I know it’s gross and shameful but I just feel so crappy and I want to stop. I want to wear cute nail polish and have nice soft hands, and more than anything I don’t want to feel this stinging pain that’s nearly constant at this point. ",1
311,"Things have been a mess ever since last summer, they would get gradually better and then something would rear its ugly head and knock me back down a step. Husband went to work, his gout flared up and he had to call in one day because he couldn't walk only that evening to find out that the shutdown basically was going to keep him home for awhile. Then he gets better, and gets a nice interview where things sound great and we both got the Flu. Then, once we both got over the flu, things start looking like it is going to pick back up and he gets gout AGAIN in both knees and feet. I guess I should have explained when he gets gout, I have to take over all the errands and whatever running has to be done. We have no siblings at all, his parents are dead and mine....well they wouldn't piss on fire to put me out. So it all fell on me. Then the gout clears up, he goes to the Dr and we find out that he is looking at Stage 2 Kidney failure which is causing these gout flare ups so to speak because his kidneys aren't pushing the uric acid out of his system like they normally should be doing. I made a decision that he doesn't need to be the one worrying about working and I start applying to every single job I can find like a madwoman. 

I got a nice job starting at the end of the month and we are so close to getting everything lined out. Only problem is I am worried that something is going to throw a monkey wrench in everything yet again. It seems like we have the worst luck in the world. We are waiting for his check to come in so we can get the tags renewed on the car and get some food in the house, not to mention get us moved from where we are right now. 

All this mess even though its a good mess right now, is causing me to worry and stress because I am scared that something will go wrong. I know its life, and life is never fair but for once I would like to have a break. I would love for the check to come in tomorrow (which I know it won't, it will be early next week I think), and us be moved within the next 2 weeks.

315,"Hey guys, first post here. If people are triggered by suicidal thoughts, alcohol abuse, or drunken/sleepy sex, perhaps give this one a miss.

&amp;#x200B;

This is something that has really worn me down. Basically, at a party I threw my ex and I got very very drunk. I had to carry her up the stairs, in fact, and dump her on my bed. She often needed carrying after nights out just because she didn't want to walk anywhere, or because she wanted to doze or whatever- she was a real lightweight.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway, the issue is that being extremely drunk and in a committed relationship where we both got super drunk every week and had sex after nights out, sometimes multiple times, I initiated sex with her, kissing her neck and generally trying to arouse her. I remember thinking there is no way I would do this with anyone else as they might not like it, but it's ok with her. Kind of like how in the middle of the night you'd wake up your SO by doing similar to have sex. She was moaning and seemed awake but very sleepy, eyes shut- basically, about to doze off. I did most of the work in getting her undressed, as she was basically out of it. Remember at this point I am also hammered beyond belief. She rolls over a little, and then it gets hazy. I remember more kissing and rolling around on my bed, and the feeling of being in her as she moaned in her normal way- i.e. not a way that suggested anything wrong- and then having sex hard on the floor (something we did occasionally).

&amp;#x200B;

Now, remember, this is my anxiety riddled account. A couple of days after, she asked me if she had indeed needed carrying up- I said yeah, cause she was barely able to stand (I think- am not actually sure-she'd taken a seat and walking her proved to be difficult, especially with the steep stairs, so I think that's why I carried her up). Then she asked if anything else happened she would want to know, so I told her a couple of other things then that we'd had sex for hours. Her response was ""hours"" (as a joke, I assume) and then to say that she hoped no one heard us. 

&amp;#x200B;

Fast forward a year or so. We've split in unrelated circumstances. I have to help a friend home in similar circumstances, and it gets me thinking of that time. So I begin to obsess. The details in my head change constantly, and I keep scouring reddit for help- but then I get this notion locked in my head that I've raped her, as that's the response you get when you type in my ""bf had sex with me when I was wasted"" into google. Now, here's the bit that fucks with me. I was freaking out didn't eat or sleep for nigh on 24 hours and had been drinking the night before, and contemplating ending it all, so I called my dad who called her (I don't have her number to hand, but he has my old phone at home). He explained the situation to her and what I was afraid of, including details such as the date and the location, and she was apparently very polite and sincere in saying she thinks our memories differed and that she was awake and she was fine (I only ever threw one party at that house). Obviously this helped immeasurably...at first.

&amp;#x200B;

I've fallen into a pattern of constantly needing reassurance, either from my current gf, my dad, or from arbitrary things like coin flips. Like ""Heads if you're ok"", ""If you did it a boulder will crush you, or lightning will hit you"", that kind of thinking. I don't know what I'm looking for exactly, maybe some tips for dealing with this. I know this constant need for reassurance is perhaps a symptom of OCD. 

&amp;#x200B;

My RATIONAL mind, along with everyone else I talk to IRL about this says ""Obviously, a dumb thing to have done. Could have been very messy. BUT she has no reason to lie. Probably what it was is that she was fuzzy on the details, but remembers the fact of the sex itself. Hell, if you'd had sex with no memory whatsoever of it you'd probably at least be like ""we did?"" And let's not forget, she had no issue calling you out for doing bad things (of a different magnitude and nature) when you were drunk before""

&amp;#x200B;

Other brain ""But what if she just wants me to buzz off? What if my dad lied so I won't kill myself? What if he paid her off? What if she saw it as I'm imagining it and would feel violated?""

Stuff there is no EVIDENCE for, but that I obsess over all the same. I'm very vulnerable in posting this here

I've been cleaning, cooking every day, packing him lunches etc, just to try to be more helpful and put less stress on him.

But he's withdrawing really hard and it scares me. He's always been a bit introverted and quiet when it comes to conversation, but he said maybe three sentences to me today. I asked him if everything is okay, and I can see it written all over his face that it's not. I've been with him for 13 years and I can tell when something isn't right. And tonight was the first time he wouldn't talk to me. I didn't try to push him into talking, but I did express my feelings about him hardly speaking to me, and now I feel like an asshole because I just added to his stress. 

And of course with the anxiety, my mind is jumping to the worst possible scenarios. His job in the military has one of the highest rates for suicide, so I'm worried about that.

323,"17M. I've wanted to be an artist for as long as I can remember. Just this week I decided I want to post my art online and monetize it. The problem is whenever I try to upload something I keep hesitating because I don't know how people will react to it. When I was 15 I got publicly blasted on a forum. To be fair what I said was kinda dumb and I probably deserved it to an extent. But still, that whole experience made me afraid of posting anything online. I actually don't mind when people criticize my art itself and I know that it's necessary if I want to get better, I'm just afraid it will get personal. I know that now that I'm older I probably have enough sense not to repeat that mistake, but still I lack confidence when it comes to sharing my own work. Any advice on how I can get over this insecurity? Thanks.",1
324,"So I haven't been on this forum is a while because I've been doing so much better recently. So much better to the point where the anxious feeling I'm having right now is so strange. 

Ever since I had a really bad panic attack several months ago I've become much more reserved than I used to be. For example, I have this fear of travelling too far nowadays incase I have a panic attack and can't get home so feel a sense of being trapped. As well as this, my mum and dad are away on holiday currently so I'm home alone. Usually being home myself would be great and I'd look forward to it. But now since the bad anxiety I hate being alone. The weird thing is though theyve been gone for two days. Yesterday the first night (I was fine) tonight though I'm WIDE AWAKE worrying about not sleeping for work tomorrow and just can't seem to turn off. 

Also I've got the hospital in two days because I've been having a pain in my eye/head so of course I'm thinking the worst about that. 

How do you guys stop yourselves from overthinking? Currently watching parks and rec after turning it off before going to bed (then having a panic attack so put it back on) I'm in one of those horrible ruts where I'll jump to conclusions and think too far in the future like what I mentioned about having work tomorrow. I know that since I can deal with it better these days I'll bounce back faster but I feel like I'm back to square one again :(  ",1

I have a doctors appointment set up Friday for anyone who is going to say to go there. I’m just looking for some support / ways to help calm down. I’ve tried the typical results google gives you but I haven’t found any peace.

It must be so hard for him to deal with me. I just hate myself so much. He’s so good and just takes it but I feel so annoying. I feel like I’m toxic to him and I don’t like feeling that.

328,"It was a really stupid debate about Elon Musk. 
Nonetheless the debate led into me talking about marketing (my major that I’m graduating in 1 month with). 

I left that debate feeling pretty peeved. I felt like they weren’t wanting to here me out, and that they wanted to tell me what my own major was. They boiled my major down into advertising and social media. At that point I quit debating because it was obvious that their points were coming from a place of ignorance on the very subject we were debating. 

It’s not the first time they’ve made comments about my major being “easy”. Sometimes they’ll see the median salary for a digital marketing job I’m applying for and say, “YOU CAN GET PAID $X JUST TO TWEET?!” Obviously digital marketing encompasses a TON more, especially in the last couple of years. It’s just really annoying when they say that kind of stuff. 

I’m graduating from a top business school with my degree, and it makes me feel like I wasted my major even though I love it. Marketing is kind of a misfit in the business world because it melds together data and creativity. I just think the creativity side makes people discount its difficulty. 

Part of me just needed to vent because I know it was stupid but I am still hurt and stressed about it. I’ve been up for 2.5 hours exclusively thinking about it. I just want support and open mindedness from my friends to learn about the basics of my passions. Instead it’s just assumed they already know. Ugh. I need to leave this spiral.

I do not have any images that come to my mind but the name does and it causes me extreme distress.  The thoughts do not make me think about being with them or anything they just come to my head and say “think of this....”. I do not know if anyone else has gone through something like this. I feel like I am a horrible person and my mind is telling me I am purposely thinking of these things when I know I am not.

333,"I’ve struggled with Panic Attacks since I was 18. I didn’t start having regular ones until I was 20. I never noticed the anxiety I had even when I was younger until these started happening. I’ve always been anxious in social situations ever since I was in elementary school and then I went into a career field that forced me to interact with complete strangers regularly (EMS). This is when they started coming on regularly. 

I was put on 0.25mg of Xanax as needed (never took it while working) and then the Panic Attacks started to change, the symptoms changed and I would legitimately feel like I was going crazy. I was having them pretty much every day. I started seeing a Psychologist, at the recommendation of my PCP, because I hated being on meds. I was diagnosed as having Panic Attacks with Agoraphobia. 

As of May 2016 I haven’t taken any anxiety meds like I was before (except when I needed an MRI). I thought I had learned to successfully stop them and it worked up until January this year. 

On my birthday, I had some kind of an allergic reaction to my cake and woke up to a swollen upper lip but no other symptoms (so, it could have been too much sodium that caused it too). 4 days later I ate the same cake and within 10 minutes I thought I was going to go into anaphylaxis. I was freaking out and could not stop it no matter how hard I tried. 

Since then, I’ve had a handful of times now where I’ve eaten something that is not new to me and freaked out thinking I was starting to have symptoms of anaphylaxis. I am completely rationale in my thought process. I KNOW I am not allergic to these things but I still go into a full Panic Attack most of the time.

341,"Greetings /r/Anxiety,

I wanted to post this here to collect my thoughts and hopefully get some external help understanding what exactly this feeling in my chest (metaphorically) is. I read over the posting rules and hopefully none of this violates it. I'm not asking for a diagnosis but rather I wouldn't even know how to describe these feelings to a professional if I did seek help.

I recently found myself in an odd position where I have a mental health *issue*, but it's not really an emergency issue. For context: I am in my mid-twenties and have happily been in a long term relationship since I was 16. I also had a rather (emotionally) rough childhood between regular school bullies and an unsupportive father figure that, when combined with the fact that I never really had the chance to explore myself or date others, I don't really have a lot of experience with ""Exploring myself"" emotionally. I would easily say I'm a little stunted on my emotional growth due to these circumstances, which is why I'm so confused about my situation or even how to describe it. So, *here's my problem*:

*I am a self-control freak.* I don't mean like ""haha watch me do this crazy thing without freaking out"" kind of self-control, rather I literally cannot even fathom what it's like to not have control over one's own body and my mind instinctively fights losing control. There are two situations recently that have really turned this from curiosity to a nagging source of worry whether I should seek some sort of counseling or mental health help. 

First, very recently my partner and I both got drunk. Like, drunker than we've ever been, just to see how it feels. We're big guys and making the kind of drinks we like is expensive, so it takes a lot of money and alcohol to actually get drunk. My partner was barely able to walk, he's rolling on the floor, laughing, crying over how delicious the corndog he's eating is, having a gay old time. Meanwhile, I'm sitting there just thinking about how hard it is to walk like this and what we would do if something bad were to happen while we're impaired like this. Yes, I could feel that the alcohol was slowing me down, but otherwise I literally felt completely normal other than the coordination issues. I was honestly a little jealous that I didn't seem to feel like a different person like my partner.

Second, we recently attended a party with some friends and strangers that ended in a rousing game of Truth or Truth -- nobody actually wanted to come up with any dares because we were really just trying to get to know one another. One of the questions that came up was ""What is your greatest fear?"". Several regular answers came up, either spiders, or snakes, heights, etc., while mine were tied with two very related answers: Dying to an uncontrollable situation, such as a plane crash, bus crash, etc., or getting stuck. Not like a claustrophobic stuck, but getting literally stuck in a situation where you have to wait for either death or someone to come rescue you.

A few days after the party, I sort of came to the creeping realization that all of this might be related and that maybe there's something not normal with how I feel. This was only exacerbated by reading articles about Ayahuasca and Psilocybin causing some people to break down these great walls and feel like different people after their experiences with it. This is obviously not an option as I live in America where these things are illegal.

I have this constant nagging feeling like I need to find a way to release control, to the point that I can actually feel it in my chest like a source of stress whenever it's on my mind. Is this Anxiety? Is this some form of OCD symptom? Is this literally just some form of jealousy or frustration that I just need to get over? I've tried googling this feeling but it just comes up with advice on how to better control yourself, which is the exact opposite of what I *think* I want.",1
342,"           So, I have been looking up articles and essays on social anxiety because I think I may have it. I'm not completely sure if I really do have it or if I'm just being dramatic. I have had what i think are anxiety attacks twice now, and the most difficult one happened in an overcrowded Cosco.        
There were too many people, and the building just seemed really small, and there was so much noise that it just all mashed together until I felt like I couldn t breathe- I don't know if I was overreacting or have a real attack, but it got better (not by much, but still better) once i was out in the parking lot and could see the sky. I'm kind of afraid/nervous to go back into a grocery store. This happened a month ago and I still haven't gone into a grocery store yet. Would anyone be able to tell me if I am overreacting or if I have anxiety. I would really like to know if I should see a doctor or something else. Thank you.",1

346,I do not speak Spanish fluently and am barely capable of having a conversation with someone in Spanish but am pretty good at reading to it and listening to it. The teacher today announced that we would be doing improv which meant no papers whatsoever. I started to panic a bit but calmed down when she said we would have 20 minutes to practice. However the person I was supposed to practice with is also not well versed in Spanish and she started getting panicky as well. I really started to freak out but then the teacher announced that we would be completely switching partners after and I ended up with someone who is quite good in Spanish. I tried to do it but couldn’t and eventually started tearing up and couldn’t control myself. My friend and I left the classroom and went to the washroom where I started hyperventilating and eventually fainted. The next part I only know from what I was told but she apparently ran out to the hallway to get my teacher who came and rubbed me awake and she also got our Vice Principal who is in charge of this sort of thing and I lay on the floor 10 minutes with my friend and her. Meanwhile my teacher left and proceeded to tell the entire class that I was crying because I was stressed out than after I fainted told the entire class I fainted which kind of pissed me off. Anyways after they sorted it all out the vice principal called my dad who was less then thrilled to have to pick me up. I’m thinking the teacher may have gotten in to some sort of trouble possibly because I saw her talking with our principal after while he was taking notes and I overheard heard him talking about it with the vice principal. We took home my friend as well because we where at school for longer than expected. Just looking for tips for afterwards. I’m not looking forward to all my teachers finding out and for what the teacher is gonna say to see me on Thursday when I have her again.,1
347," After realizing that I stupidly left my keys in the washer, I stopped it in the middle of a cycle to retrieve them. For about 5 minutes, I inhaled laundry pod-saturated air, and I felt slightly lightheaded and lethargic after emerging from the laundry. For the past couple of weeks, I've had minor headaches and felt less mentally able generally. I'm having trouble concentrating, word-finding, reasoning, writing, and memorizing, though I'm unsure whether the detergent inhalation has anything to do with it. Is there a way to definitively determine whether the detergent inhalation impaired my cognition? I understand that my symptoms may stem from anxiety or paranoia, but then again, inhaling concentrated cleaning chemicals for 5 minutes could very well have neurological consequences. I appreciate HONEST responses, even if they're blunt.

The problem is that I feel very scared about talking to my parents about it. I'm not sure exactly why. I think I'm self conscious that I'm trying to fit in with my friends that have anxiety by just speculating that I have mental health disorders. Or that I'm being over dramatic. It's not like my parents are mean about these things or anything, so they should be sympathetic.

Lately in my down time, I’ve felt really shakey and not quite twitchy but just like my body is on high stress mode. It’s the first time in a few months that I’ve been super busy and I’m feeling so fucking overwhelmed. I’ve struggled previously with fears that my throat is going to close up and that I’m going to pass out and die. So tonight I got the idea that maybe I was going to have a seizure!

360,"I've always suffered from self esteem issues and anxiety. I worked on myself a lot and I was very happy with where I had come. I lost 40kg, became comfortable in my own skin, everything. Then i got into a relationship and everything changed. This is my first relationship. 

&amp;#x200B;

I just became dependent on my girlfriend, always judging how she feels about me by trivial stuff like the frequency of her texts, her mood, everything. The problem is, everything will be going great and then a small thing would trigger my anxiety and everything goes south from there. I was very happy this week that finally things were going great. Yesterday we were meant to meet up after work and when i texted her after she finished if I should come over, she said maybe come over in 2 hours, I need to get some stuff done.

That triggered my anxiety and I spiraled. That just made me think that if she really loved me she'd like to spend as much time with me as possible. She has told me on numerous occasions that she has got a very tough schedule with med school and she has to put herself first sometimes so she can put me first. I just cant seem to understand this. I always take her wanting time or space to herself personally. My mind immediately goes to the worst case scenario, the fact that she's distancing herself and she doesnt want to spend time with me. I think I'm starting to become obsessive, I'm always checking when she was online, wondering what she's doing etc.

Im the type of person that recharges after spending time with the people I love. She recharges by being by herself. I just dont get how to deal with this and the anxiety piles up and takes all my motivation away to go about my day. 

When I'm feeling wanted and needed, I feel good. Whenever I feel Im being put second, I spiral.

&amp;#x200B;

Have any of you been through this? How do I deal with this and be comfortable not spending a lot of time with her? I love her very much.",1

363,"Hello. New person here. :3
I just want to share how my anxiety has begun and developed since I got it. There isn't really any real reason other than that.
I'm sorry if that is not allowed. :i

I'm a 19 y/o girl from Denmark. Here, we have a different school system. After going through public school for 10 years, we can choose to go to a gymnasium for 3 years. After that, we can go to universities.

I'm in my last year and will finish this summer. Though my anxiety started to show halfway through the gymnasium, winter of 2018. I was kinda stressing about grades at that point but it wasn't really bad. I didn't notice anything before a philosophy class where I answered something wrong. My first thought was to just dig my nail into my forarm. And so I did. I didn't worry and just went on with my life. I had a few anxiety symptoms in the following months but I didn't really care. It wasn't until I got a full-blown anxiety attack that I though to myself ""Maybe something is wrong..""
In June, the exams started. Up until this point, I had a few more attacks but I kept it to myself. I only had two exams so it was okay. But just before my chemistry exam, I had yet another anxiety attack. I overcame the anxiety just as it was my turn. I ended out with a B+ so yay. At this point, I had a feeling that I might have gotten anxiety. I'm not fast. xD

While all this was happening, I somehow drunkenly flirted me to my current bf, who is trying his best to be helpful.

The summer break was anxiety free. So I figured that my anxiety was connected to school. My theory was proven right after the summer. School started and so did the anxiety. It just picked up from where is left. It was beginning to tear at my self confidence at this point which didn't make things better. On top of that, I began to self-harm with my nails and scissors (I'm hella scared of knifes). Faster down the rabbit hole I went.
It was starting to affect my everyday life before I actually told my friends and bf about it. Seeing how sad my selfharm made them, made me stop pretty fast. They all agreed that I should talk to my doctor about anxiety. My response was something like ""It's fine. Don't worry about it. It will pass."" Spoiler alert. It didn't pass.

In the start, my anxiety was rooted in school and grades. But is slowly moved to the fear that my bf would leave me. This made my relationship with him a bit harder since some of the thing he does, would give me anxiety. I also started to communicate less with him about my anxiety because I hate to feel like a burden. Luckily, we are a good match and we normally find a way to talk about it. 
Around this point, I also started to apologize a lot. Even for things that I had nothing to do with. I only apologize when I feel guilt, but I felt it often so said sorry a lot. 

After a couple of weeks, my friends finally convinced me to talk to a doctor about it. I started talking to a psychologist in December, almost a year after the first symptoms. The first few sessions was pretty useful but I have now (April 2019) come to a point, where I don't feel like talking to The Man (that's what I can the psychologist) helps anything anymore.
I have started to selfharm again with nails, pens and bitting. In the last 6 months, I have only had two anxiety attacks though; both with my bf next to me to help and hold me.

So right now, I'm living in the fear that I will fail all my classes and the love of my life with leave me. Neither of my parents know (I keep it from them for personal reasons) but the people who knows are super supportive and I really appreciate that.
Unrelated but kinda related: I'm going to the doctor tomorrow to get tested for adah.

If you got this far, I'm sorry if it was super boring. I just felt like this was the right place to tell my story.
Thank you for reading. &lt;3",1

&amp;#x200B;

Prepare yourselves, you're in for a ramble...

&amp;#x200B;

Work: I am in Accounts Payable (43k/yr - CAN) and took on HR duties a month into my promotion. I work in the same office as my supervisor (Controller), Arthur, and I hate him most days. He listens to the same grungy, 2000's emo rock playlist EVERYDAY on speakers...EVERY DAY. I have legitimately thought about taking a pair of scissors to his speaker cord when he leaves (because I'm here earlier than him and later than him every day) and blame it on mice or something. When I started working 2 job duties it was a cake walk and I really enjoyed it. But then we hit year end, management wanted to hire many employees at once, and I was/am required to coach the receptionist (that was my job before this one) on the things management is nitpicking about. ALSO just last week I was getting reemed by the owner of our company for not getting applications quick enough so we can get some new staff (because I have control over how popular our job ads are and how many resumes are submitted as a result). I am also getting reemed by him because our current receptionist isn't meeting his standards, which should be ARTHUR's job to coach one of his underlings BUT NO...IT""S ME...THE ONE EMPLOYEE WHO MAKES LESS THAN HALF OF WHAT OUR SUPERVISOR, ARTHUR, MAKES.

 I have no time to catch up. My desk is a mess. The only way I'll possibly be able to catch up is to work OT, which I don't get paid for. Speaking of pay, I never received a salary compensation or any kind of compensation when I started working TWO jobs in one. Nothing. I was just expected to work HR alongside Accounts Payable at the same time and stay at the same salary. My annual performance review is in a week so I plan to ask for a fair salary increase but in the meantime I'm about ready to scream.

&amp;#x200B;

Dogs: I've posted on Reddit before, about my sick dog, and this is one of the biggest triggers in my life. My beautiful old man poodle, Sunny, has Congestive Heart Failure (2 years now) and Kidney Disease (since January). We decided to continue medication for his CHF and just treat the KD with special kibble. This is a HUGE financial strain. Just in May (yes next month) I will be paying minimum $350 for prescription refills (to last 3 months before I get to do that again). Additionally, one of his diuretics costs me $45/month. I was playing around with my projected budget today and realized that if any emergency were to happen with him that required any extensive vet care, or the vet recommends an increase in prescription dosage to make him comfortable, I would not be able to afford it. I would have to put him to sleep because I failed on budgeting properly - thus failing him.

&amp;#x200B;

Finances: So yes, I'm butt-ash broke. I get paid a nice salary but I don't feel it's appropriate to my work load, and my expenses far outweigh my salary. I pay for a sick dog, Trudeau instilled a carbon tax which will increase bills, my car payment is insanely high, I can't afford to buy new clothes that fit (so I wear the same outfits each week), FIRST WORLD PROBLEMS, right?

&amp;#x200B;

School: So I'm over-worked, no time for me or to even breath, no spare funds AND i'm a student part time. I am taking 3 courses this semester; passing one (weirdly enough), failing another, and just passing by on the third. My finals are next week and I'm behind. Work pays for my classes I just have to pay for textbooks (which I have to come up with the money for.......)

&amp;#x200B;

Me: With all this stress comes weight gain! As i mentioned, most of my clothes don't fit. I don't have much spare time to hit up a gym or think hard about a meal plan for the week because the small amount of spare time I do have is spent crying, distracting myself with Youtube or doggos, or sleeping. My newest symptoms (I've never had a Hollywood anxiety attack so I don't know what this classifies as) on my anxiety include difficulty breathing. I can try to practice deep breathing techniques but I feel like I'm suffocating and can't get that satisfying breath - thus leading to further stress/anxiety. Also I have difficulty sleeping through the night. Every 3rd night or so I'm up at 3:30 and maybe get an extra 15min-30min before I have to wake up for my alarm at 5:00 am.

My therapist is worried about me burning out and how I'm able to handle all this but still have a relatively positive outlook.

&amp;#x200B;

Boyfriend: my lovely boyfriend and I have been dating for 3 years at the end of April. We can't afford to do anything so that's cool. But more importantly, my emotions (anxiety/stress/depression) are rubbing off on him and now HE""S feeling the same emotions. So on top of ALL my baggage, I'm trying to make him feel less of these negative emotions because I feel like I""M the one making him feel this way. I'm broke, so he tries to help which affects his finances. I'm stressed so he's stressed. THERE""S NO WINNING.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm at work right now trying to prioritize my extremely cluttered desk in this stuffy, windowless office while it's snowing outside at 3 degrees Celsius, while trying to figure out how I'm going to have time to get caught up in work, school and life. Please send help.

&amp;#x200B;

TL'DR: I'm overwhelmed and struggling to find a balance...

Sorry if my ramble doesn't make sense. Really, I'm just trying to blow off some steam. If you read it, I applaud you!

Have a nice daaaaaay.

366,"Hello everyone,

I have been having some anxiety about graduation and student loans, and it is making me worried it could trigger a psychotic episode. I am graduating in November, I need to take one more online summer course which I am doing from July-August.

My career adviser mentioned that it would be best to do job hunting after the course ends in August, as recruiting pumps up during September. Most of my friends have jobs, not really in my field, some don't have jobs as of yet. I do have 60K in loans to pay off, as my degree was expensive and I had to spend a bit. I planned to pay my loans off in five years, with OSAP in1 year or 18 months. I planned on taking a break from around May-June, do something part time/volunteering as I do not want to get into the workforce right away. I have always been able to find a job before in my previous summers, as I am highly optimistic but with a fear of psychosis, I am worried that all this worrying can lead me to develop psychosis or a mental disorder.

369,"Okay so it seems really odd and I don’t know if this is some form of general masochism (the non-sexual kind), but I almost get satisfaction out of bad things occurring. I’ll give you an example or two.

I went to the doctors after somewhat telling them about my anxiety and such. They told me that one of the reasons I could be tired and fatigued all of the time is due to having anaemia or asthma. So I took a blood test.

The results were simply that I didn’t have enough Folic acid or Vitamin D levels, so I was prescribed medication to balance these levels.
Upon not hearing that it was anything serious or even just anaemia, I got really upset.

I can’t explain why but I always feel like this. A strange desire to have bad things happen to me.

I’ve had several dreams of getting hurt and enjoyed the thought of it. I just wish something bad would happen to me at times.

Does anyone else have this?

I guess it stems into a bigger issue which is that a loathe for a diagnosis. Having anxiety and not really being diagnosed almost makes me feel like I’m just pathetic when there are people out there with bigger struggles.

I think for some context I'm in school 8th grade and kinda out as gay, as most people assume it and ill tell people I trust and am pretty feminine I just don't like talking abt it around guys, (i know weird.) Anyways, lately, a lot of kids in my area have been getting into things like drugs and certain things like that or just questionable stuff. I don't really want to be like a part of that, not looking down at yall with addiction. A lot of kids are also talking abt other stuff like sex and stuff like that. Am I weird if I don't participate in that? I also like really keep on just getting stressed abt stuff like this. Because I honestly want to be friends with people who do it and like ignore it since its not my business but it always is like a big shock to me and like upsetting in a way. I just want to be like chill with it and not worry but I do. Its just something weird about me and I don't know why. Same for other things to like sex. Also recently I've become really sensitive to small things. I might go into that in some other post but like if somebody even mentions if somebody doesn't like me I freak out and just feel terrible. Last thing I'm also kind of just want to be mean and judge people. It's terrible but it becoming kinda mean and I know a lot of kids think I'm bitchy. I like to have a sarcastic sense of humor and I will be pretty rude and then play it off like I'm just kidding. but I'm kind of not. It's so bad because i don't want to be that bitchy kid I want to be nice like I really am. For instance, this kind of mean jock kid became friends with a close friend of mine so I did a bit of digging. I lie found out his mom used to be an ex-alcoholic and he used to be addicted to drugs but quit. He kind of has never been nice to me and a bit homophobic in the past and I've had the urge to just mock him for having a shit home life. Idk I have anxiety and ADHD too so I've gotten panic attacks because I'm imagining the terrible person I could become. Also see the background is pretty popular at my school for being the gay one and I'm pretty funny and outgoing but, most of the guys don't like me so a lot of my friends are girls which I used to get bullied for.

376,"I've finally started therapy to deal with the crippling social anxiety that has left me unable to work or date properly for years. My third session was yesterday, and my therapist and I broke down the three components of SA: physiological, cognitive, and behavioral. She drew the ""social anxiety spiral"" on a whiteboard, using my worst ever incident of SA as a basis, and my god...it was like seeing the genetic code of it all laid out before my eyes.

What had so long been a terrible memory and source of shame had been disassembled in an almost scientific way! I recreated it to the best of my recollection when I got home, and I'd like to share it here, because I'm proud of it, and maybe even to help others who are struggling, who might not have begun a journey of recovery. It is a cycle, and it can be pulled apart and analyzed, and when true understanding of how everything works in concert and feeds off of each other begins, SA's totalitarian control over life starts to waver.

FRIEND'S BIRTHDAY PARTY ANXIETY SPIRAL:

First Thought (Cognition): “I won’t know anybody there” / ""I won’t know how to start a conversation”

First Physical Reaction (Physiological): Heart palpations and tightness in chest

Action (Behavioral): Freezing in place

Second Thought (Cognition): “What if nobody likes me?

Second Physical Reaction (Physiological): Shortness of breath and flushing

Action (Behavioral): “Run” (fleeing the scene and walking for ten minutes to try to burn off energy and calm myself)

Third Thought (Cognition): “What’s wrong with me? Why can’t I just go inside? I’m such a broken person. I can’t deal with this anymore. I’m going home.”

Action (Behavioral): Send a text explaining I’ve fallen ill and won’t be attending the party.

Third Physical Reaction (Physiological): Instantaneous relief of physical symptoms

Conclusion: Physically relieved but emotionally ashamed, reinforcing my longstanding belief that I am broken and a failure. Depression sets in.

This is it. This is the formula that makes my anxiety operate. For the first time, divorced from emotional and physical effects, I'm looking it in the face. It's an amazing feeling.

377,"This is going to sound extremely stupid, but I'm graduating in the spring and I really, REALLY don't want to walk. My  college is pretty big, and my highschool was very small, so the graduating class size difference is huge, and knowing that so many people are going to be there makes me ill. I can hardly walk across a 20 person classroom without feeling anxious, and I just know it's going to be hell.

I was attempting to order my cap and gown and the price was ridiculous, so I tried to call my dad and lowkey began to beg him to not make me attend. 

He took it as he thought I wasn't going to graduate at all (which is incorrect, I'm actually graduating a year early), or that I was failing a class, and then just told me I was doing it, then pulled the card about how he didn't graduate and how he wanted to see his kid do it. I told him he saw both my brother and will see my sister graduate (likely twice, for my sister since she's doing graduate school), but he wasn't satiated.  
I told him it makes me extremely uncomfortable to have so much attention on me and admittedly at this point I started crying, but literally like, no sympathy; he told me I should've thought about this before I told our family I was graduating and everyone started making plans. He also said that it would only be 2,3 hours of me being uncomfortable and I should deal with that since my family is coming. He also pulled the amount of student debt loans he will be paying off for me, and it only stressed me out more.  
I asked him why couldn't we just like, get food or something and just celebrate it lowkey and he told me because my family is coming to see me graduate, not eat food, and I would be disappointing them and essentially, even though I told him I was uncomfortable, that the massive amount of people being there and the attention was really stressing me out, and I was lowkey crying during this, I still have to walk regardless of my feelings.  


I just don't know what to do, and I'm wondering if other people have had the same anxiety, even if it's ridiculous...

379,"To keep a long story short, I suffered what I believe was my first (non weed induced) panic attack around 8 years ago. It left me in a weird state (dp/dr) for months where I obsessed over what was wrong with me and could hardly think of anything else.

I eventually got over that by joining sports and just trying to forget about it, never took any medication and had a brief stint of counseling at my university a few years later which seemed to work out okay but I think I'd need more professional help. And I've been mostly okayish since then.

These days, my dp/dr doesn't bother me much unless I'm actively thinking about it. But there are definitely things I can't think about and places in my mind I can't go without feeling like a panic attack will come along, even though I haven't had a full blown attack in a long time. I feel like some activities are off limits as I feel they'll send me spiraling back into panic, such as watching a ghost/possession related tv show or movie, which is what I believe triggered my first attack, smoking weed or doing any kind of drug at all (trying CBD put me on edge the first few times I tried it just from being in my own head about it).

I get pretty bad anxiety (tight stomach, racing thoughts, bad bowel movements) when there's some kind of new social situation I'm obligated to go to that day and I'm stressed about. I'm also pretty motivated for most things in my life (trouble getting out of bed in the morning, trouble getting my work done, trouble doing things I enjoy after work) and have been feeling pretty down lately, which is weird because I'd usually describe myself as somewhat emotionless and unenthusiastic.

I guess that wasn't such a short story, but I want to get help and I don't know where to start. I have health insurance, but I don't know where to took for a therapist. And do I see a therapist first or go straight to a psych?

Over the past few days I have been afraid that I have been developing Schizophrenia. It first started when I read about it after believing that I may have experienced an smell hallucination.  I got really freaked out and on Sunday, I started thinking about my future (I am graduating this year) and I felt really stressed. I was worried that it would trigger the onset of Schizophrenia, as I was really stressed when I thought about it and felt a bit of a failure because I have not been able to find a job as of late (Got 2 interviews this . All of a sudden, I got an intrusive thought that said ""You're a failure"" and I freaked out I thought that I was hearing voices in my head.  I didn't hear it again, but the next day I was doing my home work, I remembered that I did not hear the thought again, but then suddenly I thought of the thought again, and then I become hyper aware and was just doing my work but being on guard for the thought again, when I heard again another time. Later though, I did not hear it again and today I have heard it but when only I thought about it. I am not hearing this intrusive thought out loud or like a real life human voice, its in my head. I was wondering if anyone else has not had intrusive thoughts that go like ""You're a failure"", ""You're stupid"" throughout the day.

I also read about tactile hallucinations, especially the crawling with bugs. Yesterday as I was lying in bed, my body started feeling itchy and it felt like the bugs sensation and I felt this throughout the day today and a little bit yesterday. I am worried I am experiencing tactile hallucinations, thought I am wondering if this is due to my dry skin as I do not lotion my body and I am wearing a lot of layers - as well I am being constantly aware of my body surroundings to make sure everything feels right. Its not too much of a crawling sensation, its like a tingling itch that sometimes feels like bugs.

I'm from Canada and my first test attempt was a total disaster (I was 17) due to my mom's stubbornness and refusal to ever let me drive alone and to get me an instructor. The examiner knew immediately I wasn't going to pass so he asked me to explain what was wrong. I did and he told my mother that her refusal to let me drive alone and to get an instructor were irresponsible since the whole point of the test is to see if a driver can handle a vehicle by themselves.

Anyhoo so I did pass the 2nd time cause we got an instructor. But after that I never really drove cause I couldn't afford a car and Toronto's public transit system served me well. Then I moved to LA and got around by carpooling and Uber.

I'm dealing with anxiety problem for years. I'm feeling nauseous usually and threw up. Thankfully for this meeting I didn't feel sick. Since I recently graduated and landed this job, I didn't have many chance to speak up in public so this wasn't a problem for me. All I did was studying. But now I realize it's a very important issue and can affect my career. 

Now we will have another meeting next week. It will be conducted in English which is not my first language and I've learned it by myself so I'm feeling super unconfident and anxious right now. Also supervisor I'm attending with is not the kind that has lots of experience, so probably she will rely on me during the meeting.

Do you guys have any suggestions or know how about how to speak properly in public? Thanks a lot even for reading this. And excuse my bad English :(

388,"I have dealt with anxiety for all of my life. I grew up in an abusive household and finally left with my Mom about 8 years ago. However, my anxiety doesn’t seem to get any better. Therapy and meds for around 8-9 years, counseling, etc. Can’t hold a job because my mind doesn’t stop running and I have constant anxiety and panic attacks. The last 3 jobs I’ve had have been roles that require a lot of responsibility and my mind doesn’t handle it well. I worked retail and at a vineyard and didn’t have anxiety issues with those roles. I am at a loss because those three jobs I have quit on the first day. I find myself emotionally and mentally exhausted anytime I go to work or leave the house in general. I just wait to come home and don’t want to leave when I am here. 

I am confused on what to do. I am going to see my therapist next week. My heart beats thru my chest all day and I cry and cry because I don’t know what else to do. I feel like I am bound to spend my life in my house and I don’t want that for myself.  I feel this is what my life will always be. ",1
389,THE LAST TWO DAYS I have slept the whole day...like the entire day I would wake up for a hour or two and fall asleep...sitting up. Everytime I stand up I feel like I'm gonna pass out...I passed out in the bathroom fun fact. I am taking 25 mg twice a day...I CAN ONLY TAKE ONE AND I AM BASICALLY DEAD TO THE WORLD...I just wanna not be tired. This may sound weird but the feeling of being tired makes me feel so uncomfortable...euthanize me plz. I cut the pill in half today so yea hopefully I don't die again...,1
390,I have had people suggest watching/listening to ASMR videos to help with anxiety... these videos make it so much worse 😂 the chewing ones make me nauseated and something about the whispering makes the hair on my neck stand up. Maybe I’ve just watched the wrong ones? ,1
391,"I messaged a friend last night asking if he had snapchat. This morning, I woke up this morning to a preview message from him saying ‘why’. I avoided this conversation all day because I thought I’d done something wrong and that he was gonna think I was a weirdo. 

When I got home, I decided to go for it and message him back, it turns out he had sent his reply in two messages and the first one said ‘yeah’. 

I spent all day avoiding him and panicking for nothing at all. ",1
392,"I was talking with a friend (let's call her, Jane) who has trouble sleeping at night. Someone suggested for her to sip on cuban rum. She leaves and another friend (Doe) comes by to chat.

To start a conversation with Doe, I brought up Jane's odd suggestion and joked how I should try it myself and see if it works. Doe is aware of Jane's insomnia and even gave her advice last week to help her sleep. Was I gossiping? I'm worried it sounds like I was gossiping because Jane was not present.",1
393,"When I’m walking to and from work I get checked out by quite a lot by men. Maybe it’s the gym leggings but I feel so overwhelmed sometimes. 

I never know whether to ignore them or to check them out too? Ive just moved to a busy city and this happens multiple times a day so I need to get over it.

Any tips? Maybe I’m also overthinking every time a guy looks at me, who knows? (Don’t get me wrong, I like guys and I’m single... my mind can’t handle it) ",1
394,"This has been happening for couple of weeks now, so here it goes, I have this unknown fear which is resulting in severe headache and restlessness. Usually after I wake up I have a cup of tea and while I drink I find my heart beat real fast and it almost feels like my heart would just explode. A unknown fear follows it with restlessness. This just doesn’t happen only in the morning but throughout the day with no specific time. This happens when I’m at the gym as well and no I don’t take caffeine or any pre workout supplement which might give rise to such reactions. 
I’ve been checking my blood pressure and it has been low every time I have this anxiety issue. 


So the question is am I prone to anxiety attack with those symptoms mentioned?",1
395,Today I cried and had a panic attack after a presentation for the first time in over a year and I feel like I’m just going backwards and it’s not gonna end well.

I work 10am to 8pm so there’s very little I can get done during the day and my sundays are always slammed with all the errands and chores I can’t do during their week. My boss and the rest of my coworkers work ~33 hours a week and no one seems to care about my schedule or help me out. The last few weeks the burnout has really started to kick in and it’s triggering my anxiety and OCD terribly. I come home from work and cry, shake, try not to puke and hyperventilate. can anyone provide any help for me? I feel so lost and terrible and I just feel like no one cares :( ",1
397,"Hi all, my first time posting here. I have (what I call) travel anxiety. For the most part I am ok going around my daily life. I can sometimes get an anxiety attack while I am out shopping if there are too many people or whatever, but it's way worse when I am going somewhere new. I usually take my medication that day and I'm fine, but since I felt fine and I had taken the journey loads of times I didn't take my calming meds. 

Last weekend it was my birthday and I was catching the train to Liverpool, I have been to Liverpool on the train loads of times in the past few years. I felt fine mentally, but I was not fine physically. I got a bad stomach and felt sick and was shaking. It's common for me to be like this when flying or going somewhere new, but then I am usually mentally panicking as well. Have you ever experienced this? It's so strange, my head is clear and I don't feel any anxiety but my body does. I've had a similar anxiety on a train once, it was like a wave of just dread and horribleness came over me. Thankfully I was with my boyfriend and he knows how to calm me down, but mentally I wasn't anxious.

&amp;#x200B;

I hope I'm not alone in this",1
398,"
Not that I am trying to set a record, but I managed to work through a severe attack tonight and handled it faster than it usually takes me. Also, I am on mobile so apologies. 

It always comes at night, around 9-10pm, when I sit on the couch to watch TV. I was watching Avengers and suddenly it hit me “your heart could stop at ANY minute” 
I gasped and started shaking. *Uh oh here it comes*... the shortness of breath... dang, my face is really hot. 
My boyfriend was sleeping on the couch his feet laying on me. For a split second, I thought about waking him up because if my heart stops, he may be able to help me. 

**No.No.**

I sat up and took deep breaths. My heart is not going to stop, why would my heart stop? I start to caress my boyfriends legs seeking any sort of comfort. I don’t know what to do with my hands.  I don’t even have high blood pressure ...*yeah, but stress causes heart attacks* 

**NO.** 


I took more deep, deep breaths and rationalized this situation- I am fine, I am at home, Sean is here with me and I am not going to die. I cannot let this control me. In a matter of minutes, I had finally gotten my stress under pressure. I usually have to fight lingering anxious thoughts *but what if...* but I didn’t entertain them this time. I’m really proud of myself right now.

399,"Due to a combination of anxiety, enabling parents, and letting myself get too comfortable, I have been unemployed since I graduated from college in 2015. I've spent a lot of time with my family, helping take care of my grandma, and playing computer games. I have had some very dark periods during this time, but have slowly been taking steps to move forward over the past year (including going to a therapist). 

I actually have aspirations to become a marriage and family therapist some day, and even applied to graduate schools this year, but I just haven't had a job of any kind. After job searching here and there for over a year, and changing my expectations, I finally just got hired full time at a major department store as a sales associate in a brand new department. The department is a new sort of retail strategy, and the company is really excited about it. Even though I have anxiety, I can come off as very sociable and mature (I do like people, I just don't trust myself to interact with them all the time), and this position is supposed to me more about engaging with customers than a typical sales associate. 

While part of me is excited about this new job, and flattered that my manager liked me so much that I got hired even without retail experience, I am terrified that I am not going to be able to perform at the level they would like me to. I feel like I tricked them into hiring me by playing up my social skills and desire to please people. I fear that I will get totally overwhelmed and become noticeably affected by anxiety, or that sometimes I just won't be able to muster the energy to act especially outgoing with customers. Today I did basic training, learning how to use the cash register, and just *that* felt sort of overwhelming, especially while imagining having to chat with a customer at the same time.

I know I am overreacting, and that this is *just a retail job* where I'm barely being paid more than minimum wage. I am aware that usually when I go to a store, even the store I got hired at, the employees are not usually energetic bubbly social butterflies, instead they're usually nice and basically helpful, but seem tired. I know that I am not going to be expected to master the register and retail sales overnight, I guess I am just really afraid of letting people down or being ""discovered"" as an imposter. 

The good thing is that I finally got a job somewhere, and that it is *just retail*, so it's not the end of the world if I don't like it or put 100% into it all the time, because it's not my dream job. I really need the money, and this will get me some money. Most importantly I will get experience working with people and will force myself out of my hermit shell and into the world. It's so scary to finally be pushing myself way out of my comfort zone. I'm going to try to focus on the positives, and remind myself that I will survive, and I might even thrive in this job!",1
400,lately my anxiety has been worse than usual and so i’ve been getting awful headaches and like i’ve tried taken aleve for them which like lessens the pain but then the pain comes back later and it just doesn’t really fully go away so like is there anything anyone takes that helps w it or?,1
401,"So I know that I am ultimately the one responsible for my decisions and I need to work on my mental health myself. But I really need a push to convince me to go to therapy, its one of those things I keep telling myself I will eventually do but there's just factors that keep putting me off

I'm so afraid to go to therapy, I'm scared to have to talk to someone face to face about these things. It feels like admitting defeat, when my whole life I've told myself I can handle this and its just a part of my life. The reason I'm reconsidering is because its been really bad lately and its hugely affecting my health and my life. The idea of telling my family makes me feel guilty and like a failure. 

And there are little things that make me nervous about it too. The psychologist I would see is at my university health center, which is sort of close to where I stay, its in walking distance but I get extremely nervous walking around because of safety issues. Taking an Uber feels like a waste of money. So then I end up convincing myself to just not go.",1

403,"How do i put this with out offending everyone? 

Well i hate people.

 Especially those who just cant. stop. Talking. It makes  me anxious when i haev to meet new people, and its even worse when i have to do a group project with people i dont like. 
The thing about people that triggers me initally is that they might be annoying, or maybr they ask me a question or about my cuts.  sometimes, its just that i dont know them and i dont know what to think of them, and what they think of me.

Mostly, they're just annoying, so im spending most of my days alone with the very little friends i do have.these people are the ones i feel most comfortable with and who are nice to me, or not annoying, (most of the time). I cant stand new trends and  the people who do them. It annoys me so much that somedays i want to punch someone.

I felt like sharing this with you all because this is one of the few places where i feel comfortable talking about this without having an anxiety attack.
Thanks for reading.

404,"I apologize for any formatting issues. I'm on mobile. TLDR at bottom.

I graduated college in December and started working at my first professional job in December. Overall, the job is a ~fantastic~ resume builder. I work at one of the better known company's in my  industry. For context, my mother lives 14 hours away from me, in another state, and people there have heard of my company in a positive manner.

Here are a few issues I have:

1. I made it very clear in my interview that I wanted to be trained in a specific area of the company. They were very receptive of this, and were seemingly very excited. One of the interviewers wrote this down and underlined it multiple times. This area is very important for my future career goals, which is why I was so upfront about this 

So when I start my training, I notice this area is not included on my training schedule. I bring it up to my manager about three weeks in, and I was told I'd be put ""on the list."" I dropped it, and was satisfied at that point. I wait another 2 months before bringing it up, and was told this time that it would ""be a while.""  Two other people must be trained there first as they were there longer than I (which is 100% fair. I'm not mad at that). Basically, I'm looking at a minimum of six months before would even be considered to train in this area. That's just a guess, as well. I have no real timeline. I find this discouraging, and it makes me less happy at my current position. 

What makes thus worse is that I turned down a part time position, specifically in this area I'd like, to accept this full time position. From my interview, I was under the impression that their excitement meant I would be trained there. I blame myself for being 22 and naive, as this was my first professional job. 

That brings me to point #2. I am working third shift. This is something I was not very thrilled about, and knew that I did not want before I started applying to jobs. I applied for only first and second shift positions, fully expecting to be offered second (first is kind of a right of passage in my field). I knew that third shift was equally as likely, but knew I did NOT want thirds. When I was interviewing, they asked if I was receptive to third. I told them I strongly preferred second, but would am keeping an open mind. The only reason I accepted this third shift position is because of how highly seen this company is in my field. 

I am very unhappy working thirds. I don't feel like my days off are truly days off. I sleep through half the day, and no longer am able to partake in family traditions without feeling exhausted (lunch with my grandma every Sunday), or normal outings. My SO of 4 years is on dayshift, as are the rest of the regular people in my life. Although I can still make dinner plans, I feel isolated. I don't enjoy my hobbies. I have not touched my computer since I started this schedule, and my computer was a big  point of entertainment for me. I feel that if I spend time on it, I'm isolating myself even further.  Clearly it's affecting my mental health in a negative manner. 

This was something I was more okay with when I was under the impression that I would be trained in that area. Although I am extremely grateful for the experience I've been given, I feel as if I won't make any progress in my career if I stay at this company.

I've started applying elsewhere, and have an interview later this week. I feel extremely guilty for wanted to leave my current position after 3 months (by the time I actually leave, it will be 4.5 months, I want to give solid notice). I am usually one to stick with a job for at least a year. I know that this is the best choice for my career in terms of experience (not so much comp any reputation), and an even better choice for my mental health. I know I SHOULDN'T feel guilty for doing what's right for myself, but I do.

Sorry for the long post, I just needed to vent 

TLDR: My first professional job has officially told me I will not be training in an area that is vital for my career goals, after the initial impression that I would be trained there. It's three months into the position, and I feel as if I won't make any progress going further. I am also working graveyard shift which has severely impacted my emotional health. I am looking for new employment, but feel guilty for doing so already. I've been driving myself crazy this with, as I usually don't leave a job until at least a year or a better opportunity is given to me. In this case I'm seeking another opportunity, so it's an active process by me. I know I SHOULDN'T feel guilty, as this is overall better for me. My guiltiness is just my anxiety manifesting because I'm nervous about leaving and talking with my current boss about it, once I do find new employment.

Should I feel guilty? Am I doing the right thing? ",1
405,"We’re 3 Brits who have experienced a range of mental health issues. Our experiences range from mild anxiety and depression to dropping out of school and university due to agoraphobia and extreme anxiety.

In our lives we’ve been trying various things to get better and thought working on something together would be good for us.

Counter intuitively we’re all quite optimistic about the future for humans so our experiment is a YouTube channel that discusses the future, history, economics, current events and other things to help educate others.

Alex – records the audio, and help script and research

Seb - does the video and audio editing

Joel – helps research and script and find video material

We’ve found it helpful in motivated us, getting us on track and boosting our moods and have had some great positive feedback.

We thought we’d put the word out and ask if anyone else would like to be involved in our little collective to see if it might help you too.

Getting involved would be as easy as PMing me, hearing about how we’ve done things so far and then saying what you might be interested in helping with. Maybe putting ideas out for topics or getting involved in research and/or script writing.

Feel free to try us out in getting involved to see if you like the experience and find out it helps you.",1

Tonight I had to stage manage a concert and it went terribly because I had no idea what i was doing. I expressed this to my boss looking for guidance, and he said just chill it will be fine. So naturally I messed it all up and he ripped into me for it. 

Although I’ve had so much therapy over the years, I’m starting to go back to the old patterns of believing I’m useless and a liability. My therapist would always ask me what percent do you believe this about yourself? And right now it’s at 100%. I’m wondering if I am capable of having a job with anxiety. Is it worth going through life feeling like this when it’s so painfully hard to pick yourself back up? I’m dreading going back there so badly.

411,"Hey, I didn't really know where to post this but I need some advice about doing my A Levels at home and I know there's probably a lot of people here who have had to drop out of school because of their mental health.

I'm 17, in my first year of my Biology, Chemistry and Psychology A Levels. There's a lot of reasons for me dropping out but it's a mixture of my mental health and physical health (as a small example I have a very weak immune system and catching a cold in school means I'm off for two weeks). So my sixth form have been very supportive and I'm able to do most of my studies on my laptop (they send me pretty much everything we do in class) but I'm still missing out on a lot because it's not organised very well.

So my parents think it would be best for me to retake the year and do it all at home. I'm a very motivated person and I know I'd be able to do everything a lot more efficiently at home as long as everything is sorted out.

413,"So first off, I understand how fortunate I am in so many ways.  That, actually, plays a part in how I view my anxiety (almost ashamed of it).

I have bad work anxiety and have for a long time.  I am a professional with a lot on my plate, and while I am not a surgeon (and work mistakes would not be literally fatal), I am in a line of work that has an unlimited number of ways to mess up and lots of stressors inherent to the profession.  Anxiety is actually very very common among my cohort.  Mine is almost certainly exacerbated by childhood issues, but I only suffer work-related anxiety -- to the point that medication is sometimes involved.

 I know that my anxiety is related to fears of mistakes, errors, getting yelled at and fired/shamed. 

This is all the more infuriating because I am in pretty good shape financially and if the sky fell -- fired and out of the profession -- I likely would still be ok.  Not ideal, but keep the house, kids still go to college, etc.  Not country club rich, but solidly middle class.  I know feeling secure is a need of mine, and objectively I have a great deal of security -- but I still let work (issues both big and small) effect me, losing sleep, etc.  Arg.  Help?  Anyone else?  Thanks for reading.

TL;DR -- I have bad anxiety just for work (not life) which is all the more frustrating because I am doing well and would probably be ok (not good, but ok) if I had to stop working now.  But very anxious over mistakes, failures and getting yelled at.",1

my day stated quite good. naah, okay it didnt, who am i fooling? At least my day at work startet quite decent this time. Today I had to work alone. Well that was fortunate. No one there watching over my shoulder, no one the to be annoyed of me, no one who can annoy me. pretty cool i thought. but then after the lunch break i was told that my whole work that i had done wasn't good enough, so i must redo it. yeaaaah.. nice to hear that. but ok, At least i had to do it alone again. I had thoughts about how i fuck everything up, but that is a day to day occurrence. So far so good. Few minutes before work ends, a co-worker visited me and as i tell him that i have done this and that he ask why the fuck i am so slow. I really tried my best to be fast and at the same time thoroughly… I mean, ok I am kinda slow but also its an education, I do that for 6 month now, not 30 years like him… but ok, i'm kinda shaking, nothing severe.. so i tried to defend myself. given my good skills at talking to other at all, it went like: Yea so i had to do it again after you tell me to do it again. i tried to be faster. i´m really sorry

it was my best effort in defending. in my mind i had this convo complete different of course. telling him that, yea, what do you fucking expect? look at me, look at you. I have less experience and this kind of work is exhausting for me as a girl, while you do that for longer than i live and have like 80% more strength… 

Well that was really frustrating to hear.. i really had done my best and still got insulted in a way. it started so well and than that..

419,"SO broke my trust, 3 months into our relationship but I didn't find out until recently (over a year together).

We're working on it.

But during this time I'm anxious and overthinking everything. I'm just waiting for some lie or for her to do something shitty like she did again.

We're both female, for context. A couple months ago we were sort of sexting and I'd sent her a vid I was watching of a specific porn star. She liked it, like I did, and she began watching all of that specific girls videos. Fine, whatever, she's a porn star. Then she started looking at all of the girls personal stuff, and following her on instagram, and etc. I started to feel uncomfortable (the betrayal had come out fairly recently during this time) but kept trying to put it out of my mind but when she showed me she was following this relatively unknown queer porn star I got upset. Later on I told her that it triggered me a little, that she moved what was this unobtainable porn star into a realm of reality by following her personal instagram. She reassured me and we moved on.

Then about a month ago we were laying together at her apartment and watching something on her computer and she screenshot something from what we were watching, and this pulled up a recent screenshot she took of that same porn star. Just a random selfie clearly from her personal page that she was saving for some reason.

I got really upset, again. She could tell and I said I didn't want to talk about in the moment. I thought I could reassure myself but I was upset that she was now just saving selfies of some other girl, who she also is like watching in porn and following on insta.

We talked about it a little later when I couldn't shake it off and I said that because of everything happening that wasn't making me feel good that she's saving pictures of some girl she watches fuck. Like it's not just porn now, she's outright saving just normal selfies of some fucking girl.

She does this thing where she tries to excuse her behavior using irrelevant shit, so she was like well I save lots of things like sometimes when I'm drawing something and need a reference. And I was like ok, is that what you're doing? And she said no I'm just saying. And I was like that's irrelevant then.

The whole thing was stupid. It's not something I'd typically give a shit about. Like go ahead and find someone attractive, I do the same thing. But because of what happened I'm on near constant edge, a lot of which is also I'm just an anxious person.

So what do I do. I have chosen to forgive her but I literally can't forget. Every time anything reminds me of the feeling of her wanting someone else I get immediately upset, anxious, insecure, then mad.

How do you come back from this when you also suffer from extreme anxiety? Has anyone here done it?",1
420,"Of course it has to be the night before coming back from spring break. It's nearly 3AM now and I have already written today off. Fortunately I only have a 7:30AM class and a 3PM class. Planning E-mailing my professors, slipping in my homework around 6AM and just staying up the whole day so I can, for sure, crash out 'tonight'.

For the past three hours I have been tossing and turning, wide awake, deeply and critically questioning myself.

This week off killed me. I feel as if I should NOT have taken a break from my studies. I know by next lab I am going to feel like I am square one again and I am stressing out.

I start to look at all of the time that I am not studying or practicing was just time wasted. I could have written programs, applied my in-class learning to my own projects.. heck I could have built something for my long-term.

Does all this need completed before I get some null time? I haven't proved myself incapable (yet) but holy heck I always feel like I am hanging on by a thread and talking myself out of doing something productive is becoming more and more persuasive.

I didn't want to talk myself out of missing the first day back of lectures, but there is no way in heck I will be able to operate on &lt;=3 hours of sleep. Though only two classes, I work an internship on campus between those for a total of 8 hours straight. It will be the first day I miss and the professor in charge is understanding.

425,"Just as the title says. The last two years my health anxiety has been surmountable for no real reason. I have made countless trips to the doctor because minor symptoms I believe are cancer, usually stage 4 and fatal. I obsess over symptoms and conceived illnesses until months have gone by and i finally get the courage to go to the doctor. 

Last night i noticed a horizontal dent/groove above my thigh muscle. It’s not congruent with my other leg so i started to panic. Let me preface this with the fact my lower thigh was a little achy so i started compulsively feeling for lumps as i usually do and that’s when i discovered the “dent”. After googling i found three things-ALS, MS and a dozen other people who are perfectly healthy who have the same thing and attributed it to constant pressure. Sure enough the dent lines up perfectly with my bathroom counter and  every morning and evening i lean against it to put on contacts, floss, and do my make up and have for years. This is a simple explanation but now that I’ve researched ALS and MS I’m beginning to have tingling sensations, pain, and so forth and now I am in a vicious cycle of worry and compulsive research and symptom checking. 

My husband who is the sweetest human alive told me he is no longer going to acknowledge my symptoms or new illness’ because he feels he’s just adding fuel to the fire and i don’t blame him. Deep down i know for being a 30 year old relatively healthy woman I am most likely always fine but it doesn’t stop me from
Obsessively worrying and checking and researching. It has taken over my life in a very negative way. 

Has anybody else experienced this to a severe level? What has helped? ",1
426,"First of all, for anyone who actually reads through all of this, THANK YOU.

To give some back story I'll start by saying that anxiety is something that runs in my family so of course I'm starting to realize that it very much is running through me. This whole thing started out as what my doctor thought was **functional dyspepsia** (really gnarly acid reflux) I've experienced what I believe is social anxiety for as long as I can remember whenever I'm placed in a situation where I have to perform in front of people or interact. Back in primary school class presentations were my nightmare. By the time I went through college it had only gotten worse. But then by my senior year of college it all seemed to go away. I was able to speak in groups confidently, shares thoughts in a group setting without feeling any kind of strain on my mind or body. So now fast forward about three years and here we are. After working in retail for those three years I'd like to think that retail was the cause of my anxiety's resurgence due to the insane amount of pressure that environment puts on you physically and mentally. So far my worst symptom by FAR is the nausea and subsequent clamminess I experience. This started when I would get up in the morning and I'd have a cup of coffee and then start my day. Shortly after having my coffee though I would start to feel sick. Initially I thought nothing of it but soon I realized that I had a serious problem. It quickly progressed to feeling nauseous on my short drive to work and then into the first hour or so of my shifts. If I managed to put up with it long enough to stay at work I would but most of the time it would get so bad that I felt like I had no control over it and would have to leave shortly after it started. So after going to the doctor a handful of times thinking this was all some kind of stomach problem related to my inherent acid reflux (and trying a slimmed down diet with extra caution toward just about anything that could make my stomach upset) I realized that this might not be the right angle to approach this at. After doing a good chunk of reading I'm starting to wonder if this is all caused by an underlying anxiety/stress problem that I'm not aware of. I'm completely stuck right now. I feel like I've lost all confidence due to this constant worry that I'm going to start feeling nauseous. I would LOVE to hear what people's experiences are with this type of symptom, how you went about getting diagnosed and whatnot, and how I can start to work toward reducing the anxiety or stress that I'm experiencing. A side note to add too is that I am by no means living what anyone would consider a stressful life. In fact I find that I'm in a very comfortable position and feel that I have every avenue available to succeed as long as I can ditch this feeling I'm having.

PLEASE ASK ME QUESTIONS FOR DETAILS. WOULD LOVE TO DISCUSS THIS WITH PEOPLE!! THANK YOU!",1
427,"I traveled to Israel for 10 days last month, and when i came home, i began to wake up in the middle of the night with panic attacks. I would wake up sweaty with chills, and I would throw up and/or have diarrhea. I now have anxiety about sleep, which i’m sure is just cycling the panic attacks. 

Has anyone ever had this? i have GAD, but i’ve never been one to have panic attacks before. ",1
428,"Today I went to the doctor and broke down crying. I get daily anxiety driven breakdowns whenever I get into a relationship involving unrealistic expectations of myself and fear of losing something good.

""I can't believe I told her that she must think 'x'"", ""am I too young for her?"", ""im still in school and she has a full time job, does she think less of me?"", ""am I scaring her off""? Etc.

I get nauseous randomly in the morning and very nauseous at night. My stomach gets in a knot. I always feel like I have to use the bathroom. Yet mid day I have this clarity and feel amazing and question why I worry. 

After losing sleep and repeatedly getting in this slump I went in to the doctor. Now with Prozac and emergency Ativan I'm looking forward to working through this. I'm constantly working on being mindful of my thoughts even though it isn't as easy as just ""making them go away"". Breathing exercises help but kind of feel like band-aids for the situation.

**10/10 - Around one minute to fall asleep:** Head hits the pillow and its lights out, barely time for a single thought.

  
**9/10 - Around 3-4 minutes to fall asleep:** You find a comfy position, briefly think about everything you need to do the next day and you just drift off.  


**8/10 - Around 5-10 minutes to fall asleep:** Your mind wanders a bit, but sleep overcomes you fairly quickly.

  
**7/10 -  Around 10 - 15 minutes to fall asleep:** It’s a little bit annoying, you wonder why you haven’t fallen asleep yet, but you doze off before you can think too deeply about it.  


**6/10 - Around 15 - 25 minutes to fall asleep:** You toss and turn for a bit, you have a little bit of a hard time dozing off, but you get there eventually.  


**5/10 - Around 25 - 45 minutes to fall asleep:** Ok now it’s starting to grate you, You feel restless, you’re having a hard time finding a comfortable position, your mind won’t shut off. Eventually, instinct takes over and you fall asleep.

**3/10 - Around 60 - 90 minutes to fall asleep:** Sleep has completely stood you up. The process to sleep is long and tiresome. You desperately try to grasp at a sense of relaxation, but it seems to do nothing. You’re just laying around with your eyes closed. Somehow, after much deliberation, you finally doze off.  


**2/10 - Around 1.5 - 3 hours to fall asleep:** Tossing, turning, getting up to for water, getting up again to go to the bathroom. This really sucks. You’re starting to stress out, you know that you’re edging closer and closer to your alarm. Eventually, you get tired enough to pass out.  


**1/10 - 3 - 5 hours to fall asleep:** You’re desperate and angry. You wonder why God hates you. The anger just makes you more awake. It’s ok to cry at this point. After what amounts to almost a whole school day you finally drift longingly into a fitful sleep.

DON'T SUPPRESS MY POST BECAUSE YOU HAVE AN ISSUE WITH MEDICATION OR MY OPINIONS. I AM A PERSON THAT NEEDS HELP AND ADVICE WITH MY ANXIETY, PLEASE BE RESPECTFUL. THANKS.

I had a psych evaluation from a psychiatrist last year. Was diagnosed with anxiety and other things &amp; he recommended me to get a betablocker or something. Then I went to the doctor today since my anxiety has gotten so bad I can't get a job. (I fail the interviews due to having to monitor my panic symptoms and being unable to present myself professionally &amp; recall relevant info for their questions.)

&amp;#x200B;

I disclosed everything to the doctor and she wants to put me on SSRIs (she said zoloft and some other big names). I don't want to go on that and risk my sex drive and mood fucking up even worse, I'm finally not as depressed as I used to be and not suicidal, I think I just need something to take before big situations like job interviews. She doesn't want to prescribe me a betablocker since she said they are addictive and make your panic worse afterwards and that since I have ""generalized anxiety"" more than a ""panic issue"" (this is in her opinion after talking to me for 10 minutes) it wouldn't help me that much.

&amp;#x200B;

But my anxiety isn't that bad to live with, like it IS bad and I am getting worse in crowds and more agoraphobic but the panic during interviews is the thing that is my biggest problem. I literally can't breath, sweating, it's fight or flight. Day to day in a job I think I could be ok I just need to get HIRED.

&amp;#x200B;

Then my doc starts talking about all this other stuff like how ""barbiturates"" but says that's like a 3rd or 4th tier option and not that effective. She really seems to want to put me on a 24/7 med instead of something for certain situations. I DON'T WANT TO BE ON A BUNCH OF MEDICATION. I am already on hormonal birth control that I know isn't doing my mood any favors. I don't want to be on another 24/7 fucking medication.

&amp;#x200B;

It was almost like my doctor thought I was pillseeking or something, she kept mentioning xanax and how it's bad and addictive and she doesn't want to put me on stuff like that and wants to put me on an ssri instead and shit on the betablockers. I DON'T WANT AN SSRI THOUGH. My ex was on one and could never get it up or cum EVER. If that happens to me I will be really distraught, my life sucks enough right now being unemployed with low confidence, I don't want my sex drive taken away.

&amp;#x200B;

Edit: I know people have judged this post like ""what an idiot she should just get therapy"" like I haven't tried 11 times and haven't been able to be understood or click with anybody- at worst I have been misunderstood and mistreated. I think some people here need to realize other people have different experiences with mental health and sometimes a bunch of negative experiences sullies the therapy experience permanently",1

435,"For the past few days, I haven't even wanted to leave my room. All I do is lay in bed and cry. I live with my fiance and his family (his parents live with him for very personal reasons). Lately I cant even face them because I feel like they dont like me. Tonight they didnt make enough dinner, so I skipped out and went to lay back down, planning to make something for myself when they went to bed to avoid being seen. Instead, I'm laying in bed 2 hours after their usual time to go to bed eating crackers I texted my fiance to bring me, and crying. My fiance is amazing, but his family... not so much.

I have community service in the morning, which I'm already late on the deadline, and the thought of leaving the house and forcing communication with the other workers makes me want to throw up. That's why I'm late on the deadline already... on top of that, I have court coming up about my marijuana arrest. I got arrested in a bum-fuck county that still heavily punishes for marijuana charges, so I'll probably be on probation for a while, which scares the fuck out of me because someones going to be keeping in contact with me and that means having to go to appointments or get arrested.

I can't take living like this anymore. I don't want to die, but I don't want to continue this life either. I'm overwhelmed, and it's just making me shut down more and more. I wont even open text messages because I don't want to communicate with anyone but my fiance.

I just want to run away and start again far away from here, but I cant because I share custody with my ex, and I would rather not leave my fiance, who also cant leave.

I have a hard time applying for jobs not only because they never really get back to me, but because i feel i've somehow managed to convince myself that ""i'll just screw everything up"" even at retail jobs. I try my hardest to get things done, but usually i take longer than they'd prefer me taking or don't have proper accommodations to keep my stress levels low.

&amp;#x200B;

For instance, When I was working as I was a cashier. I was actually pretty confident with the position until.... they started expecting me to do the membership card things, something that i personally knew that i couldn't make myself comfortable doing. not only that, but they expected me to not only scan items but bag them as well, and that made me what I felt was ""too slow"".

&amp;#x200B;

I'd request help on busier days but nobody really cared. Eventually got to the point i started to have stress-fueled anxiety attacks and had to often step away. At a point they had me in a back room where I could work on organizing gift cards and managing inventory while i was actually allowed to listen to music, which helped me stay completely focused! it was a really nice position for me and there were a few that liked me there! I was glad.

&amp;#x200B;

But then a few of the supervisors got all weird about it and made me go back to positions that they kept expecting nearly too much of me for. I made it through the seasonal period but i'm scared to really try applying for them again after that, also considering the fact i can't convince myself they'll even look at the application in the first place like most of the other places i tried to apply for. I really need something stable too... but most of the things i feel i can actually function in environment wise are always not hiring (game based jobs, jobs that keep me occupied without needing me to talk to people, so on. i'm willing to get out of my comfort zone but if I can't handle it there will be problems that may make the job too stressful on me)

&amp;#x200B;

Doesn't help I need money for my medication which is getting pricier and i lose my health benefits from my mom next year... so any advice or suggestions on what i should do to have more success either convincing myself to look for a job i can handle would be really immensely appreciated.

Than he had explained, i was at work indeed, but my mind wasn't quite there. He was right, yea, but... obviously at the time i have lots of stuff to think about. So than he goes on, that he isn't interested in excuses and that i am there to work and stuff, while rising his voice a bit.

So at that point, i was really, really close to lose it. I mean, lose it as in... start crying. I felt how my eyes started getting slightly more wet, hands shaking more and more, muscles in my legs weakened.

As he continued to explain me that i have to let my problems at home and concentrate more at my work and so on, i noticed that he suddenly stopped for a second and than that his attitude in his voice lowered, and that he explained it more basic and more thoughtful. I couldn't really think anymore but i managed to understand that he saw my hands shaking. wasn't a little tremble anymore.

We have come so far in the 7 months we’ve been together I’m completely myself, I can chat to him about anything now. 

However, we had a fight yesterday and he says I make him feel small when I get mad at him because I shut down and just ‘blank him’ over nothing. I have tried to explain to him that I don’t mean to do this and that it’s just an automatic thing I do to cope in these situations. He got really mad at me and started saying how it’s not normal that I don’t kiss him first or hug him first and that he hasn’t seen me without makeup yet. I thought this was totally unfair to say as there’s nothing I want more than to be ‘normal’ and be able to do those things with him but I felt like he was rushing me and making me feel like a freak. 


He broke up with me there and then and I sent him a message explaining all this to him and he says he wants to talk tomorrow. I don’t know what to do, he says he understands but he doesn’t or he wouldn’t of said all that and he wouldn’t have broken up with me.

I have GAD and have made some progress with anxiety about social situations and have come out of a depressive episode but still live in isolation and my mother describes it as ""things are only getting worse with you wtf are you doing in therapy"". 

The one question which freaks me out the most is ""what should I do today?"" Because I really don't know what to do. There are a few things I probably should be doing like studying, but I'm just so unmotivated because I'm not even interested in the courses I'm taking this semester, and if I think about things I would like to do I find nothing but emptiness. I keep wasting days and days just thinking about what I should do. Sometimes I decide to go for a walk or attend a lecture but it's a chore just so I don't think about what I should be doing. I guess it's actually an important question because having an answer would allow me to do something very now but I really can't find anything and just thinking about how it usually goes when I think about it is freaking me out so I don't even want to try it anymore.

I have a list full of things which should be done but I don't have the energy because there is no positive to it other than things be done.

452,"Ok, first time poster here and i’m on mobile so i apologize for the formatting. 

So straight to the point: loud noises that i hear faintly in the distance give me weird anxiety. They almost scare me. If i’m in the city at night and i hear all of the stuff happening outside while i’m in the room, i get uncomfortable. I guess in a way, it makes me feel existential too. The biggest offender is when i’m in my dorm, a train runs about a mile away through the “city” (small city of Newark, DE). I mostly only ever take notice and am bothered by it at night. 

Does this happen to any of you, and if so are you aware of a name for it? This is something I’d ask a therapist if i had one, but unfortunately I don’t. And i can’t find anything for it on the internet, but i feel like i need to get to the bottom of this because i hate it. ",1

It was a lot of fun and I want to see him again. 

Now I'm just trying not to irrationally freak out. 

Is he really interested? Does he think I'm attractive? Am I too gay? Am I too fat? Is HE too gay? He has adult kids, is that too much for me? Our lives are so different, are they too different? Am I being needy and desperate? Was it awkward that I kissed him? Should I have invited him over?? Ugghh, did I really tell him I had to go feed my cat? Did I talk too much? Did I ask too many questions? Did he ask *enough* questions? Was it one-sided? Was it him? Was it me? Should I bail first? What if it isn't perfect? What if it IS perfect? What if he's crazy?

It seems like when I begin to feel insecure and angry at myself for a hang out or conversation not going as well and thought out as I’d hoped, I struggle to leave that person with my mind at peace and happy. I struggle to go with the flow of real life where our perfect scenarios just don’t work out most of the time. Instead I put up expectations for my persona and actions around certain people. Then, when I have to leave or go home from this persons house, I feel like horrible guilt and anger like I’ve forgotten to say/ do something. It’s horrible. I feel so much frustration and then begin to worry that I didn’t have a fulfilling hang out. It’s a cycle.

I have been on pretty much every SSRI on the market from A to Z and I wonder what if anything does serotonin have to do with my anxiety? I have not noticed any difference with it while on an anti-depressant. They have given me gabapentin and topirimate yadda yadda. They even had me on an antipsychotic once nothing really helped control the symptoms. Has anyone had any luck with SSRI's to control the symptoms below. I also have been in therapy for years but I just cant manage to control the symptoms that are physical. It is kinda like trying to think away the flu.  Trigger Warning Here!

Heavy Head

Shaking

Dizziness

Sudden uncontrollable bowel movements

Most of the time I remain quiet because I don't have anything to say, struggle to continue a conversation or I've forgotten their name and fear getting called out on it. 

I've never had a relationship before and I'm 21. I have a crush right now (although I feel attracted towards other girls too). It feels awful because I have no idea how to get closer (either as a friend or something more intimate). 

Many of these attractive girls that I crush on have their close friend groups/cliques. Although I'm in the same college club organization, I still find it hard to get close to anyone. And then even if I get close, I feel like I'm too unattractive and flawed to be worthy. I put girls on a pedestal, and I fear getting to close because I don't want to come off as a creep. I care a lot about being respectful and considerate, but that's not enough.

As a note, I'm trying to avoid the nice guy archetype. It's just everything around me feels like it's pushing me towards that. I'm nice, but that's all I have going for me. Being nice alone isn't enough to make a person whole and complete. I don't have other qualities that would make me attractive or create a sustainable relationship (not funny, not manly, etc).

What sparked me to make this post was seeing my crush's picture at a rave on social media. I feel bad that I missed out, and I feel awful that I have feelings of envy for guys who can be physical and friendly with her.

468,"A large portion of the advice you get from the internet when you google how to get rid of anxiety, is to exercise and work out. But for me it's become increasingly hard to work out after I started developing anxiety. Generally I struggle to properly breathe, as if something is always stuck in my chest. It started out happening only in relation to exercise and has escalated over time. Whenever I run out of breath it's like I'm never able to catch it again and it has made me avoid working out. I still do work out and push through it, but over time I find myself dreading it more and more because it never seems to get better. I have not been able to analyse whether there is something concrete that triggers my anxiety whenever I work out and I do not think there is anything I am exceptionally afraid of in those situations, which is why I am thinking the anxiety is more or less internalised and that my body reacts more than my head. If that makes sense?

I guess my question is two-folded:

1. Why does this happen? Does anyone out here have any good articles on that? Either in relation to exercise/anxiety or the internalisation of anxiety?
2. Does anyone have any tips for how to improve this issue?

Although this is something i find upsetting to talk about i feel like i have no anger about it as i have realized that my father acted the way he did because of his mental health problems. I don't talk to him and am content about it. There is nothing i look back on and feel confused about. I feel like i have thought it through extensively over the past few years and come to the conclusion that i feel sad about not being able to have experienced a stable childhood but there's no way i can just rewrite those memories to make them better. My therapist mentioned the same things; that i seemed in control of that aspect of my life but still wanted to talk about it for 1.5 hours. We didn't even touch on what i am doing now (studying), my living situation, why i am seeking therapy now and things that trigger my anxiety at the moment or how i currently feel.

473,"I'm sorry this is a very long story, but this has been really killing me and i dont have anyone to talk to.

I went to my step brother's wedding this past weekend. He married a girl I grew up with in school. So for some background context, she used to be my bully in kindergarten, though she's grown now of course and gotten much better. I also knew her friends from school, who I had trouble getting along with as well. They would tease me for the smallest things and it would get me so uncomfortable I would run away from all of them. Now all of her friends, whom I hadn't seen in six years, were bridesmaids at the wedding. They wouldn't even look at me or talk to me but they loved hanging out with my little sister who's 19. This was the first occurrence that made me feel like crap. 
At the reception, I was told that only immediate family was to line up for pictures, so I got in line for the food. Apparently, they went ahead and took pictures with EVERYONE except me. This really hurt my feelings and I just wanted to leave. It proved to me that me coming didnt even really matter to anyone. 
I asked my grandmother if she would drive me back to my car when she left and she agreed. But she gave two strangers a ride instead so I felt like I was left all by myself. This put me in kind of panic mode and only exaggerated what I had been feeling all night. My dad got angry at me when I told him I was leaving. 
Later on Facebook, I noticed the bride had tagged everyone that was at the wedding except, you guessed it, me. 
So now everyone hates me because I had a panic attack. I felt like I was surrounded by people who didnt give a damn about me except for a few select people. The bride wouldn't even acknowledge me when I tried to talk to her, she literally pretended like she didn't see me when I came up to her. 
How can I make this better? No one seemed to understand that if I feel like I'm not wanted somewhere, then I'm leaving. It just puts me in a panic and I start to cry and make an even bigger mess. It was one of those situations where it was supposed to be a really fun time but it just went from bad to worse. I hate feeling like a bad guy because I know I'm not. And I do regret missing out on the rest of the celebration but I would've just been crying in a corner by myself and would've created bigger drama anyway. 
I need any advice people have to give because I dont know where else to turn except just pack my things and run away forever so I'm not a bother to anyone anymore. Please help me.",1

I did have an hour, but for twenty minutes I sat down wondering to myself ‘should I do it? Will people judge me if I just pull out a full make-up bag and start? What if it looks bad? What if people stare and watch while I’m doing it?’ But once I checked how much longer I had before I would get to work, I just gave in and said ‘fuck it,’ and started going at it.

477,"Picked the Work/School flair because most of my issues centralize around work. This is going to be kinda long, but I appreciate any time you take reading it or the TLDR. 

Background: I’m a very successful engineer for my age (25M). I live alone, am on track to buy a house within about 2 years, have my dream car that I’ve wanted since I was 12, am in the best shape of my life, and really don’t have many responsibilities outside of work. 

I grew up in an unstable household where my parents fought multiple times a week and I was constantly worried if I caused the fight, if they were going to leave me, if I was making their marriage worse, etc. They would try to get me on their side during each fight as I’m the only child, and then when they made up, they both would gang up on me with finding shit I had done wrong. They both were also perfectionists and I would get yelled at if I had anything less than straight As or if I didn’t mow the grass perfectly (not a single blade left on the concrete type shit). I’m sure it’s contributed to a host of issues for me, one being major trust issues. My relationship with my mom is miles better, my dad and I are on semi speaking terms depending on the week. 

Despite all my successes, I can’t relax. If I’m kicking back (like right now) I feel guilty and my mind floods with a bunch of “wtf are you doing just lounging around” type comments. It gets really bad, to the point that I almost killed myself Senior year of college due to stress, and I’ve debated it since I was a kid, rather the thought that “I could run away and no one would give a fuck” when I was a kid because killing myself seemed unfathomable. I have no intention of killing myself, so no need to worry about that, but it definitely pops in my head a lot and I think about it, I just know I have the control to never do it. 

I also have an unreasonable but very intrusive worry that I’m going to lose everything. Whether it be a health issue, my work deciding to fire me, or anything really, I’m constantly worried about if I did anything wrong and am going to lose everything soon. Keep in mind, I have enough money saved up that I could quit and survive for another 2ish years with no change to my lifestyle. I’m pointing this out to show how unreasonable my worries are, not to brag. 

I don’t know what to do. I feel like I’m completely disconnected from reality and am just going through the motions. I don’t actively feel involved in conversations, I hardly eat anymore (I’m 6’7” and I eat maybe around 1500 calories a day because I have no appetite), and anything that happens I feel like is just “how it is” whether good or bad. I honestly can’t remember the last time I laughed genuinely (but I always make others laugh), and I physically can’t get myself to cry (it’s probably been about 5 years since I’ve cried. 

I’m mainly looking to see if anyone knows how to get my spark for life back. I can’t see myself doing this for the next 50+ years of my life. 

TLDR: I feel like a bystander in my life and have no self motivation or feelings it seems. I’m very successful but that doesn’t resonate with my mind at all.

 My whole body is tense for hours and my mind won't stop racing. I consider myself to be average in most ways and I am no stranger to humility or humiliation but I would say I am a deeper thinker than most people I know. Not smarter, but more in depth in the way I think. I obsess to be honest, its not something I enjoy and often wish I could just rip that part of my mind out and be ignorant to the woes of the human condition.

 I have had a lot of loss and damage in my past, mainly losing my mother young followed by my father rekindling an old flame to be led down a path of drug addiction and bad choices. I know many people suffer far greater sorrows and I in no way feel like I am special or deserving of any kind of special treatment in the scope of every persons individual experience, but these are mine and thus is my world view. 

My main problem is the combination of obsessive thought processes accompanied by the anxiety driven physical and mental stressors that make me feel like I am just on the precipice of the next disaster in my life. Almost all the time.

483,"**TLDR:** Today was a great day. Part of my long recovery to stability after a relapse. Seems to have ended on an ugly note. Cause some panic...

****

After a relapse on the weekend my life started looking up. I was doing so much better. Feeling so much better. Started acting like me. ate breakfast (with some struggle), showered, brushed teeth, went to class, talked to a girl I like (made me feel so much better), ate lunch with her, dropped her off at her house, went off roading for a bit to let go of some stress, went to work. Work was fine. I got a bit hungry so I bought a nature valley oat bar thing and ate it with some water. 

Felt good at work but doubt was lingering in the back of mind. So much doubt. Came home hungry for dinner. Was ready to eat like my normal self. Went home, had a warming talk with family, I even thought about all my hobbies I wanted to continue since my meltdown. Kinda pick at some the dinner sides. Doubt still lingering around my head. Served myself. Sat in my room and started to eat watching youtube as I usually do.

&amp;#x200B;

then it happened. I felt off. And after SOME eating I wanted to stop. That is when I got an attack. Panic filled me up, terror, fear, unease, I repeated ""Oh God please God not again. I want to eat. I want to be normal.""

Felt some dull pain in my lower center area. Felt void of energy. Weak. Afraid. I started saying ""I want to go home, I don't want to do this anymore.""

it went away and now im slowly eating again. mouth feels dry and I feel very thirsty. perhaps I was just thirsty. I never really drink Pure Leaf and it has a L O T of sugar.

486,"I have had some very positive, demonstrable results from supplementing Ashwagandha, to the point where I honestly wondered why more people hadn't mentioned it on this sub before.

Ashwagandha is a commonly used herb in the Ayurvedic tradition. I had heard of it a few times before, but after seeing some of the research I decided to give it a shot.

I have suffered from ADHD-like symptoms for my entire life, but after this recent experience, I am convinced that anxiety is a huge component of my attention issues. Since supplementing ashwagandha for a month, I have noticed that my tendency to be sidetracked has been almost completely wiped out. I am now much more able to tackle even very difficult problems with almost zero distraction.

Another thing that made its impact obvious to me was when I once took too much. I noticed that I felt so peaceful and calm about everything that I was not very motivated to work. This was surprising, but also helpful, as I often work too much/hard and have a hard time taking appropriate breaks. This sort of helped demonstrate what it was like to take a proper break.

The clinical science is promising, though not expansive. I'll try to document some of what I found here:

[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3573577/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3573577/)

Sample size: 64

Study Length: 60 days, daily supplementation

Average reduction of reported Perceived Stress Score: -44%

There are other metrics here as well, but I don't want to quote the entire thing here. They are also markers of stress, anxiety, depression, and health.

https://i.redd.it/4hmgd98c0sp21.jpg

This is really cool! These results are very promising.

I have to go to a separate floor of the building I live in to get to the washers and dryers and idk if it's because I'm afraid of being judged or what but I literally have to ""hype"" myself up to go there.

488,"I’ve been having pain in my bottom right jaw/wisdom tooth area as it’s growing in more. It’s partially impacted. I went today for a consultation about getting it removed. 

Long story short, X-rays show I HAVE to get it removed. I am absolutely HORRIFIED of having this procedure. 

I have never had surgery nor been put under, and I think that’s mostly what I’m concerned about. 

I’m also a smoker and worried I won’t be able to go long after surgery without wanting to smoke but obviously, terrible idea because dry sockets. 

Can anyone give me some reassurances about this procedure? I’m sure the next two weeks I’ll lose a lot of sleep and I can’t even imagine getting in the car to drive there the morning of... I’ll be shaking like a chihuahua. 

Ever since I left today I’ve been in a horrible funk and I’ve cried several times. I’m having so much anxiety and I know it’s only going to get worse the closer the procedure gets. 

Tips, advice? Regarding the procedure and/or how to alleviate anxiety that comes along with it. ",1
489,"Pretty much the title. I would ask her, but she has a very hard time talking about it, due to a variety of factors, but mainly because it is the same disorder her dad suffers from, who she has a terrible relationship with. When she initially told me, I remember there being an active subreddit that gave me a lot of information while I tried to help her through her struggles.  
Some of the major symptoms she suffers from are:  
Major Anxiety  
Panic Attacks  
Trouble Sleeping  
Occasional Depression  
Trouble Focusing  

The only thing I can remember about the sub was everyone posting kept referring to someone as ""My Person."" I assumed this person was their confidant, who they were able to tell everything too. I believe I am that for my girlfriend, so I am trying to help her out by being more informed. Thanks

490,"I always feel anxious when I receive long audio messages, especially since I've started working with a guy who almost exclusively sends 5min long audios with dozens of demands and requests for me. Of course, I'm too anxious to tell him that I don't like voice notes...

But then I found out a app that has been helping me a lot. You share the voice note with it, and it converts it to text! It's amazing. The best part for me is that is doesn't mark the audio as ""listened"", so you think about the answer with less pressure. 

Have in mind that the transcription is not perfect at all, of course, you shouldn't rely solely on it. But it gives you a nice heads up about the subject. I will usually listen to the whole audio after I thought about it, but with much less anxiety now that I know what it is about. 

The app:
https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=it.mirko.transcriber

I have no affiliation whatsoever with the developer. Weeks ago I was thinking about how great it would be if we could transcribe voice notes, and then I thought ""what if there's an app that already does that?"". I looked at the play store, and there it was.",1

494,"I’ve been with my boyfriend for 7 months and we’ve been generally great up until the past couple months. I’m 24 and he’s 20 and he lives with me. (I live I a shared house with 7 others for uni)
At first I would barely say a few words to him and he would start every convo on our dates etc and he was always great with my anxiety, we took things very slow. 

We have come so far in the 7 months we’ve been together I’m completely myself, I can chat to him about anything now. 

However, we had a fight yesterday and he says I make him feel small when I get mad at him because I shut down and just ‘blank him’ over nothing. I have tried to explain to him that I don’t mean to do this and that it’s just an automatic thing I do to cope in these situations. He got really mad at me and started saying how it’s not normal that I don’t kiss him first or hug him first and that he hasn’t seen me without makeup yet. I thought this was totally unfair to say as there’s nothing I want more than to be ‘normal’ and be able to do those things with him but I felt like he was rushing me and making me feel like a freak. 


He broke up with me there and then and I sent him a message explaining all this to him and he says he wants to talk tomorrow. I don’t know what to do, he says he understands but he doesn’t or he wouldn’t of said all that and he wouldn’t have broken up with me. 

He knows how high my anxiety is, I do take Citalopram but have been feeling very down recently and my anxiety has gotten so bad that I just haven’t gone into uni this year and he started laying into me about that telling me that I just need to do it like it’s that easy. 

I don’t know if I should be with him or what I should do?

495,"I find summer and the build up to summer a terrible time for my anxiety. So much pressure to be happy that the weather getting better (as if that's enough to be happy). So much expectation to be out enjoying yourself more because the days are longer, evenings brighter. So many more social activities are scheduled - parties, BBQs, after work drinks, family trips. So many more warm days that require less clothes and much more scrutiny on my body.

497,"I have had depression and anxiety much of my life. I generally play it safe and would stay in my comfort zone far too often, which includes my once stable job. I always thought that if I put in the effort I would probably stay at the company until I retire. A change in management caused my sense of job security to drop and anxiety spike. Many people have quit specifically because of new boss so I know it wasn't just me. I survived for the past 5+ years since the shakeup, but there are trends within my group and the company that I can no longer ignore. While I am not going to get fired anytime soon, the stress of an unhealthy workplace (boss) has made my life a mess.


The issue isn't just my current job's stability either. I work in a niche field and job opportunities are relatively uncommon unless I move a few states away. That alone was enough to make my anxiety spike even prior to the new boss taking over. I am not sure I want to do this kind of job anymore either; the pay is good but I am a rather burnt out. After a not so stellar annual review I got recently, I decided a change is required. I had had enough.


I have always loved to create things. From physical things like planning and installing a paver brick patio all by myself, to software like making simple programs, or working on graphics. I have always had a dream to make my own video games but never really put enough effort into making it happen, until now. I put together a calendar with my own deadlines, started writing notes and outlines on all the things I want to do, and finally got serious. I already have put in a solid 30 hours the last few weeks. Whats strange is that even though I am treating this like a part time job on the side, I now wake up looking forward to each day to work on it. I have a renewed sense of purpose that is helping me in my battle with anxiety.


TL;DR: Retreating to my comfort zone was not healthy in the long run. I realized that If I want change, I have to make serious attempts to make it happen. ",1
498,"Curious what you all think about this and it’s something I’ve been contemplating recently:

I really enjoy bourbon. The taste, the flavor, the burn, and of course, the way it relaxes me and helps me switch in to “me” time! I particularly like one brand and if they don’t have my preference, I’d rather not drink at all. That being said, if they don’t have it, I’ll just wait and have some when I get home instead. It’s my favorite part of closing down the stress of the day and moving in to relaxation mode for the evening. When I go abroad, I bring a few nips of my brand because honestly, I would prefer not to drink anything else, but I still want to be able to enjoy a drink after the day. Though I guess I would actually have something else? Maybe a small amount but definitely not much. Side note, i actually bring some food items with me when I travel too, for the same reason...I really like my daily routine and like to have specific snacks at certain times of the day. 

I have 1-2 every day with dinner or while cooking. Sometimes I’ll have 3, but usually lose the desire to keep going after that (i never during the day or with lunch, unless there’s a rare outing or event that calls for it, otherwise, water only...I don’t even want it). On the weekends, it may be a bit more at night but max only 1 more (4 total), because honestly, I like getting buzzed, but not super drunk, and never blackout. 

The conundrum is that I do have anxiety sometimes, and while I love this routine, the anxious side of me is terrified of being called an alcoholic because I really do enjoy it so much and don’t want to cut it out of my day. So, the big question is, am I addicted, dependent or just really obsessed with my routine (I def have some OCD tendencies and like things structured to be the same every day)? I like it, it hasn’t really interfered with my life, and I don’t need to keep going once I’ve had a few (No need to clear the bottle), though we do all get a bit carried away now and then I suppose!

If you can’t tell, I’m extremely routine oriented, so no question, if I take a few nights off, I’ll miss it and probably crave it because, again, it’s like a favorite reward after the day.... I look forward to it! How do I know if I’m craving the alcohol or the routine? Does any of this sound like a problem? And before anyone says “if you have to ask, it is”, just know that anxiety makes you think everything is a problem! Haha. I’m also realizing how crazy some of this sounds, but just know, I’m being brutally honest. Feedback welcome!",1
499,"I was raised with pretty good manners. I was always taught to say hi to people or give at least a polite nod. Not only is it nice, but it can help lead into actual conversations

However, this doesn’t work if no one ever says hi back. I make sure not to interrupt anyone’s their phone or with headphones in unless I really want to, which isn’t often. 

Even if I make eye contact and give a wave people just seem to look and ignore me, but I’ve barley see anyone else dealing with this. It’s just that no one says hi to me. I don’t get many good mornings or goodbyes. It makes me feel super weird and awkward.

I know it sounds super needy, I just wish people noticed me a little more. I don’t want to be the center of attention but a smile a day is always a nice way to go and gives me a little rush of happiness too :(",1

I have a good amount of money saved up, and a boyfriend with a great job who's constantly telling me to be less frugal and that I can buy things and enjoy life.

Not wanting to say something because my anxiety told me it was stupid) but now, I've been having points where it's not even explainable like that, just pure anxiety without a thought process, locking me down so I dont even do anything, just frozen in place with a blank mind.

Today in school I had my water bottle under my shoulder while I was taking something out of my bag and I try getting past this group of people and end up accidentally dropping my bottle. It drops and hits some people’s feet and then is on the floor and there is people talking to their friends in the corridor and none of them are looking at me so I guess they didn’t notice but for some reason I could not bring myself to pick it up for fear of embarrassment or confrontation and so I didn’t pick it up and just went to my next lesson. As I’m walking away I’m thinking “why why why can’t you pick that bottle up you piece of sh*t” it actually is like a wall preventing me from doing stuff. I just can’t bring myself to do stuff where I will be looked at or judged or FEEL like I’m being looked at or judged even if I know I’m most likely not. I also am like a door mat and am afraid of saying no when people ask me to borrow stuff and even when I REALLY wanna say no I can’t bring myself to say it. I also am really bad at having eye contact with someone I haven’t talked to often before. it’s especially hard when I have to talk to girls. So..do I have anxiety?

510,"❗Trigger warning: I'll describe my fear shortly, don't want it to scare you.❗


So my way of coping with anxiety is ridiculing my fears and using rationality and logic to destruct them. It's like in Harry Potter where humour is used to tear down irrational fears except I rather use science than normal magic. 

Like honestly, if it wasn't for free scientific research on the internet about anxiety I wouldn't be in a good place. I assume some people feel the same and thus I wanted share some excellent truth about anxiety. I'm writing this post mainly to help fellow anxious people and also to distract myself from my ridiculous fears since my friends are asleep right now and I don't want to wake them.

So basically my biggest fear right now, mainly because of all the stress and anxiety I've been having over the past few years is that I'll lose my mind and turn into some Hulk like version of me and end up hurting anyone. Especially because sometimes my brain feels so idk electrified after stress that I'm scared it might damage my brain. Which is as ridiculous as it sounds, especially considering I'm a vegan and a pacifist who often cares too much about other people rather than himself.

So here are some truth about anxiety: 


Believing you are about to lose your mind is a common catalyst to a panic attack, where the fear of losing your mind and the changes the stress response make fuel each other.

But even though the fear of going crazy can be frightening, it’s not an indication of a problem with your brain, mind, or sanity. It’s just another indication that your body is experiencing a stress response and/or of a body that’s overly stressed.

People who have been under a lot of stress often experience this symptom.

It's important to note that there is no connection between anxiety and going crazy. While it may feel like you could go crazy due to anxiety, you actually can't. It's a physical impossibility.

Ergo, sometimes, anxiety is like this thing that can make you think the worst fears even though a lot of these fears have no base in reality. For me it helps to remember that my fears are irrational and to look at the data that is out there. 

For example, to get back to my fear. In the past 22 years of my life I've never turned in the Hulk monster that I fear to become, nor am I in that state now and there is no good reason to believe I'll be in that state anytime soon. I've been through worse panic attacks and I'm still me, therefore my Hulk fear is very unlikely.

517,"Hi all, TL;DR below.

First, about me.  I have had anxiety.  I have had it my whole life.  I was able to control a lot of it because my family told me to ""suck it up and quit feeling sorry for myself"" as loving families to.  This of course led to many breakdowns, most of which were done alone, as to not shame myself or the FaMiLy!  I turned to alcohol and pot because I was a hoot when wasted.

Good, friends, a good wife, and overcoming fears has helped.  I still take a bit of anti anxiety that has really helped too.  I now drink a beer or two on occasion, that's about it.

I see myself in my youngest daughter.  She is 12,  over emotional and anxious for many things, yet she is so creative.  Anyway, she had to do a report on something she knew nothing about.  It was due in two days, had to be both as an essay and a powerpoint pres.  Her initial reaction was one of fear, crying, even rage.  Just bringing up that she had a 3 minute presentation (to 40 friends and family) had her in a panic.

She and I sat down and did the report.  It didn't take too long and we had a nice report in her words within a couple hours, along with sources and a powerpoint.

Now she had knowledge of what she was going to speak about.  She wrote down the highlights for her speech (basically the point from the presentation) and she started to practice.

God it was painful.  The first few times She couldn't even start.  If she stumbled over a word she'd freeze up and start crying.  All of this was just in front of me!  I found that letting her go through it without me adding ""helpful"" information was better.

Eventually she could get through it with out crying and only the fear of death on her face.  A few more times and she wasn't stumbling through.  A couple more and she was going so fast that she had to slow down so that she was within the minimum time.

The next morning she put her notes on easier to read note cards and practiced a few more times.  By the time she did the speech for real she looked like a pro, and even made eye contact.  I was so proud of her, and she was proud of herself.

Public speaking can still induce panic in me, and I am a 51 yo guy.  But, if I know my shit, I am fine.  Confidence (an passion) in knowing what you are talking about helps so much.

518,"I honestly wasn’t sure where to post this so apologies if it doesn’t belong here. I’ve been feeling like quite a few close “friends” and family in my life are extremely selfish. Meaning that I’ll always ask them about their lives and be there for them as much as I can, but they never return the favor. They barely even know what I’m up to - no idea what my job is, how my relation is going, etc. because they NEVER ask.

So, I work, probably twice a week, part-time. For a while now, I have felt anxious, useless, and like I don't belong there. It's a combination of low self-esteem, paranoia (of being disliked, of not being good enough), and jealousy (of the newbies who fit in so much better than I do). It was especially bad this past week (I have a personal relationship with someone at work, and the other day I was trying to help by telling him something, but he still went to confirm anyway... I'm probably just being stupid, but that kinda hurt.. I ended up pretty much rushing out of work for a lunch break because my anxiety was getting bad. I even had to take a breather in the bathroom, which was a first for me..)

Today was the first day I felt it was a good day. Honestly I attribute a big part of it to the person I worked with today. He's an amazing mentor. He goes above and beyond answering my questions, and I feel like I've learned a lot from him in one day. He also doesn't make me feel like an outsider, or make me feel useless, and tells me he appreciates my help. I think, sometimes being around people that make you feel important, or special, helps with the anxiety..

It's like I'm subconsciously reliving every panic attack, every act of self harming, every binge, every miserable thought I ever had here. It doesn't feel like home. It feels like prison. 


All these feelings totally caught me off guard because I love my parents and I love where I live. I don't know what to do.",1

525,"Hi all. Throwaway account. I would really appreciate some advice. Currently in third semester of grad school, specializing in Computational Chemistry. When I applied for my research group, the advisor had expressed to me that he was planning to retire soon, but was willing to give me a shot. So far my experience has been relatively good, and my advisor has been helpful with any research related help I've needed. The last few weeks however, I've been questioning whether I really belong in the program. Back in October I got out of an extremely toxic friend relationship that I didn't realize was abusive until I started going to my therapist. Ever since the ""Friend"" left, I felt like I've been slipping. My fear of failure and paranoia that people (including my advisorand especially other grad students) hate me and don't think I belong in the program has shot through the roof. The class I teach is a senior level lab, and I'm the only TA who's ran it in the department, as the other experienced TA's have graduated. I've had to spend this semester coaching a first semester TA through the course that I barely know myself, as I'd only ran it once before. My work production has slowed to a crawl due to a combination of this and the fact that calculations we ran took almost 10x longer than we were expecting. I've tried my best to muscle my way through it, but it feels like the floor is falling out under me. My office is right next to my instructor's, and about a week and a half ago, I'd overheard him talking about me and I feel like during my third semester review I'm going to get dropped from the program. I had a panic attack in my office, but didn't tell him. I tried opening up to him a bit, and apologized to him last week but I'm worried he might've seen it as just making excuses right before the review. I honestly don't know what I'll do if I'm dropped. I started seeing a therapist in December, and have mentioned this offhand to my advisor, but understandably he is relatively distant when it comes to personal matters like this. I feel like I'm going to get dropped from the program because of a shithead I've tried my hardest to cut out of my life. I'm doing a practice presentation with my advisor tomorrow and even though it's just going to be him and two other students, I'm absolutely terrfied. Do you guys have any advice or recommendations? I would really appreciate any help.",1

527,"TLDR: READ BOLD

Hey guys 21 year old male here. I have bene suffering from GAD + Anticipation anxiety since I was a small child + severe insomnia (that has led to breakdowns and crying after 5-8 consecutive days without sleeping due to anxiety). I started meds when I was 15. My first psych but me on Celexa and Ambien, ambient didn't work so she put me on 1mg Klonopin.

It's at this moment I really figured out the range of Benzos, I only heard of Xanax, but when I walked out with my script and googled klonopin it made me optimistic. Yes, it finally put me to sleep for about 6 months. I saw this psych for 2 years then I turned 18 and decided to stop taking meds. It's to long of a story to go into all the semantics right now.

&amp;#x200B;

**Anyways, going to see a 1 psych on Wednesday and another on Friday. I do not plan on releasing previous med information as its not necessary other than the basics. I am a student + I have a internship at a insurance company I don't want to fuck up.  can't continue to not sleep**

**My primary care doc has been prescribing me Klonopin .5 because I asked for 3 months now, it's the 4th month and I asked him for 60 .5mg now. This will probably be my final script guys. I need a psych asap. I've tried every SSRI ever. Feel free to ask questions I'll answer, trying to keep this short.**

  
**What I am asking is, what should I reasonably ""suggest"" to receive as a form of treatment Klonopin + their suggestions, Temazepam for sleep? Halcion? Xanax + Klonopin in combination therapy? I've been prescribed this before as a teen at 16. Kps + xans**",1
528,So I quit smoking about 2-3 months ago but after the first month I smoked one cig and the anxiety got worse. Then again a week later I smoked one cig and got even worse. Then hey guess what again I’m stupid enough to smoke one more a week later. Now it’s been like 3-4 weeks after that last one I’m never going back to them again. But now everyday it seems like my anxiety is getting worse and worse. For example I feel the normal fast heart rate then slowly I get nauseous and feel like I’m going to vomit. But every time that has happen I don’t I just have a big burp. Then I happens again right after but not as intense. And it happens mostly everyday. Has anyone else gone through this exact same anxiety attack?  If so how do you avoid the nauseousness ,1
529,"For about 6 years since gaining debt (car, paying for rent, utilities, etc.) I have been afraid of missing time from work. I will put off doctor's visits, ignore things that I should have checked out, and self diagnose things based off of endless reading.

I have anxiety of losing my car, my home, not being able to provide for my wife and son, and requiring a costly medical procedure that I cannot afford if I do have things checked out. This anxiety stems from the fear of being out of work and being fired by my employer. I'm sure the male mindset of just toughing things out also comes into play, but the fear of being fired due to need of medical care scares me into procrastinating medical appointments. I think sometimes I'm also afraid of being told I have a bad problem that will require surgery (another fear) or be something that is life altering.  

How can I break free of this anxiety to take better care of myself not only for my own health but for my family's sake also? ",1

531,"I just watched a video of a little boy drowning in a pool. It brought me right back.

I was at a pool party, didn't know how to swim, had a life vest most of the party, then gave my life vest to my best friend (we were like 5) then I decided I could swim and jumped in, I indeed could not swim and I was under, drowning, inhaling water and no adult saw me. My best friend with her life jacket ended up grabbing my arm and pulling me to the stairs and when I told the adults no one belived me. My mom didn't believe me until I threw up the chlorine water all night long . Now I'm like a cat and don't goin water unless it's like 200 degrees outside.

I feel like this event made me scared of everything. I almost faced death. I faced helplessness. I faced aloneness. I faced the fact that you are very alone even with everyone around.

It makes me sick thinking about it. I never realized how this event really has been a part of my life, my entire life.

Maybe I'm just really sensitive. 

I mean in an adult now. I faced my fears and did learn how to swim, despite the fact I hate water and will the rest of my life.

I still force myself to do things I fear, but that doesn't mean I don't feel the anxiety.bi short ess of breath, my limbs going numb, racing thoughts or even blank thoughts. 

I'm overwhelmed all the time it seems. I have a hard time facing life. But I do it. Wish I could get rid of anxiety though.... ",1

533,"Hi everyone, I'm 22 and about to graduate from my community college with   an associate's in studio arts. Afterwards I would move on to a four  year  college to finish. The thing is, I'm having these recurring waves  of  feeling... like I've ruined my life. Up to high school I wanted to  do  something in medicine, but I realized that I hated school, and going  to  college, that I was also completely uninterested in pursuing  science.

At  the same time, I have  always loved art and I've kept up  drawing/painting the whole time, so  eventually I decided to switch my  major to studio arts - and when  transferring to a four year school, I  will be double majoring in  digital art as well. I'm genuinely excited to  do anything art related,  and I think I've become pretty good at it -  showing promise, you know?  The thing is, I've been having some stress  related health issues  lately, so I thought after graduating I would take  a semester off and  start posting my art online, which is something I've  never done before.

But  I keep getting  these horrible feelings that I'm ruining my life, or  I'll never be able  to support myself financially. That maybe I should  have stuck to  studying science, even if I don't enjoy it. It happens in  periods of a  couple of days, usually, where I feel like my life is  just... over.

I'm just freaking out about it.",1
534,"If anyone can offer any help or advice It'd really mean a lot.  I've swung in and out of mild depression for years, and always had bad anxiety as early as 15.  There's been a lot of stages where I feel fine, and a lot of depprssive ones, it's kinda been all over the place in the last few years.  

I was extremely happy, in good shape, eating well, saving a few months ago.  But it all came apart in the span of about 2 months. I dropped out of school, lost my job, blew threw my entire savings, lost almost 30pounds and lost most of my friends  I've been through a lot in my life but the last two months I've had everything come back and much stronger than before.  

The last week I've been having daily mood swings and sometimes it's really intense.. Like sober euphoria, or really happy, then just a few hours later it goes back to deppressive.  I've had 3 panic attacks in the last two weeks, I've never had any in my life before that.  I'm having really intense pins/needles feeling all over my chest, this caused one of my panic attacks a few days ago and I went to the ER for it.  Doctor said everything looked fine physically and sent me on my way.  Since that my anxiety has gotten much worse, I can hardly leave my room.  My hunger is gone, like all day, I have no urge to eat.  I either sleep too much or too little.  It all just came so fast like I've never had it before.   ",1
535,"Hey guys!

Just wanted to share my experience with anxiety and panic attacks and how I'm convinced I cured them.

Backstory: 

I've always been an anxious person (it runs in my family), but around October 2018 I started experiencing panic attacks that scared me enough to put me in the ER a handful of times only to be told that I had anxiety. It was debilitating and exhausting - It got to a point where would have at least three panic attacks a day and I started getting mild agoraphobia. I felt on edge 24/7 and every little feeling in my body would send my heart rate to 150-180bpm. I saw my primary care doctor, she told me I had anxiety. I saw a cardiologist, she told me I had anxiety....anxiety anxiety anxiety.

&amp;#x200B;

Finally, about two months ago, I decided to join in with my mom on an instagram challenge called ""4 Days Without Sugar"" - not for anxiety purposes but because I thought it would be a good challenge to do to detox a bit. Three days go by and I'm still feeling the same, but with a lot more energy. By day four, my panic attacks were gone and I was feeling like the girl I used to be. My energy levels were high and I was also losing weight (winning!) - I decided to stick with it since it was benefiting me so much. Fast forward two months and I haven't had a single panic attack since!!! I tried a little experiment and ate a piece of cake a couple of weeks ago...after about 30 mins I started feeling shortness of breath and palpitations again - CRAZY!! I got to researching and turns out there's an interesting connection between the gut and the brain, and sugar and processed foods affect your brain negatively. Pretty nuts!!

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway, I wanted to share my experience because it might help someone on here as well - YOU'VE GOT THIS!! :)",1

538,"So my problem is that I have troubles attending classes due to my social anxiety. I'm on my 3rd year of university and I attend two classes at the moment, each once a week. Participation isn't mandatory, but I still feel like I should attend as much as possible to learn as much as possible and hopefully improve my grades this summer.  
The problem for me is that I find it really difficult just to show up. It hasn't been always been a problem and I used to attend most classes without worrying the first couple of semesters. But whenever I think of going to class, I start to feel anxious, I start to sweat and get nauseous and start to fear all kinds of crazy scenarios like vomiting in front of everyone or passing out - which has never happened before, but still something that I fear will happen. I really don't want to make a fool out of myself or show my anxiety to others.  
This has been going on for a month or so now and each time I want to improve, but I usually end up getting so scared of what COULD happen in the classroom that I end up not going and just study at home instead. I'm really afraid that it's going to hurt my grades and that I've already screwed up everything by not showing up.  
I do go to therapy and I also have a mentor in which we practice using public transportation, but the classroom thing is still a major issue and I have trouble sharing my issues, even with my therapist.   
My question is then: Does anyone else have this problem and what's your best method for actually going to class and getting a good experience? I'm sure that it'll get better once I can get myself to show up and make a habit out of it, but right now it's extremely hard just to get to campus since I start to feel anxious and even physically ill before showing up at all.",1

I take 25mg every 3 days now, so I'm on the home stretch, but this is the most difficult reduction yet. I take holy basil when I feel like I need it, and try to eat foods that naturally boost serotonin. Any advice on coping? Luckily my withdrawal symptoms don't tend to last longer than a month, so I'm comforted by knowing that. Thanks :)",1

I have started to wake up most mornings with thoughts of suicide, and the fact my brain has begun to take me to that place scares the fuck out of me.

543,"I was fine up until the interview itself. Wasn’t very nervous at all, and I felt quite confident. Then came the questions about why I’m in my field, why I’m not employed at the moment, and then they asked me if I have interviews very often. I didn’t expect that, and at that point it derailed me. I’m pretty sure they were commenting on how inexperienced or nervous I seemed, and I thought I came off as knowledgeable and confident. Not the case, apparently. After my awkward answer to their question (something along the lines of “not in a while, the last one was last year and I was not seriously looking for another job at the time”), they shook my hand and told me they’ll make a decision within the next couple weeks after they interview a few others. I didn’t really feel a connection between us at all, and sensed little to no common ground. I keep telling myself I’m glad I went, but in all honesty I just wanna hide from the world. I can’t do that, I gotta keep looking and opening more doors. Maybe look into working with animals, which I love dearly and care deeply about. Idk. I just wish I weren’t so awkward.

544,My very first therapy session is coming up soon!!!! It's on Tuesday April 9 at 10 in the morning. I'm actually really excited for it.,1
545,"I apologize in advance for the wall of text coming. I'm on mobile and will try to break it up as much as possible. 

I've posted before about my anxiety that came on very suddenly almost 7 years ago. I was fine one day and not the next. I loved driving, it was my ""think"" time. I was very social and going places and meeting new people.

 One day, after a short drive down the interstate and while stopped at an intersection, I got very dizzy, vision blurred and I had a massive panic attack. Every time after that when I drove the panic attacks would come on almost immediately. After that, even being in a vehicle would cause vertigo, dizziness, nausea, panic attacks, racing intrusive thoughts and headaches.

 Then I became unable to do my own grocery shopping and had to pay others to do my errands. I was miserable and isolated. I felt like an utter failure as a person and a mother. I eventually lost my job my house and my car because I could no longer drive or even stand to be in public without feeling awful. Lights were too bright and everything made me dizzy. Eventually I became depressed because of my isolation but I kept on.

Everyone I talked to told me I needed meds. Doctors said the same thing but I had this strong feeling that something was physically wrong with me, not chemically. For the last 6 1/2 years I searched and searched and nothing fit. I had never been in an accident, not had anything particularly scary happen, no head injuries.... so what happened?!

 Last year while, again, searching for my answer I found an eye condition called vertical heterophoria. I got excited. Could it be my eyes?! I had all the symptoms and it made total sense. As soon as my husband got home we went to the local walmart eye center to have me examined. The Doctor told me there was nothing wrong with my eyes and that I should get my head examined instead. I am near quoting him! I cried all the way home, ugly snot tears. 

Since then I kept reading about vertical heterophoria. It just made too much sense. I found out the your regular eye Dr can't diagnose this because there isn't anything wrong with your eyes individually. You can still see but your eyes are constantly straining. 

I filled out a survey online for the specialist in Michigan and the next day I got a call. They had an office in Kentucky and wanted me to come in.

 We made all the plans and went up there this past Wednesday. I was an absolute WRECK on the drive up there. It's a 10 hour drive from where we live and just a 30 minute drive is torture for me. God bless my husband and kids for being there to support me or I wouldn't have made it. 

The next day I go in for my exam. They did 5 different tests and scans of my eyes. Then the Doctor did a few more test where I had to cover one eye and follow a laser on a scoreboard and read. He put these crazy looking glasses on me and we started figuring out which prisms I could see through. Almost as soon as he had the right ones in there I felt my mind relax. I was so calm! Before I had the glasses on I couldn't see the last two lines of the eye chart and the board I was reading off of looked weird. After wearing them just 20 minutes I could read almost everything! I had no idea my vision was so bad. He showed me a chart of something near and far with green lines where I should see and red where I did see. It was no where near where it should be. I'm looking past everything! When he had to take the glasses off I got so dizzy I thought I would faint. My whole world spun around. I couldn't afford to get the glasses right then ($650) so I set up payments with them for over the phone since we live so far away. He told me for the ride home to cover 1 eye and that should help a little. A LITTLE?! I was able to sit up and enjoy the ride home! See the mountains and cities and traffic and I felt a little wobbly but I was calm. I probably said ""this is amazing"" 100 times on the way home. 

Within the next couple of weeks I should have my glasses and the Dr said to wait 2 weeks for my eyes to fully adjust and then I could start driving. I'm already making plans to take my kids fishing and hiking, to the water park and getting a job! I've missed people! Once I have my glasses I will post an update. 

 The Dr told me that some people are so off balance that they walk in the office with a cane and once they have their glasses they walk straight out! That's amazing! He also said that I was most likely born with this and as I got older I was less able to compensate and my eyes and brain eventually said no. Looking back, that makes sense. I had subtle symptoms since I was 18 (32 now) and never considered my eyes or even that anything was wrong, until I couldn't drive. 

I hope this post reaches someone out there who feels stuck and hopeless like I did. Specialists for this seem pretty spread out but it is worth the trip and the money to feel better. To truly address the problem! It is all worth it. 

TL:DR- thought I had anxiety turns out my eyes don't play well together.",1

I posted something recently but I have a couple follow up points because my situation has evolved. I'm currently seeing this guy (26M) I'm 22F. He's a former Marine, absolutely adorable, and we have so much in common. We are fuck buddies turned seeing each other. We had our third date/hang out session this past weekend. We went all over town, got dinner, and stayed in an AirBnb (both our home situations aren't great for a partner to spend the night). We both discussed plans for the summer and he even invited me to the Marine ball in November if things work out. I am very excited with all of these prospects. But my anxiety is spiking like crazy. Nothing has ever worked out for me. Nothing past a few weeks at least. I haven't had a longer term relationship in years.

I am worried I'm annoying him, I'm coming on too strong already, and if I ask him to be with me in a few weeks I'll get shot down. We have been talking for over a month.

I know this a long ass ramble but I'm freaking out. How do I keep calm? He knows I have anxiety and has been understanding so far. I just want this to work.

My friend got me a new job in a tourist attraction in my city. Prior to my start date I had a birthday party to attend, then the next day I had another birthday to attend which was my own.  I had one rest day where I was completely dead from going out and drinking. All my friends and family were so supportive and congratulatory towards me because they know how big a step this is for me, I haven't been employed in a year and a half. Last night I went to be at midnight, which is not great but by my standards not the worst either. I woke up about 5 time between 12 and 7 for long periods of time and felt as if I was going to get sick, as well as sweating. I had my first induction session that lasted 8 hours. For a decent part of the induction I was fighting off a panic attack and not even focusing on what was going on. Finally we get to the place I'm going to be working at and its covered in fluorescent lighting, which triggers the derealization I sometimes experience, but is my worst fear. I simply can't work in this area and even some of the other parts of the place are anxiety inducing to me. I really don't feel up to the task.

I came home feeling soulless because I was so tired and anxious all day. I came home and my parents are super happy for me, but it makes me feel worse because I feel like I'm going to let them down. I feel like I'm going to let everyone down again. All my friends have showed me a lot of support and are genuinely happy for me and I feel as if I won't be able to work in this place. I cried for half an hour when I got home just thinking about this. I'm in again for 4 days this week, all 8 hour shifts starting early in the morning.

However this is a really small company and no HR or any sort of organization. I was told I would be given an employee handbook but never got one. I just started my 4th week here and haven't been paid yet. I feel weird and anxious bringing it up because I have no idea who I would even talk to about this besides the president of the company and he is constantly busy. I have bills due this week so I gave myself a goal for the day to say something. It's midday and I haven't. My stomach is in knots and I don't know what to do.

They are all gorgeous.

Pls tell me I'm not alone. ,1
564,"A little background. I have anxiety that causes me to excessively worry at night about my family dying. It causes me to not be able to sleep or sleep well. Often falling asleep as I cry myself to sleep. My last dr appt he didn't refill my meds like he was supposed too. I thought he did, because he had asked which ones needed refilled I said all. Apparently it didn't happen. So, that was my last dr visit in early February. March 3rd he quit his practice for a corporate doctor kind of job. I haven't found a new doctor yet because I had thought I had about 6 months...refill period. So I was getting quotes together and then compile and figure it out. Nope.

So, my sleeping pill is out. It relaxes me, helps me sleep, keeps me asleep, and helps with bipolar depression and anxiety. So I did not sleep well last night. Then, I had a fricken cockroach on my wall from my Uncle bringing them from his house to ours when he brings all his shit to spend the night. SO giant cockroach and no sleeping meds. It was at least 2am before I fell asleep and up this morning at 530 for school. I was/am exhausted. Had class this morning, did not do well in my math class if it were test day I'd had failed. I went blank on the easiest stuff, factoring. 

So, I go down to the commons and do my homework as best I can remember...didn't do well. I'm like fine I got to pee and then I'm going to my car to wait for my sister and then go home. I go to the handicap/family bathroom because I'm like SUPER butch and women think I'm a dude, men notice the tits so their like wtf as well. So I just use the family bathroom. I walked in having to pee really bad (side note: I have overactive bladder had since I was 7) so when I have to go, I have to go. I walked in the light was off which is not normal. It was pitched black until I finally found the switch. Got me off track. I go to the bathroom..........forget to lock the door..........someone walks in. Shoot me now! 

I legit walked the long ass way to my car so I wouldn't pass by this persons office (school official).

567,"Hi reddit, I wanted to share my anxiety experience that started a month ago and maybe get some suggestions.

I was doing my math homework one ordinary day and out of the blue, I felt like I was literally dying, couldnt feel my extremities, felt like I wasnt getting enough oxygen; thought I ate something rotten at first and it made me nauseous, but in 15 minutes it was all gone and I was back to normal.

Next day, felt like I wasnt getting enough air again and panicked really hard and I started vomiting. That's where it started to happen every moment, feeling like I cant breathe and get really 'panicky' all the time. I have been going to the doctors for the past 3 weeks and they found out nothing that would cause all of this, I did everything from blood work to MRIs, everything turned out fine.

After that I went to a neurologist and got diagonsed with acute anxiety and right now I take 1/2 lorazepam tablet at night so I can sleep.

Before all of this I had an unpleasent event, I got lost in the mountains this winter and I got rescued in about 16 hours I was frozen and I am lucky I am able to write this right now; but I still dont perceive it as a moment that would cause all of this, it felt like an adventure for me, I wasnt the kind of person that would worry about death, feeling out of breath all the time and stressed. Is it really happening because of this? Everyone says so, but I cant accept it, what should I do to try to get back to normal? I feel like an alien that just wrecked his ship on Earth.

I was originally summoned back in October, when my anxiety was at its worst, and I postponed for until now. I'm now trying to postpone a second time - in part because my work and school schedules are crazy hectic. I'm considering having my therapist write a letter on my behalf as well.

I may have used the wrong term for this but it always feels like I'm overstimulated. I'm wondering if anyone have any tips to keep calm in these situations.

I’m going off the meds now in hopes that they’ll bury themselves again because it’s starting to take it’s toll on my relationship. 

Has anyone else had to make a similar mental health/childhood issues sacrifice? 

Side note: before anyone says ‘just go to therapy and sort both the issues out’ I’m a student so I really don’t have that kind of disposable income. ",1
571,"    My Mother doesn't believe that anxiety disorders exist. She tends to roll her eyes whenever they are mentioned, and is adamate about the fact that 'everyone gets nervous'. Simply speaking, she doesn't see the difference between plain nerves and anxiety. I've tried over the years to explain the difference to her, using evidence and such. She shuts it down everytime. 

    My parents are not the type to go to a doctor or a therapist for help. I am homeschooled, so needless to say, I am isolated and have no clear and confidential way to reach out of a professional on mental health. I have not been diagnosed with an anxiety disorder by a professional. However, through my research of symptoms and causes of anxiety disorders, I am comfortable with saying I have anxiety issues. 

  I get overwhelmed fairly easily. For example, I could be sitting in the living room, family members walking past me, perhaps trying to start a conversation. My heart will start racing, and I start feeling very uncomfortable. Like they are circling me. I normally escape to my room if I can. This usually ends in me being teary-eyed or zoned out for a long period of time. If I can't escape, I become irratiable and try to excuse myself to the bathroom. 

I tend to rock myself back and forth in stressfull or overwhelming situations as well, which can be very comforting. Another tick that I have that I've been trying to stop doing is picking at scabs or skin, or chewing on my lip when I'm nervous. I chew on my lip way too much, to the point where its almost always scabbed and chapped. If I'm in a situation where I need something to ground me and keep me from breaking, I tend to pick at scabs or skin in order to feel better. I know these are unhealthy habits and I try to stop them as soon as I notice they start. But its hard when your getting yelled at for something so miniscule, and your trying not to break down and hyperventilate and cry. Sometimes the easiest thing for me to do to feel better and keep my mind occupied in those situations is to scratch or pick at something. 
 
  In social situations I also get overwhelmed. I personally think that being homeschooled since 2nd Grade is a direct influence on this. Its gotten better throughout the years, especially if I can go out in public and not have to talk to anyone, but often I still come home with shakey hands and a splitting headache. 
 
  My anxiety peaks at night. Lately, I've found myself unable to sleep and restless until 1 to 2 am. My heart starts racing, and whenever I try to lay down to sleep, I immediantly want to get up and pace back and forth in my room. My thoughts tend to race, thinking about different things such as whats going to happen in the next 5 years to something that happened 5 years ago. 

  Because of my lack of sleep, I get stuck in this vicious, sleep deprived cycle. I am always tired. I wake up tired. Im never motivated. I dont want to get out of bed in the mornings because I dread what is going to happen. During my school day I can stare at my computer screen for long periods of time without even doing anything. I zone out easily. Once I come out of it I tend to break down and get frustrated with myself for not being able to concentrate. 

  Sometimes I feel like I need to run. Like that thump in your chest that you get when your playing hide and seek with your friends, and they are counting down from ten seconds as you scramble for a hiding place. But it happens so randomly. And the only way to make it go away, is for me to break out into a sprint in order to calm myself down. 

 
(Also, just a disclaimer, I'm not trying to say that I definetly have anxiety. I dont want to offend anyone by assuming that I have it. But what I do know is that what I am going through isnt normal, and anxiety is the closest thing I can link it to until I get a professional diagnosis. )

&amp;#x200B;

Use a technique called semantic conversion. It’s pretty straightforward and useful in social and office settings.  
Social anxiety has a powerful core colored by the fear of being judged by others.

This manifests in all kinds of thoughts and an anxiety action-reaction. I say action-reaction because thoughts can cause anxiety and anxiety can cause unnecessary thoughts. In fact, at times, the two are just one homogeneous blob of discomfort.

Semantic conversion has 2 steps which handle the feedback system of thoughts and physical anxiety as well as behaviors such as social avoidance.  
Step 1: Mindfulness labeling  
Step 2: Constructive rephrasing

**Step 1 Mindfulness labeling:**

We are, by default, not very aware of our own thoughts, emotions, surroundings, and perceptions, biases, and physical responses.

You begin by noticing the details. Ask the following questions:  
1. What is it about the situation that is making me anxious?  
2. What are all the emotions I am feeling?  
3. Who are the thoughts related to?  
4. Do you actually know what people are thinking?  
5. Do they have a real basis for forming any judgment?

**Step 2 Constructive rephrasing:**

Now, articulate your thoughts and emotions with precision. It is important that you aim for precision. Learn new vocabulary if you need to. Suppose your feeling is captured by the thought ‘I feel like shit,’ mindfully label all the details and articulate it into something like ‘I feel ignored or judged because there is something wrong with me or I am dressed inappropriately.’

Add the emotional context- ‘I feel like an overwhelming spotlight is on top of me. This makes me conscious, self-aware, and critical.’

Once you’ve articulated your thoughts, it is time to rephrase them into something actionable. For example- I need to address this feeling and do something about it. Something that is in my control. Let me observe and see how others are dressed. Let me see if there is any real evidence of me being judged. I feel like I don’t know what to do, I should learn the skills.

This change is actionable. You can do something about it. This will help you **gain control**. You need it, and you \*are\* in control.

577,"I was hanging out at my friend's apartment last night. I was having a good time. My anxiety is getting a lot better and at that moment that night, I felt really peaceful and happy. My friend decided that that was a good time to start ""grilling"" me on everything I've done wrong in his eyes. He told me how I don't have a job, don't have a plan for life after college, don't do anything for myself, don't take charge of my life, that I have ""no empathy"" and that I ""can do better"". He said it in a way that was not empowering or friendly at all. He was basically telling me all the things I'm anxious about and then criticizing me for not facing them. He is a hypocrite because there are tons of things he isn't doing. He isn't perfect. Yet he thinks he can sit on his high horse and try to grill me about everything I'm anxious about. He assumed so many things about my life too. When I didn't agree with some of his assessments because, you know, he doesn't know shit about me, I suddenly ""wasn't listening"" and ""didn't want to accept the truth from anyone"". He told me that all my friends in our friend group hate me and that I'm not doing anything with my life.

&amp;#x200B;

This came out of nowhere from him and he went into things that weren't his business. I told him I didn't want to talk about it but he flat-out told me ""no"" and kept going. I eventually said I was going to leave if he didn't stop talking about it and he said ""fine"". I was really shocked by that because...don't you want to hang out with me? Don't you want me here because I'm your friend? Or do you just want to tell me things that you've convinced yourself about me and not listen to me? I felt too anxious to call him out on his own hypocrisies, so I just sat there and listened to him criticize me for 3 hours. It's one of those things where I realized how fucked up it is only a couple days after.

I originally chose the 'venting' flair for this post but once I saw the one that said 'needs a hug' it just hit my heart and I had to choose that one.

I don't know how to stop feeling this way. I feel so overwhelmed recently and I'm just sitting here crying as I type this. I can't even talk to anyone about how I'm feeling, even though I know they want to listen and help I just immediately feel so incredibly guilty for burdening them with my thoughts and problems that I just want to take back everything I just said. I feel so tense all the time, it takes me ages to fall asleep because I have constant worry that people I love are going to die. Especially my family, my boyfriend and my cats. Throughout the day and night I have these intrusive thoughts that something bad will happen to them, and I've developed a kind of superstition that I have to pray and pray and pray desperately or else the bad thing will happen. Some might say that prayer would help with this anxiety, but it's become an obsession, I'm not even very religious any more but my whole life praying has been the only way I felt like I had control over a scary situation so I guess I revert back to it. But I end up praying desperately and it sounds like begging - ""please please please please please Lord don't let anything happen please please"" and every night I have to run through a whole long prayer sequence praying specifically for every single person/animal that I'm worried about, including myself because I have constant anxiety that I'm going to die. It drives me crazy having this begging in my head all the time, 80% of my day is spent either worrying about my family or doing this desperate praying. To fall asleep at night I have to watch youtube videos, even if I'm exhausted I HAVE to have something to fall asleep to to take my mind off it.

I've been struggling to keep up with my university work too because of feeling constantly tense and stressed out and mentally exhausted from all the constant worrying and praying. I have an essay due tomorrow (and its 8pm here right now so I am going to be up all night) that I just haven't been able to do because my state of mind has just been terrible. The thought of not handing it in on time makes me feel 100 times more stress and is actually what just caused this panic attack I'm busy having. There is an extension procedure but I'm not sure if it's too late to apply, and since I don't have any documentation from a therapist backing up my reason they might not grant me the extension. I just don't know what to do. I should probably go attempt it now, even if I write it through my tears and do terribly at least I will be handing something in. Thanks to anyone who read this &lt;3

583,"Ever since I was the passenger in a car accident on my birthday (February 22nd), my anxiety has flared up through the roof. It hasn't gotten that much better, though it's usually okay if I distract myself from it.

I get weird about my breathing, especially in public places like a classroom or movie theater. My vision is blurred nowadays from the lack of sleep, and my body is hyper sensitive to everything. I'm constantly fatigued, and I'm struggling to deal with everyday tasks.

Two nights ago I tried Diphenhydramine as a sleep aid, and it worked... But now last night it didn't work, even after taking a Benedryl with it like a pharmacist had suggested.

I'm not on any medication and hadn't been for years, but it just seems like things are spiraling out of control. I can't sleep for shit, much less want to be in a classroom. I used to enjoy sleep so much... I don't know why everything went to shit the way it did. It's been like this for weeks now. I'm debating on seeing a psych, but psychs have always made me nervous especially due to a previous Benzodiazepine addiction. At night my mind just races and paces along with my heart, and I can't even think properly like I used to. I could daydream and think about anything, but the brain fog has made everything uncertain.

I have an exam Wednesday I'm sure, and yet I can't even get out of bed to go turn in assignments in my damn Math 053 class. I've tried melatonin, blue light filters, strict bed time schedules... I just don't get why everything is going to shit or how to stop it. Depression is ruining any enjoyment of leisure activities I might have as well.

I still need to get a new therapist as well, as my last one left his position... Everything is just falling apart and I don't know how to pick up the pieces, or what to try. Or if I should even care anymore. My mom (I'm 27) just lays in bed all day and sleeps, and I'm here just struggling to eat food as my appetite continues to convince myself I'm hungry when I ate three meals a day.

So i have to go to work tomorrow. Nothin special right? I don't know really. At this time, thinking about it, i feel unease. To be more specific... I nearly have an anxiety attack in fear of having an anxiety attack tomorrow about having an anxiety attack so that my co-workers notice that i have anxiety attacks.

Yep, that's my life right now. pretty nonsensical isn't it? The point is, i guess i have to tell them. But telling someone not that close to me about such a thing is pretty hard. And there is the new chain. I, with social anxiety, have to tell a other person i will see the next at least 2 years about me having fucking anxiety. And there my depression plays in that mess. I am scared of tomorrow. of what tomorrow can happen... I'm sure falling asleep tonight is going to be hard. But i have to wake up early. It's clear that i will have a rough start in the day. It keeps building up. Even yet, my hands start getting sweaty just thinking and writing about my mess of a brain, mess of a person, mess of a life.

What else to say...? I already opened the bottle of vodka next to me. Mixed it with some soft drink of my choice... drank about 2 drinks at this point. To calm down. But as you can see, takes much more than 2 drinks, didn't even stopped shaking. Oh boy, i can tell you, my weekend wasn't really reassuring... That's about it. Thanks for reading my shit.

I work in a department store that gets pretty busy during the holidays but is generally pretty okay. It’s been 6 months since I started but every time I’m schedule it still feels like the first day or worse. I’m so nervous and anxious that it physically hurts in my chest and I barely ever get my period anymore. It’s not even a hard job but people in general make me very nervous.

The first thing - I’ve had a semi-professional photography shoot for a project I’m taking part in. I had to meet in a part of the city that was very populated but that I’ve never been to before, with a total stranger but who had been contacted by a trusted person that works with her sometimes. That whole thing went so much better than expected, and I was glowing with confidence afterwards!

Second thing - I had to walk down to my local vets to ask if they can help me with a slight health problem my pet gecko was having. They couldn’t help me directly because they don’t specialise with exotics, but they gave me the contact details of a close exotic specialist vets that would be able to help me.

Finally, the third thing - similarly linked to the second thing - I ****called up**** that recommended specialist vets and got registered there with an appointment booked. Annoyingly, I’m going to have to rebook the time and day because I won’t actually be able to get there for then and I was put on the spot so I blurted out a time and date. However, it’ll be notice enough that it shouldn’t be a problem to rearrange, and the receptionist had told me that if I need to rearrange, to just call - so I’ll sort that out tomorrow.

Ughhhhh. I feel so drained from all these encounters, very tired emotionally, but I feel proud for pushing myself further than I have before, and getting things done. When I get anxious or stressed, I tend to procrastinate to hell and back so I can ignore my feelings (not the most effective solution), so forcing myself to do it sooner rather than later has been a relief to say the least.

I am always convinced that others are judging and whispering about me, thinking that I don't belong there, that I should just go hide in my house because no one needs to see all this.

I'm going to get in shape, anxiety be damned!

596,"I've been dealing with being indecisive for like 3 weeks (it doesn't affect every single decision thoughtout the day though). Plus, recently, I developed something like anxiety while noticing indecisiveness. I'm scared it may be a brain tumor, but doesn't have to as there's a possibility I may be depressed and/or anxious (I'm working on it with a psychiatrist). There's also a chance that these two symptoms can be side effects of my current meds (I'm taking Depakene for fixing mood swings). My psychiatrist said I shouldn't worry about the symptoms, but I still do.

&gt;!No bad headaches, no seizures, no extreme personality changes, no nauseas, no vomitting, no noticable vision changes, etc.  !&lt;Outside of moderate-ish indecisiveness and anxiety-esque thing having a trouble with making a decision, I function pretty much okay. &gt;!I had a blood test done in January and nothing bad was shown on it.!&lt;",1

600,"Hi. 
I'm not sure how common it is for other people, but I have been fainting several times a day over the past week. I have had this issue before, in times of great stress. (ie moving, car accident, loss/gain of employment, etc)

 Months ago, I had to leave work because I was extremely close to fainting and worried I was becoming bradycardic or having some other issue with my heart. I noticed that my heart rate went from low (53bpm was the lowest) to high (85 bpm) when I was usually around 60 - 65. My manager insisted that I went to the hospital or went home.

 My mom was near by so she picked me up and took me. They told me that there was nothing wrong with my heart but it was good that I came in since I took beta blockers for heart palpitations do to anxiety. I struggled for the next few weeks because I still felt faint. 

Then, only a couple months later my boyfriend was in a car accident. I wouldn't walk for 2-3 weeks. I was fainting again. I would sleep for 10+ hours a day for the first week. I went back to a doctor to make sure I was okay. They said i was medically fine. After about a month I was walking again, but had to work part time instead of full time. 

Now, we moved, I started a new medication and was laid off. I faint 3+ times a day if I do anything that remotely causes anxiety. So if I need to leave the house, you can bet that I'm going to faint. I'm sure you can imagine why this makes life difficult. Has anyone else experienced this? If so, is there anything that can help with it? Sorry for the long post.",1
601,"Great news, I think I stopped having sudden anxiety attacks when suddenly thinking about death. Thank you all for advice to preoccupy myself so I don't think about it too much. But now it's paranoia. Hypochondriac? 

My chest hurts for no reason. ""I must have a heart disease"" 
My body's feeling weird ""is it a chronic illness?""
But mostly it's my chest. 

I don't know if it's anxiety or stress or a chronic illness, my chest(left side)  hurts and aches randomly. Mostly before sleeping and I feel like there's something wrong with me? 

I still think I have a chronic illness, it's just at random and less painful? It still makes me break in sweat and afraid to sleep thinking I won't ever open my eyes again. 

I don't smoke, I don't have a high blood pressure(not that I know) there's no possible reason why I would have a heart disease. Except stress? There's exams now but the school doesnt stop the after school activities. Doesn't help that I have an important biannual competition coming up.

I always thought of myself as a jovial person. But last February alone, I've had the most number of mental breakdowns than EVER. To give you an idea, my best friends of three years were shocked when I mentioned that i easily cry when i get emotionally overhwelmed.

This year was the first time ever I revealed problems with friends at school and broke down in front of my family. And I've been in the school dealing with it for 2 years. 

Should I talk to a councillor？I feel reddit is the only place I can talk about this freely. 

And I feel hesitant to talk to the counselor, I'm not that bold and I don't know how to bring this topic up since i've never talked to someone about this as openly on reddit. Also stupid me might get emotionally overhwlemed and break down in front of her. 

Tldr: unsure if stress is causing chest aches which triggered health paranoia. Amounting stress at school makes want to consult a counselor

So I end up ordering food online, and just collecting the trash in the room. Then, when it's time to leave, I don't know what to do.

A couple of years ago when I was in that situation, I went to a random apartment complex and dumped my trash in their trash. This year though, I am staying in a neighbourhood with houses. Last week, I used a public trash bin but it's so small. Now I have so much trash in my room (all in bags, so no smell and no mess) and I'm leaving tomorrow. I'm like on the verge of panicking. Add to that the fact that the host scares the crap out of me. I need a plan to throw everything away. I think I might go to a public park and just dump a little trash in all the bins once the sun is down. 

It's ridiculous y'all. ",1
604,"So today I had one of the worst episodes of anxiety I’ve had for almost 2 years, and I don’t know why. 

It seems like every time I’ve needed to leave my house over the last few days my anxiety sky rockets, sweaty palms, nausea and just a general sense of anxiety and not being able to breathe. 

I’m due to start a new job, which is also a university course in May. I didn’t think I was anxious about this, but maybe it’s what set it off? 

I was supposed to be spending the day with my boyfriend in the town about 20 minutes away, but as soon as I got to the bus stop I had to come home. He came to my house to sit with me and calm me down, which helped massively, and encouraged me to get onto the bus with him. I managed to, but as soon as I got into his town I got super anxious again, nausea, shaking,  dizziness and couldn’t breathe. We stopped in a pub near the bus stop where I called my mum (my saviour) and I decided I needed to go home. 

I can’t thank my boyfriend enough for what he does for me, and today was the first time he’s seen my anxiety this bad. 

I really really don’t want it to get so bad that it reaches the point I can’t leave my house without feeling like this. It’s tiring, and I want to be able to live my life. I like going out, and I like being able to feel happy and content while I’m out. 

If anyone feels like this, please give me some helpful pointers or just encouragement. God knows I need some today. 

Thank you:) ",1
605,"I am sorry if this is the wrong place, but I just needed to put my thoughts down someplace- I am at work, but not wanting to do this with coworkers

A month ago, I learned that my dear son was making suicidal gestures with a rifle.  He had done so in the past including a few times with a loaded rifle.  The last time he did so, he was online with a friend, the rifle was not loaded, but the friend reached out to her mom, then guidance counselor, and then we found out through the school.

Since then, he has been in intensive inpatient therapy, and now is in outpatient therapy.  He is doing well, scaling his days on a better than fair scale.  He says he feels better and behaviorally he is far more engaged with friends and family.  All guns, rifle and ammo were removed and are stored offsite and he does not know where.

Things were moving along fine until about a half hour ago.  I was driving to work and I got images of coming into his room and finding that he had shot himself.  I don't have any specific images, just seeing his body, and blood and the gun.  It is almost as if the enormity of how close we came to losing him, and how oblivious we were to how close we were, is starting to hit me.  This came out of the blue.  I am literally sitting here, typing at work with tears running down my face.

We are also in family therapy- group therapy and all sorts of professional support.  For his sake, we have chosen to not disclose to immediate family as it would also trigger too much drama and interference at this point.

I just have to put this thought here.  And I am going to murder this thought.  I am killing this awful bloody thought.  I am eliminating it from my mind, as much as I can and will not allow it to have a moment further energy.  It didn't happen.  We found out in time.  He is still alive, and he is fighting to survive, and I will him to survive as much as I can.

This is me facing the anxiety, letting the full fear come on, and destroying the thought and replacing with a victory.  Not sure if this will work.

606,"We live in a two bedroom apartment - me, my partner, and his 18 year old son.

It's not my mom actually moving in that has me stressed, it's all the things I suddenly have to do in the next few weeks. We're giving her our bedroom, so we have to relocate our stuff to the living room. This is obviously going to require putting a lot of items in storage and, well , putting our privacy in storage, too.

The amount of work we're going to have to do in the next few weeks has already given me two panic attacks - and I found out yesterday. Plus, I'm stressed because she's obviously stressed and probably embarrassed.

I honestly don't want to get into the details - just wanted to get my feelings out somehow. I love my mom and her living with us isn't going to be a problem - it's the actual preparation and the small window we have to do it in. And, well, how long it could possibly last.

607,"I don't want to get too into the details (although if you look at my past comments I did kind of a big vent this morning on a different thread) but I need to get to an AlAnon meeting. I've needed to for a long time, actually. Maybe a year ago I looked up meetings near me, found one that was a convenient location/time, put it in my calendar, and then didn't go. It was way easier to not go and pretend I didn't really need to, than to deal with the anxiety of a) getting myself there (showing up is a really hard thing for me when I'm feeling anxious), b) what would actually happen in the meeting, and c) what would be the consequences of having gone.

I found a meeting this upcoming Saturday morning that I could walk to from where I live. I'd really like to go, but I'm definitely anxious about having never been before and not knowing what to expect. I'm hoping that if I can hear insights from people who have gone, it'll make me feel a little braver about actually going.

Also, this is no one's responsibility here, but I could use some accountability if anyone wants to help keep me honest about going to this. My IRL support systems are kind of all absent right now.",1
608,"Hey all! 

So I’ve had lifelong anxiety, got much better for a while without medication (not fully but no panic attacks for like 3-4 years except for rarely) and now in the past 6 months got worse again. I went to the doctor and was prescribed Lexapro 10mg which I have been taking for around 4 months now. I also have Xanax as needed. 

My question is about my boyfriend. We have been together for a couple years, and when we first met and for the first year of our relationship I was still in my “lower anxiety” phase. But then in October / November of 2018 I started having daily panic attacks again  and derealization / depersonalization again. After taking the lexapro, it has gotten better but is still pretty bad. And I can tell my boyfriend is pretty upset about it. He hasn’t ever liked it but when it first started happening he was more empathetic and trying to be understanding and worried for me. Now that it has gone on for so long I can tell he’s getting upset at me. He knows it’s something that is extremely hard for me to control, but he said to me today “I just want happy times” and when I asked him to clarify he said it just seems like I can’t ever enjoy anything because of my anxiety (which is true and literally one of my fears— that I will be so scared to live that I wont). 

For example, yesterday was really hard for me but I pushed myself and we went out to a little festival and rode those electric scooters. I really didn’t want to go because of my anxiety, but super glad I went because it was fun and I pushed through! However today, for him he brought up How anxious I was and how I wanted to leave like 20 minutes into us being there. Which I had told him I was feeling anxious and wanting to leave but that I didn’t actually want to and wanted to push through, the wanting to leave was just my anxiety. But based on what he said, he didn’t have as much fun as I did and actually I held him back from having as much fun as he could have. And over time I have seen how I do that because of my anxiety. Even a trip to the mall can sometimes be a hassle because I’m freaking out inside (but I’ll tell him).

So I’m just feeling super down and not sure what to do because I know my anxiety is pushing my boyfriend away but I can’t just get rid of it... although I want it to be gone and I’m trying. What can I do to make him happier? Should I refrain from telling him about my anxiety anymore? And just try to keep it to myself? I don’t want to hold him back from living his life and enjoying it to its fullest especially since he doesn’t have anxiety but I want to also experience things with him i just have such a hard time.

“This is the worst that my anxiety has been in a long time, and it’s really hard to talk about because I don’t want to feel like I’m a bother or constantly being negative.

621,"I had an anxiety attack tonight for the first time in over a year...which in itself is an accomplishment! However, the attack made me realized how stressful some pretty significant things in my life are right now. 

To start, I’m a teacher in one of the worst possible states to be a teacher, Arizona. I hate my administration but a job is a job and I’m working without one of the certifications I really should have through a loophole in the system. I don’t have the certification because I have terrible test anxiety (shocker) and keep failing it. I have plans to keep trying until it is passed but it costs $95 each try.

Next, my hobby is expensive. I own a horse. While I do so in the cheapest way possible, it is a terrible hobby to have with such a low paying job. Without the horse, I’d be pretty lost mentally. I normally have him partially leased out to help with costs but I’ve been unable to find a lessor and It’s been over a year without one...

Lastly, I am having trouble finding a roommate. I had to get out of a bad living situation in a very short period of time and the only place that I found to go where I would feel safe was a few hundred dollars out of my price range. I had a roommate which was helpful but she relocated to a different state for school. Since my rental rate is high the rate to rent my spare room has to reflect that and I know that that is what is keeping people away.

I really should have a second job, as most of my coworkers do.

622,"TW: domestic abuse

I have struggled with anxiety since I was in 4th grade. I caught myself crying over the silliest of things, all the time. It has only gotten worse.

It got really bad when I dated this guy for 5 years. Everything was going great for the first half of our relationship - we were that picture-perfect couple that everyone wanted to be. To keep a long story short, we had a falling out and broke up. We talked everything through months later and decided to get back together. I thought everything would be fine. 

I was dead wrong. 

He started physically abusing me. He started calling me every name in the book. He told me that he was the only person that would ever love me - he convinced me that my mother, my father, my sister, my brothers...all hated me, and it was an “obligation” to treat me right because I’m part of the family and it would be “f**cked up” to blatantly tell me that they didn’t love me. I was fully convinced. And I guess I just haven’t been able to shake it yet. He left me shortly after our 5 year anniversary. 

Now, I am not saying that he is the reason I have anxiety - I was diagnosed with it for far more reasons than this. This just made it that much worse. 

I am now in a relationship of 3 months with this wonderful guy that takes awesome care of me. I couldn’t have asked for anyone better. But I catch myself, almost every night, not being able to sleep from anxiety. Anxiety of him leaving. Anxiety that he just doesn’t love me anymore and questioning who would even love me to begin with. I have talked to him about it once or twice and he has reassured me that I have nothing to worry about, and that he loves me - but I still can’t shake it. I shake, I get nauseous, and I get that lump in my throat that tells me to cry but I can’t. So I just stare at the ceiling and hope it passes. 

I have two best friends that I wouldn’t trade for the world, and I am even convinced that they don’t like being around me anymore. I’ve isolated myself, I’ve stopped answering phone calls from them, I’ve bailed on them. I feel like an awful friend, but I feel like I seriously just can’t freaking help it. I’ve mentioned it to them and they’ve also reassured me that I have nothing to worry about, but it’s like there’s a devil on my shoulder telling me that they’re lying. 

I don’t know how much longer I can keep feeling this way. I need help. I’m struggling.

624,"A cowardly dog is trapped in the corner… all it's life it's been beaten and the only reason it survived was by running away, hiding and whimpering. But now it's cornered, for the first time it can't escape… it now has no choice but to fight viciously for survival. This illustrates the desperate way that our damaged subconscious mind tries to hold on to power and control over us in an attempt to “protect” us and keep us “safe” from harm.
In our childhood the only choice we had was to run, hide or cower in fear. Now, as an adult we have dug deep into the depths of our psyche and we now understand our dysfunction… however, our minds still do not trust us to take control of matters that involve our emotional safety… as a result, it attacks us with convincing arguments that if we try we will fail, there's no point in trying, fighting back leads to pain, give up, run, hide, cower… our minds fill us with fear, dread, anxiety and depression… every and any debilitating emotion to stop us from doing what it feels is dangerous. That is, to confront our fears and try new healthier ways to cope and live. But now our subconscious mind is cornered, there's no way out… you have chosen to refuse to give up, it's you and the cornered animal and only one of you will survive. The problem is, that YOU are the cornered animal, and the only way you walk out is by taming the beast, domesticating it, letting it know that you are in control, letting it know that you are grateful for it keeping you safe the only way it knew how for so many years. But now, YOU are in control and you need to let your mind know that you will protect it now, and that you will not let bad things happen to it again.

Recovery vs Fear of the Unknown 

For those of us with any sort of childhood trauma, fear of the unknown is debilitating. Our childhood trauma taught us that certainty within any given situation is the most important thing. For us, uncertainty was seen as certainty that bad things would happen. Therefore in our lives today, as bad as depression and anxiety is, we are familiar with it… and trying something new,  or trying to do things differently  may fill us with more fear and apprehension, which in turn keeps us trapped in our familiar prison of depression and anxiety.

For me, this is a basic outline of my history.

Initial childhood trauma lasting 18 years.

Maladapted coping mechanisms formed:

•	Denial
•	Suppression
•	Distraction
•	Subjugation
•	Enmeshment
•	Underdeveloped sense of self 
•	People pleasing 
•	Approval Seeking
•	Validation seeking
•	Substance abuse
•	Self pity

After the initial trauma lasting 18 years, it was followed by over 20 years of living a false, people pleasing, codependent identity which ultimately culminated extreme and debilitating depression and anxiety.
For me, recovery meant:

Making a start at refusing to deny, suppress and distract myself from the fact that I have a problem.

Making a start at refusing to be subjugated, people please, approval seek or validation seek.

Making a start at giving myself praise, validation and approval.

My maladapted coping mechanisms of people pleasing, co-dependency, approval and validation seeking all gave me a measure of pleasure and good endorphin release, albeit disfunctionally... therefore, as I started to eliminate maladapted coping mechanisms I started to experience less positive feelings and more stabilized and constant feelings of depression.

Understanding and Acceptance

Once you understand, in as much detail as possible, the precise links between your childhood trauma and your current behaviour and feelings, you might be lucky enough to transform your feelings of depression, anxiety and sadness into anger against the injustice of life itself... anger is a not to be underestimated important step to reach because it is a necessary driver of change... but even then you will not automatically experience joy, peace, calm and happiness... in fact, this type of appropriate anger can and will lead to cynicism, bitterness and resentment, and so it is important to move to the next step in your recovery which is acceptance.

Acceptance.

Acceptance of what happened in your childhood, acceptance of how those things made you who you are today, acceptance that you were and are not to blame for any of it, acceptance that you cannot change the past, acceptance that you are who you are in the now, acceptance that in the now you are the best version of you that you can be... acceptance of the fact that you now have determination to slowly improve your person and your life in frustratingly small steps, every day, day by day, week by week, month by month, year by year... acceptance of the resolve to not give up come what may.

The thing is, most likely, your mind does not know how to feel safe, positive and happy in a normal way. At a default subconscious level your mind will want to revert back to denial, suppression, distraction, a desire to find meaning through enmeshment, self pity and substance abuse or another well established self destructive behaviours. The sad fact is, is that your mind does not yet know how to cope or exist in any other state other than sadness, depression and maladapted and dysfunctional ways of coping and feeling better about things. Therefore it is important to teach your mind new ways to cope with feelings of negativity and new and healthier ways to experience joy, pleasure and happiness... this will present a real challenge for you, because even on a conscious level, you may simply not know how. Initially, you may simply have to go through the mechanical motions of doing things that you know are suppose to make you feel better... like going for walk, doing something artistic, outdoor activities, social activities, listening to music that is happy, not jaded or angry music, or depressing love songs etc.

At times however, we may need to go back and feel the fullness of our pain so as to explore and learn from it, to heal it through resolution... but we cannot live in a state of pain. We may need to revisit feeling angry over the injustices of our life, but we cannot live angry... 

So balance is required, because although we want to live in a happy headspace, this does not mean slipping into denial, suppression and distraction.... it means that we have felt the fullness of our sadness and anger... we accept what we feel, we acknowledge our past and with that acceptance and acknowledgement, we now choose to engage in positive activities to teach ourselves how to be happy in a healthy way.

This being said, the first stage to reach from depression and anxiety is anger, because you are making the switch from flight to fight, but you don't want to stay angry or you will be consumed by cynicism, bitterness and resentment... so you need to move on to the next stage which is resolute acceptance... 

After that you need to establish a new set of personal boundaries, or a realm, or scope of life that you want establish to live within... to find joy within... to find personal fulfilment and meaning and purpose within. Establishing a new life within which you want to live.

Acceptance is important, but it is important to know and get well acquainted with and pursue the healthy things that you want and enjoy in life, that will help you to cope and recover further. 

An important thing to remember is that recovery will not mean that your life will ever be as though your childhood trauma never happened... it will never be how it was before you were debilitated by anxiety and depression... however, just because this may be the case, it does not mean that whatever life you choose to create won't be wonderful.

For me that means pursuing things like art, exercise, weight loss, happy music, lego, movies, gaming, fishing, camping, creativity, appropriate self love and self respect through proper personal hygiene, care, grooming, dress and helping others to better their lives purely for the joy of giving without falling back into co-dependent or people pleasing patterns.

At this stage you may question why? Why bother? You may fear that doing or pursuing these things is ultimately pointless and little more than distracting yourself with positivity. This may be true to a degree, but not entirely, and you will need to be able to recognize that your resistance to pursuing these things amounts predominantly to your own deep seated fear of failure when you try to effect change for the better... your mind may still be trying to hang on to the familiarity of depression and anxiety because it knows how to disfunctionally make you feel better and will always try to pull you back to familiar things to your own detriment because it is convinced that you will be better of with the dysfunction you know, than the uncertainty of doing something new that might fail.

Regret nothing, feel ashamed over nothing, feel guilty over nothing, the past has made you the good and insightful and thoughtful and compassionate person that you are. To regret, feel shame or guilt is to regret that you are who you are, to feel shame and guilt over who you are... which is little more than self hate. Life did not give you the love, nurturing and protection that you deserved... so accept that you are who you are due to a life that was not of your planning and control and was ultimately indifferent, random and cruel.

Armed with this acceptance, move forward and choose to be who you want to be... choose to do what you want to do... choose to live how you want to live... refuse to go on allowing life to happen to you... take charge and become the architect of your future... even if it's hard... even if it's scarey... even though it's unclear whether you will fail or succeed.

But as soon as spring rolls around the heat goes up a few degrees all the techniques I use to help me manage go right out the window. Summer for me is like a living hell for sure. I don't back down from nothing but it does take more effort for me to leave the house when it's hot, anybody else feel this way?",1
627,"I decided to go through my Facebook messages and delete them one by one. I hated the way I used to talk to other people and how I let other people talk to me the way they did. I'm on the brink of having a full blown panic attack but I still kept on going through the messages.

628,"Okay first of all I'm on mobile so the format's gonna be a little weird, and I apologise in advance for any typos. 

I've had anxiety for a while and I've never really done anything to deal with it because I'm too busy with extracurriculars and school. I also didn't tell my parents until recently because they both have a lot of difficulty understanding anxiety and stuff. I told them that I'd been having more  anxiety attacks than normal recently and that I'd been shaking a bunch and it was impacting my school work and stuff (bc I apparently think that's more important than my health). 

My mom thought it was bc I wasn't drinking enough milk and my dad yelled at me for being on my phone too much and giving myself anxiety (which isn't true). 

My parents are both super traditional Indian parents and my older brother is super successful like he's going to graduate college in 2 months and has a nice job lined up and blah blah blah so there's a ton of pressure on me. I think that my parents cause some of my anxiety. Should I tell them this? If so, how do I tell 2 people who don't understand stuff like this that they're causing some of my anxiety? 

To clarify, my mom and dad think that if I tell them everything about myself, my anxiety will go away. Also, when one of my friends almost committed suicide a a few years ago, their only reaction was to ask me why someone would do something that stupid (when they didn't know my friend's circumstances at all). They just don't understand this stuff at all and I really don't know what to do and being at home is stressful and it's basically one long anxiety attack. 

If anyone has any advice that would be amazing, thanks.",1
629,"Just started my second office style job and I've noticed I'm repeating certain behaviours.

""If you are in work, you should work"". This seems to be the best way I've come up with summarising my issue. Everytime I've worked in an office for enviroement I become lazer focused on completing tasks and neglecting everything else. This includes eating, toilet breaks, talking to coworkers, grabbing water. As a result I get in, work, and get out. This probably isn't healthy (physically or mentally), socially I'm isolating myself already, and it's probably also a less effective way to work.

This mindset doesn't just apply to me though. If I see others not actively working on something I become angry, resentful, jealous, ect.

I didn't do anything about obsession with being valuable to my employer before and it resulted me in having referring to a seating plan to see the names of people who were in arm's reach, and overworking myself to the point of getting myself fired.

Ok so this is going to be a long post

I'm a 20 year old Male and I have bad anxiety 
Let's start from the beginning all through my school and college years I have had really bad social anxiety and didnt even realise until it was too late and now I have no one. When I was at college I would be so self conscious when I was doing my work I would never ask for help and would always turn the screen brightness down and angle my laptop so no one could see what I was doing even though I knew no one was watching and when someone was watching i would just completely stop working until they were gone. 
I hate talking about my self and my emotions in fact i hate talking to anyone about anything because i always overthink it and end up saying nothing and not contributing to a conversation. This is often misleading to most people who dont understand me as they just think I'm not interested and have nothing to say when really I have so much to say but by the time I finished going over it in my head it's too late and everyone has moved on. This makes every interaction really awkward especially if it's only me and one other person .
There are a few friends that I feel more comfortable around and will at least engage in a conversation with them however lately most of these people have moved on. So now how am I supposed to meet new people when the few people i feel comfortable around no longer bother with me.
I have only ever discussed my anxiety with one person and only talked about it because he bought it up its like no one else even knows I have anxiety which makes it even more uncomfortable for me.

Lately I've been trying to reach out more but everyone seems to always be busy and I dont want to sound to pushy or desperate so I usually just leave it. I will start typing a message to someone but won't actually send it because I overthink it and even when I am sending a message reaching out to someone I will be going over every word so many times even to the point where one word wont sound right in my head then I will Google the word to make sure it's right even tho I known the whole time  it's right. And it doesn't stop there even after I have sent a message or said something to someone I will be thinking it over in my head. 

After I post this I'm going to be going over it in my head for so long even though I know that it doesn't matter and that no one reading this will care

There is so much more I need to talk about but at the moment its 5am and I need to get some sleep

640,"I am currently on the tail end of my sophomore year of college, my anxiety is still present in my daily life, some days worse than others, but I can manage now. Last year in group therapy, around this time, I gave myself goals that I wanted to achieve. Two of the goals were to get my license, (my anxiety kept me from driving, I felt like I was going to die every time I got behind the wheel) and try to repair my relationship with my parents after I came out to them. One year later and I am comfortably licensed to drive and things are slowly getting better with my parents. I know these seem kinda lame, but I never, ever thought I would be able to do these things. The more coping skills I learn, I feel less and less terrified of the world. Can’t wait to see what next year will bring.",1

643,"Whenever I’ve been in a situation where my boyfriend (of two years) or anyone that I have a relationship (platonic) with gets upset with me I feel the need to isolate myself for days-sometimes weeks and I cry, sometimes over nothing, many times over small things. These things happen and I get so nervous and scared of everything, my mind races but I’m unable to think straight, blaming myself for every little thing even if it isn’t in my control. In my “panic attacks” I start shaking and I feel like I can’t breathe, in those moments I lose control and I want it to stop. I call it anxiety but I don’t want to be inconsiderate to those who deal with the real deal if I don’t actually have anxiety disorder. ",1

I have never really dealt with this before. I just felt so overwhelmed with my new class, the pressure to find a summer internship, my relationship, and just knowing how unhappy I feel at school sometimes just all came crashing onto me I guess. I couldn't stop crying while ft my boyfriend and even today was hard, I was struggling to hold back tears from just everything I guess.

I hope tomorrow is a better day, I went to the gym so that helped a bit.",1
645,"I fought my anxiety and won (mostly)

Now the present is enough. 

It doesn’t matter where I am, I don’t need more than what’s right there. Waiting for a bus? The bench will do. I don’t need my smartphone to escape anymore. I’m enjoying my day.

At home with nothing to do? I can cook a meal with just me and the ingredients. Podcast is optional.

This life is a pleasure cruise. These clouds and trees and people are more than I could ask for.

Without anxiety, I’m free.

Thank you meds, thank you talk therapy.

646,Is it normal to feel derealized when first starting to drive on your own? I recently got my first car and woke up in the middle of the night so anxious for about a week now. I just picked up the car yesterday. I get anxious to drive it. I don’t know if it’s normal and everyone is like this at first or if it’s my anxiety. I take Prozac and it doesn’t help all that much.

647,"Okay so, I've been taking 5mg of Buspirone for 6 months and recently (2 weeks ago) upped my dose to 10mg. I upped it because I was still experiencing panic attacks out of the blue.

It's full blown anxiety attacks in my bathroom at 3 am bad. Can a higher dose of Buspirone cause this to happen or is it too soon to tell?

649,"Not sure if this is the right page to ask this but I’m just wondering what to do.

I’m 18 (female) and have never been kissed or had sex. I had a boyfriend in middle school but I never did anything with him and we didn’t spend any time together and eventually broke up. I haven’t dated anyone since. I don’t think I’m ugly or boring but I’m definitely not perfect.

I really want a boyfriend, to have my first kiss and lose my virginity, etc. So I can get over the fear that I’ll be a virgin and alone forever. I feel so stupid to worry about these things but all I can think about these days are how I’ll probably be alone forever.

I got a few dating apps but I got stood up on the first time I agreed to meet with someone which really screwed my self confidence up. I also hate eating around others in fear of looking gross. I went on another date and when he tried to kiss me, I chickened out because he was older than me and I’m also worried that I will be bad at kissing. The next date I went on I thought went okay, but he stopped texting me. I still have tinder and chat with people occasionally but am too afraid to meet up.

I honestly have no idea what to do about this. I feel really stressed about this. please give suggestions on ways to move on from these worries.",1
650,"I’ve been in a rut with severe depression and anxiety for the past decade, which is nuts considering I’m 17. I’ve tried all the regular methods, meditation, working out, trying a ton of new thing etc etc etc. Basically everything but intimate relationships or sex because of a shitty feedback loop where I don’t try because of anxiety and self loathing, and have the anxiety and self loathing surrounding it because of my inexperience. 

So I’ve tried resorting to substances recently. Not the best choice I know, but i don’t know what else to do. By this point I’ve used plenty of stims, not a lot of benzos, alcohol, and I have a nicotine addiction. Of course like any teenager, I’ve tried weed a lot before. My first time I think was in 8th grade with my first stoner friend, felt tingly and happy for a lil bit and went on my merry way. 

In the past 2 years though, weed seems to mess with me a lot more than anything else has. It’s been a gradual change but I don’t use it enough to see any actual data like that. But anyways I’m gonna try to explain my recent experiences as well as I can. Note that it might be dramatic, acting like I was experiencing some Aztec ritual type shit, but I really am explaining it as truthfully and as well as I can:

So it starts out right after I take a hit. The top of my mouth and tongue start to go to a tingly numb. Over the next 30 minutes this feeling consumes my whole body. Meanwhile, my mind starts slowly racing, I overthink heavily each action and thought I have to the microscopic level to the point that I’m metacognating on my metacognition each second. It’s still fine, I think it’s fun. My thoughts are now synced to a beat, if I’m listening to music it goes along with the beat, if not I have some weird ambient sounds in my head that I have no idea where they come from. Still all good.

Then it gets bad. The beat isn’t only in my thoughts, I’m having twitches and my shoulders or torso jerk with every other beat. Then I start to get an intense feeling creeping towards my spine and I start to go cross eyed. I start thinking about the last time this happened but I block it out, this time will be good and fun. But it doesn’t take long to submit that I’m not  feeling good anymore. 

Then my thoughts go out of control. I start to think about *everything.* and really, *everything.* I uncover old memories from my early childhood up to now, bouncing around back and fourth. But I can’t actually tell you what those memories entail, maybe they pass to quickly, or maybe they aren’t even real.!The real kick is though that each quarter second memory has a specific unrelated visual in my head and an emotion tied to it, the emotion I guess is the one tying them together. I can’t explain the emotion for the same reason I can’t explain the memory. But it gets super intense. Some are happy, some are sad, some are scary or dreadful. Basically every feeling in the book. It can get dark, one thought that stuck out to me was that I was just meant to kill myself from the start, like a prophesy was made for me, and less than a second later I knew I was destined to be a legendary guitarist.

Then that intense feeling I mentioned before starts to get a lot more intense. And it’s now rushing through both my spine and my brain, and eventually all of my nerves. It gets more and more tingly until it starts to just feel really painful. Like an overload of adrenaline or dopamine. But I have no idea what it is. 

About an hour and a half in both start to max out and I either throw up or power through it and fall asleep. 

And then that’s it.

Again like I said, super dramatic, but it’s the best I can explain it without leaving anything I can think of out. This doesn’t happen every time either. And it’s not correlating to the amount I use. So that just adds to the confusion.

I really don’t do it often, but every time I do I’ve gotten a growing sense of paranoia and abnormality. I’ve never seen or heard of anyone having these experiences. I don’t feel like my brain is functioning correctly. I want to try more psychedelics like lsd and psilocybin, but after these it’s made me wary. 

What is this? What do I do?",1

659,"-this is my first reddit post it’s probably terrible-
When i can tell anxiety is anxiety i can ignore it (like if i’m scared to go to the first day of class) but sometimes when the anxiety comes from a very real danger it’s hard for me to tell if it’s anxiety or a bad feeling i should listen to. This happens to me every time i want to go to the gym at night, i keep thinking someone is going to take me in the parking lot or something and i mean that could easily happen so it’s hard for me to tell if it’s a “warning feeling” or anxiety. I think it’s important to pay attention to your intuition if you have a bad feeling about something BUT i keep listening to my anxiety because i’m scared it’s my intuition. 
I’m pretty sure it’s just anxiety because it happens every time i want to go to the gym at night and when i do go i don’t get taken but i keep thinking “what if THIS time i should listen to it bc it’s real?”

I don't know from where this change comes from, but I like it and I feel happy and alive, and I haven't felt this way in a long while and I don't like this feeling going away. ",1

I’m starting to feel pathetic and panicky. Wtf is wrong with me :( ",1
667,"I'm in my first year of university. I just had to give a 7 minute presentation in my college Sociology class. This is the first presentation I had to give in my college career. I was so nervous. When my name got called to present, the nerves got so bad.

As I went up in front of the class to present my powerpoint, I began shaking profusely. I started sweating and my voice got shaky. I knew they could tell I was nervous from how they were looking at me. They were looking at me like I was crazy.

When I finished, they appluaded nonetheless. A few students had to do a peer review for each student that presented. One person did a peer review for me. For each student you had to write something they needed to improve on.

For my improvement, she wrote ""Relax a little bit."" That kind of hurt me because she noticed I was nervous.

I felt terrible after giving that presentation. I always hated public speaking.

To make matters worse, we have to give another final presentation that's going to be 15 minutes.

I'm thinking about just not showing up for it.

What do you guys think?",1

I also get nausea, hot flushes, lightheadedness, panic, worst case scenario thoughts etc.

I’ve came home early from college twice this week cause of it, which pisses me off as my attendance is pretty much impeccable. 

Been to the doctor and had blood tests, waiting for them to come back, also going to the doctor this Wednesday for the shortness of breath.

681,"Hi guys,

I have been struggling with a fear of Schizophrenia for the past few weeks and today I noticed feeling multiple sensations around my body. Some of these sensations feel like tingling, itching, stress going through my back and on the occasion, bugs crawling through my skin (this lasts for a few seconds). I have been doing a lot of reading about Schizophrenia, and I read about the tactile hallucinations and now I am wondering if I am having it.  

I had the Bach's Rescue Therapy pastille as well as two tablets of NuLife Theraputics Sunshine Therapy (it contains items such as Vitamin D, St Johns Wort, Vitamin B3 and B6 and others). I was wondering if taking these tablets triggered  or could trigger the onset of Schizophrenia. I have also been taking Vitamin D (1 tablet), Omega 3 for the past week daily. At the same time, I have to wonder if this is my anxiety causing symptoms, or my use of the tablets causing symptoms. I am just very worried, and at the same time I am not hearing voices or seeing things that are not there.",1
682,"Hi everyone! So...I’m trying to write this as coherently as I can, and I hope it all makes sense lol. They’re all undiagnosed, but I know I have generalized/social anxiety and OCD. My mind constantly runs amok, and I fear the worst will happen, to the point of exhaustion, especially about things like social interactions, even just run of the mill stuff. My body is always so tense, my heart rate is always so fast, I’m tired so often, and I’m taking nexium everyday for heartburn. Also, I think my hair is falling out more often than usual, which is an indication of severe anxiety, I think. Overall, I just feel very stuck, like everything seems so hard. 

I’m a college senior set to graduate in a few months, and I just...haven’t been looking for jobs or internships or anything because the prospect of interviews really scares me, like I can foresee me messing up horribly. Over winter break, my parents started nudging me along in regards to potential jobs/internships, like suggesting I apply for this and that, and I would kind of start to avoid them because all that just scares me. They then told me they didn’t understand why I was so resistant to talking about after college stuff, so I kind of broke down and told them that I’m afraid of interviews and working with people! I told them I get so anxious about things, and sometimes I feel very sad about how anxious I get. And they seemed to understand. My mom said “Well, maybe you need to talk to someone”, like therapy. The concept of therapy kinda scares me, but I know it would make me feel better. My dad was really sympathetic and said that it’s okay that I don’t know what to do in regards to after college stuff, and that I’ll figure it out. All in all, at the end of winter break, I felt better because I told them about how I was feeling. I guess I had this idea that after graduation, I could go to therapy and figure things out from there. We didn’t really talk about me having anxiety though after that; I think we just didn’t want to address it? Idk

But then I came home for spring break and my mom starts asking me about jobs and stuff. I was taken off guard and said “oh I thought we said I could talk to someone first...” and she said something like “is it really that bad? I get anxious too. Everyone gets stressed out sometimes.” My mom has always been saying stuff like that when I try to bring up anxiety—that everyone gets nervous, it’ll pass. She attributes my bad anxiety and heartburn to me working on my senior thesis, and that when I’m done with it, I’ll feel better. Sure, thesis writing has exacerbated my anxiety, but it’s by no means the only cause. I just don’t know how to make them understand that I have a disorder. I’m also kind of ashamed that I have bad anxiety, that it ruins relationships for me, and that I’m really lonely sometimes because of it. Overall, it’s really frustrating, and I just feel so stuck. 

My parents are the best parents in the world, and I’m grateful that they want to help me in regards to after school plans. I also realize that their alarm towards me not actively looking for jobs is more that justifiable. I just wish I could make them understand easier. Sorry this is so long, but this is really the first time I’ve went in depth with how I’ve been feeling. Any advice is much appreciated. ",1

687,"TL;DR ""What are the preparations you take when your engaged to face a major exposure excersize?""

Hiya!

Next week I got a major exposure 'event'.
In an earlier post I mentioned my dad is having pancreas surgery out of town. 
(1 hour drive from home) 
My mother, sister + husband, and I are going to be around him for support. 
We booked an hotel room for 2 nights. 
I'm extremely nervous and full of anxiety. Already. 

Because the surgery is not a choice, my presence neither is. 
This is a thing I have to do, an exposure I can't escape. 
My fears aren't really about the surgery, because the surgeon is very capable, he is going to use a newtech robot assistance and the tumor they are going to remove hasn't proven to be cancer for 100% certainty. (My dad did have three surgeries before. All of them removing cancer tumors. Those were in his colon and two times liver, so luckily they aren't taking any risks on the development of this found spot on his pancreas)
I'm more afraid of being out of my comfort zone, outdoors, visiting the hospital, feeling claustrophobic, or afraid I have to vomit and can't find a toilet nearby. It's about sleeping in a hotel, or getting myself into panic attacks, and not being able to calm down. Or the fear no one can calm me down, and that I remain in the panic attack and it will drive me out of control. Get into a mindset of despair and hopelessness. 

And being afraid of being the extra emotional weight my family has to carry around while we're already at the top of emotional tolerance...

So! I need to prepare myself as good as possible!
Does anyone have any tips regarding preparation for exposures? 
- I'm gonna try to be rested and relaxed as possible this week. So that my body can handle the adrenaline. 
- I'm going to exercise a bit. Don't have a any condition, won't have it either in a week time, but you know, dust a bit off, clean the rust in my joints, stretch out and get this 'tank' body moving...
- I was thinking about writing down some motivational quotes
- get a simple mantra going
- I am going to drink more water
- Meditate some more
- rewire the breathing patterns. Self awareness in breathing
- already carrying plastic bags folded in my jeans in case I need to vomit (it gives me a bit more confidence)
- already bringing down the daily dose of Lorazepam I take each day, so it will be more effective next week in case I need to increase the dose because of anxiety.
- already got my music in Spotify on my phone. My favourite band Nirvana, grunge, stoner, noise and alternative rock but also soft rock in case the hard rock makes me more pumped up.
- gonna take some new photos of our two cats so I can look at them whenever I want. As mascottes.
- gonna search for some easy literature to read. 
- taking a notebook in case I get inspired and I want to write
- buy a powerbank for my phone (because it's also gonna be my TV if I want to watch anything
- gonna do a nofap this week until I'm back home, because of post orgasm sickness (also did post about this earlier)


Any more tips? For some trust and confidence and getting in the right mental state? Because I'm really trembling from time to time already, hahaha. Oh, and I hate food and eating (it's wired with the fear of vomiting (nothing in, nothing out) so that has always been an issue in my life. Even though I'm fat (give it up for anti depressants!!))

Thanks in advance!!

688,"I need to get this off my chest because its been bothering me since 2002 and I’ve developed general anxiety disorder because of it. You know the dinner scene from “Signs”? 

Mel Gibson and Joaquin Phoenix know the Aliens are invading, so the family sits down for one last meal. Joaquin Phoenix’s character says “I’ll make some sandwiches”, okay that sounds simple and easy. The young child instead says “I want spaghetti”, okay that’s a little extra work but nothing difficult. Mel Gibson then asks each family member what they want to eat. *Uh oh*.. 

The girl wants *Spaghetti*

The boy wants *French Toast with mashed potatoes*

Joaquin Phoenix wants *Chicken teriyaki*

Mel Gibson wants a *Cheeseburger with extra bacon* 

At this point I’m already picturing the nightmare going on in the kitchen. All that food, all that mess. It’s stressful enough that aliens are invading. Now you have to prepare and cook 4 different large meals!? Where did Mel get the chicken for the teriyaki? the beef for the burgers? the sauce for the spaghetti? the taters for the mash? did Mel already have all the ingredients for this extravagant feast? 

And the shit really hits the fan when they sit down and no one is even touching their food! Seriously? We just spent 3 hours cooking four different meals and nobody’s gonna eat? All that work for nothing. Just let the aliens in the house. I need a Xanax. ",1
689,"I've felt this for a long time, and I wanted to ask if others felt this way.

The best way for me to describe it would be an example.

Let's say I want to start reading more, or start playing the guitar. I have other anxiety problems related to starting new hobbies, but one big one is that I am scared of being seen doing something different for some reason. I don't want comments to me, good or bad. I don't even want people to THINK about me doing something new or different. I'm very lucky in that my family doesn't give me bad comments, but I can't even handle GOOD comments.

Why do I defeat myself like this. I sit in my room all day besides for work, but I'm terrified of doing anything to change it.

If you need more examples I can explain further.

edit: /u/dnicky brought something up that I really liked.

&gt;For me it's not just when I'm doing something new, it's when I'm doing something new that I really, truly care about. Almost as if - if people knew how much I cared about it - they'd know too much about me.

I ended up taking only .5 of my usually 1mg anxiety med, we went to my house to get a few things done and on the way home he stopped to get gas. I was feeling kinda anxious and I decided to just go inside and get us some waters (the worst that happens is I put them back and leave and he has to go inside and get them instead?) and then I was so proud of myself. 

THEN he was going to go right home and I realized I’m always starving at his house and he knows I absolutely cannot do the grocery store. But I said “I want XYZ things” and I went inside the store, grabbed a few things (he even wandered off in another direction) AND I browsed stuff I knew I didn’t need for a couple minutes and then went and paid! 

To top this all off, I have a very hard time eating more than a few bites at a time without anxiety telling me I’m gonna puke and I don’t feel well etc etc. anyway, he said “pick a food” and I said “burgers” and we went through a drive thru and when I got home I ate an entire double cheeseburger in one go. I know to a lot of people that’s a normal meal or quick thing but I can’t remember the last time I cleared my plate, let alone didn’t have anxious thoughts the entire time.

698,"I'm a 48 y.o. gay male, and my whole life has been bound up in severe depression and anxiety.  After a severe bout of suicidal ideation a little more than 2 years ago, I did seek out professional help and was diagnosed with major depressive disorder with anxious distress.  I was referred to psychiatrist and am now on Wellbutrin and Buspar for the depression and anxiety.  While it's helped a lot, I've also learned on my own how to avoid sinking into severe depression - I can spot the symptoms early, and just the awareness doesn't really do much for the moodiness, it does help keep me from taking it personal, if that makes any sense.

The anxiety is another matter altogether.  From my armchair quarterback viewpoint, I can see that I've always had it, and outside of a few exacerbating incidents, I didn't realize it was a problem until I started getting my depression under control - which apparently was masking a lot of more overt symptoms.  Within a couple of weeks of being on a new anti-depressive med, i had a full blown panic attack that had no external triggers whatsoever ... the first time that had ever happened to me.

There are a lot of environmental things in my current life that make things bad for me, and I've worked on that a lot with my therapists.  I seem stuck though.  I'm always angry.  I'm tense all the time.  My blood pressure will spike at any moment at the least trigger.  At work, my desk has to face the door because if I don't hear someone walk up on me, I will jump or fall out of the chair and scream - which is extraordinarily embarrassing.  I scream when my husband walks up on me unawares.

My first therapist was mostly focused on my current issues, and when I brought up the possibility of me possibly having PTSD, she seemed a little irritated, and seemed to act as if I was trying to find a way to get on disability (I'm not - I enjoy working and being productive).  Because my panic attacks were causing missed work (it was also a very hostile working environment), she happily signed FMLA paperwork for me so I wouldn't get fired, thinking that had solved the problem.

When I changed therapists (due to an insurance change), she seemed a lot more intellectual, however was equally as dismissive to me having PTSD, and verbally expressed concern about how my education (I'm a master's prepared nurse educator) may be influencing my questions (essentially worrying that I might be a well-versed hypochondriac).

I certainly don't have all of the symptoms, and I'm not trying to compare myself to people who've been severely raped or suffered major psychological damage due to things they've seen in the military service of my country. I don't have have flashbacks or nightmares or memory loss, but I do experience a lot of the other symptoms . ... irritability, reckless behavior, addictive behaviors, exaggerated startle response, problems with concentration, withdrawal, detachment, etc.

My past - in the 70's, I was a very feminine young boy (we called them ""sissies"" back then) who was raised in a small southern mill town and attended a Pentecostal church ... and later went to a church school at the same church.  The bullying was more than just severe name-calling and harrassment (though there was plenty of that), but also getting beat up frequently - physical altercations occurred 2-4 times a month and forced simulated sex, usually in front of others in my class. 
 There was always the possibility of it happening since I was generally too depressed to ever fight back.  The one time I did fight back, me and the other boy were corporally punished.  Adults never did anything about it - ""boys being boys"" was generally.  When not at school, I was generally in my room at home with the door locked, trying to protect myself from a very cruel world.  Suicide was always on my mind, and I matriculated from that world as someone with zero self-esteem.

But, I wasn't raped, or at least I don't remember it.  I didn't experience war-time trauma, and again - I'm not ever wanting to discount anything anyone has experienced that was worse.  I just want to know if I'm the only one that feels like this, and if there's the possibility that this high panic state I stay in 24/7 until I pass out is something that could be PTSD?  I know I need a new therapist, but I'm really scared of starting over again and getting an identical response.",1
699,"Hi all, I've been thinking more and more that it might be good if I see a counsellor for what I think is anxiety or FOMU, which I think it is starting to affect work life. I have a friend whose going and its kind of making me think it might be good for me to.


The thing is this is really ugh for me, I've never been open to anyone, not even immediate family (besides anonymous people on reddit). It feels so odd to see my brother talk to my mum about an issue he's going through, and I just can't do the same.


I was thinking of maybe writing down why i think I have anxious tendencies, what I want to work on, and go from there? Or do I let the person take the lead? It sort of only occurred to me recently the person probably won't actually be able to guess why I'm there unless I explain it haha. Would love to hear how things have been for you?",1
700,"Obviously I don't snap extremely loud, but I've noticed lately that when I get a sudden/rapid wave of anxiety or intrusive thoughts, I'll end up snapping my fingers (sometimes more than once in a sitting). I guess it could be a nervous tic? 

I do try to control the urge to do this, but I do notice that I will end up snapping my fingers when I am hit with a sudden wave of anxiety or general worries. I think this has been occurring for the past few months at least. ",1
701,"Hi! I’m 25 (F) and I’ve been diagnosed with GAD for 9 months but have pretty much had it my whole life. I’ve been in therapy since I got diagnosed. It helps a whole lot and I’ve gotten a lot better at managing my anxiety in almost every field except when it comes to my boyfriend. We’ve dating for a little over a year and I can’t remember a time that I’ve haven’t been anxious about him, except when we almost broke up. Then I felt very in love and secure about everything for a good month or two.

But other than that I often randomly get anxious about him. I could be having a good time and feeling great and out of nowhere I get very anxious and I feel it in my chest and I don’t know why. Then I start digging for a reason and start questioning whether or not I actually have feelings for him, whether or not he’s the one and whether or not i really want to be with him. Sometimes it gets to the point where I start telling myself that I’m not even attracted to him, that he’s ugly and that I want to be with someone who’s more attractive. 

He’s honestly the sweetest, nicest, most amazing and patient person I know. (Apart from my mom). So it’s so shallow of me to think that way. And he’s not ugly at all. He’s pretty cute actually. But these are the thoughts I usually have. Sometimes at those moments i also can’t remember any positive thing about him. And every tiny thing he does, starts annoying me. 

We also have this issue where either HE feels like he has to hold in his feelings to make sure I’m okay when I’m anxious about whatever thing or I’M the one trying to make sure he doesn’t find out that I’m anxious so he doesn’t feel like he needs to hold in or so that I don’t bring his mood down by being negative. And we can’t seem to find a way to better this issue. So that also sucks. Because every now and then he has to tell me that he’s feeling bad again because of me and that I’m bringing down his spirits by being anxious and him not being able to help me. Which I understand completely. But as a result i start holding it in which then makes me annoyed with him and makes me distance myself from him. I only recently realized that I do this and told him and he was very sweet and nice about it and I felt better afterwards. We even agreed that it’s probably better if we break up to give us both a break but we don’t want to because we love each other. 

This conversation happened a few days ago. And previously he’s already told me twice that he doesn’t know if this (us) is what he wants because of the issue i described above. And every time we have a conversation like this, I get very insecure and start being more affectionate and mushy gushy towards him and don’t feel anxious about him either. But the second I realize we’re okay again, I start getting anxious. Like just now, we were hanging out in his car for a few minutes and everything was totally fine and I was happy everything was alright again and I suddenly got anxious while we were kissing. And it confused me. As usual. I just don’t know why this keeps happening. I feel like, maybe it’s because I want to be 100% sure that he is the one for me and that there is no one better out there for me. But this is obviously impossible. I constantly go back and forth from absolutely not wanting to break to not being sure if I want to be with him and not knowing whether  I have feelings for him or not. And also thinking that he’s ugly and that I want someone who’s more attractive. 

WHY? And how do I stop this? Does anyone have any advice? Because I don’t want to keep feeling this way. It’s so exhausting. Not only for me but also for him. 

I also feel like I will never be happy if this pattern keeps continuing and that’s incredibly upsetting. ",1
702,"So a bit of backstory last year my dad's liver failed and though he recovered and managed to quit drinking it was the catalyst of this over-bearing paranoia that everyone i know is going to die. just a few weeks ago my mom got diagnosed with breast cancer and though its most likely treatable and not life-threatening. both events happened around the same time in the year, only about a year and a day apart. Now every time one of them coughs or looks a little tired i get this subtle yet present feeling that this could be it, and ive had several surreal and uneasy nightmares wherein im telling them last words and ill wake up in tears and the bed covered in sweat.

Fantasising about how my book, show will fail and everything that is wrong with it. “It’s already been done” “YouTube is saturated now wtf you doing lol “ “Imagine your friends found out about this haha”

I’ve started multiple creative avenues. Blogs, apps, social media pages and YT channels all failed (deleted because I thought I’m not good enough)

I started a podcast recently (anxiety made this podcast) and got 100 downloads so far.

Things that have helped me are:

1) I have to feel the podcast. I can’t set a time when to make an episode or I won’t stop thinking about it, I have to do it on a whim.

2) Not listening back to my episodes. My quality of sounds will suck but I would probably delete the episode out of cringe.

3) No one IRL knowing. 

4)Putting the pen to paper is easier than thinking about it. You have to get into the arena to fight the gladiator.

Any other creative types in here with anxiety,

709,"My boss asked me if I wanted to do the register. Like an idiot, I said yes. But then a few seconds later I started getting really nervous. I went to the bathroom to breathe a little. (don’t worry, the store wasn’t open yet so it didn’t have any bad smells haha) Then I told her that I changed my mind. But she was like “Nooo you thought about it too long. You can do it.” But I really can’t. So then I started freaking out. What if I do things wrong? What if a customer cusses me out? What if I have a breakdown right then and there? So then 2 days later, my aunt asks if I’m okay. I say no and start crying. I vented. She tried to give me bullshit beliefs. By that I mean she said “Maybe if you do the register, your fear will fall away.” No. That’s not how my mind works. I told her that it makes sense but I failed to tell her that it genuinely puts me into a state of physical and mental angst. I’ve been like that ever since I was a kid. On picture day, my knees would shake. My aunt thinks that by doing things that make me uncomfortable, I’ll somehow get anxiety out of my head. Hell. No. I tried it and it’s only self harming me. It’s like walking on sharp glass and saying to yourself, “This is okay. I’m not being hurt. This will only make me stronger.” I don’t know how but I’m going to tell her that I won’t do it.

710,"Hoping to find some advice on how to relax. Also looking for reassurance that everything will be okay. It is a bit of a long winded story, so feel free to skip down to the TLDR!

So I'll try to keep this as short as possible. I (F25) ate lots of sweets as a kid, skipped some nights of brushing my teeth, and started to grind my teeth when I was in college a couple of years ago. I wore a mouth guard on some nights to try to combat it. 

I went to the dentist back in the summer of 2017 after not going for 2 years. They told me I had taken some damage from grinding my teeth. I expected it. I was hoping there would only be cavities, but I was told I needed a root canal w/ a crown on a molar. They did it that summer, and did another root canal w/ a crown on another molar of mine half a year later in January 2018. I needed time to save money for other teeth they saw problems with. Fast forward to January of 2019, they crown another of my molars (no RCT on this one). I was told I needed another tooth crowned. I was so distraught at the news. I told them I was going to seek a second opinion from another dentist.

I visited another dentist about 2 weeks ago. He did a full oral examination of my teeth, telling me which cavities needed to be retouched a little. Nothing big. He then did an x-ray of my teeth and informed me the first root canal I had done a year and a half ago hasn't healed yet. He also told me the crown I had done recently back in January of this year is not a good fit and is bulky (This could explain the pain I was feeling from this tooth for the past two months, sensitivity to cold drinks and hurts when biting down on food).

I am mostly just looking for the light at the end of the tunnel here. My main concerns are that my root canal doesn't heal properly and will have to be retreated (more money and more pain). If that doesn't work, it would have to possibly be extracted and I'd have to get an implant (tons of money). The crowned tooth that is hurting me right now would have to be potential recrowned. If that doesn't work, I'd have to get another root canal... 

I know it's not the end of the world. I'm lucky I can save up enough money for the treatments I need now. But I am so stressed about how much more I could potentially spend on my teeth. I'm worried about all my root canals failing in the future and needing to replace them all with implants. I am just so worn down, and my thoughts are constantly about my teeth. ""Will I be okay? Will the root canal heal? Do I really need more of these?? When will they fail? Will my other cavities turn into crowns and root canals?"" Every day I am online looking at dental forums and reaching out to dentists, asking for answers. My anxiety is on full blast as I'm stuck in the middle of all of these procedures. My mind hates not knowing what is to come. I am thinking of the ""what ifs"" and am creating worst case scenarios in my head...

But amidst my thoughts, I realized I also needed to vent and to have a good cry as I type this out. If you fully read this, I can't thank you enough. This is what has been on repeat in my brain for the past couple of months. I've been crying everyday as soon as I get off of work. My anxiety has been terrible. My body has been so tight. My throat gets a bump in it that I can't burp away. I can't catch my breath. If anyone has any advice on how I can be positive, how I can try to get my mind off of everything, or if you've been in a situation like this before, I would love to hear from you. Even if it's just a simple ""feel better"", it would help me immensely. Thank you.


TLDR; I have had two root canals w/ crowns done, have a crowned tooth, and have a couple other cavities. Was recently told one of the root canals is not healing well, and that my crowned tooth might have to get recrowned or have a root canal done on it. I'm stressed out about not knowing what will happen. I'm low on funds. I'm so anxious.",1
711,"I used to have just terrible anxiety. Terrible. In the past year, it seems to have subsided, but three years ago, I got a hearing test, because I noticed it didn't seem as acute, and I had constant tinnitus. The testing came back as significant hearing loss. I questioned this immediately, because according to the testing methodology, I had very little hearing, yet I could converse just fine, albeit with issues in the car, etc. They gave me hearing aids and sent me on my merry way. Since then, I notice my hearing doesn't seem nearly as bad anymore in one ear. According to all lore, this is impossible, which makes me wonder if it was psychosomatic because of the anxiety, and this makes me nervous to ever need hearing tests again because they'll see a discrepancy and accuse me of something.

Have any of you experienced hearing changes with your anxiety?",1
712,"I posted about this awhile ago and didn’t get much response.  I’m hoping to get some advice! 

I know that I tend to overthink and over analyze EVERYTHING.  So I’m aware that most of this is in my head... I could still use some advice! 

I struggle with having social anxiety ever since I was with my abusive ex.  We were together for almost 6 years and broke up 4 years ago. I thank god every day that I was strong enough to get out of that relationship but the effects of the abuse are still on the forefront of my every day life.  He led me to believe that every conversation or interaction I had with others was pathetic and he criticized everything that I said and did.   I was selfish and stupid and no one liked me (his words not mine).  Before dating him, I would have considered myself an extrovert.  

Once we broke up I thought I’d go back to my outgoing and friendly self without any issues.  Boy was I wrong.  I find myself avoiding every social situation and when I talk to others I’m constantly filtering what I’m saying or I worry about how I came across after the conversation. I’ve become EXTREMELY introverted to the point that I almost always decline invitations to social events as I am overcome with crippling anxiety at the idea of it. 

I don’t have many close friends as I’ve grown apart from the friends I grew up with.  I moved out of state with my ex after a year or so of dating so the only friends I had nearby where his friends.  After our breakup I literally had no one.  

I finally got a steady job and made a close friend at work.  We were close until we both got different jobs.  Honestly, we started growing apart maybe a year before that when she and another friend we worked with both had their kids.  I felt like they got closer and I wasn’t a part of the “club” so I got left out of certain things.  

Anyway, her and I have been struggling to keep in touch.  I feel like it’s very one sided with me constantly being the one that has to reach out. More recently, she forgot my birthday.  My one close friend forgot my damn birthday.  Meanwhile I attend every birthday party for her son and was the first one to wish her happy birthday this year.  

I know I shouldn’t keep score but it the reality of it is, I’m just not as important of a friend to her as she is for me.  We haven’t talked seen each other in person for months and have maybe texted twice in the last month or so.  She did send me an invite to her son’s birthday party recently and honestly, I don’t want to go.  It’s an hour away and I know how she operates at those kinds of events. I’ll be lucky if I even get two minutes to talk to her. 

I know I’m probably overthinking it and I was going to bring it up to her, but I avoid conflict like the plague.  I do want to let her know that I was hurt about her forgetting my birthday and that the lack of communication and effort on her part makes me feel awful. 

This is a tough age.  I’m 32 and I’m beginning to realize that the majority of my friendships have been lost to marriage or motherhood.   In reality, I know those relationships obviously weren’t as strong as I thought they were otherwise they wouldn’t fizzle out so quickly.   I know plenty of people who are married and have kids that have managed to maintain friendships so I know it can be done.   It just feels like it’s a club that everyone else is in, and because I’m not married or have kids, there’s no reason to include me in things. 

Aside from the specific friend issue, I want to learn how to be more social and to stop worrying about what others think.  I want to finally make more friends and get my social life back.  I just don’t know how to make friends. When I was younger it was easy because I met people at school.  I’ve tried to make friends at my job and have made one kind of close friend, but she never wants to hang out and now she’s pregnant with her first child.  She assured me she’d still be around after having her daughter but time will tell.  Plus she has a close group of girlfriends and I feel like I’m just her work acquaintance.  She’s also very flaky and will often interrupt me during conversations or will ignore me when other coworkers are around. 

I’ve thought about using bumble BFF or another app to find girlfriends but it feels awkward.  I found my bf on tinder which is great but it feels weird being on an app looking for friends.  I honestly feel like somethings wrong with me. 

Any advice on how to approach the issue with my friend or how to go about making friends is much appreciated!  I know that a lot of my issues stem from my anxiety and depression issues.  I know that I need to work though those as well.  ",1

714,"I hope this is the right subreddit to ask this but I guess I just need some advice. I feel so anxious &amp; insecure around seemingly everyone. The anxious &amp; insecure part of me is always comparing myself to others and it always results in me being brought down &amp; giving up. I get so discouraged so easily and it's easier to tell myself to give up and that I suck at whatever Im doing rather than to push through. What do I do in those times where the anxiety of not being good enough &amp; failing gets the best of me?

I have a girlfriend and I love her so much, but she's so much more motivated than I am and it sucks because I can't help but compare myself to her. We're both in our first year of college but she's graduating in two years while I'm graduating in four. We talked last night and she mentioned that she needs to be going at a faster pace than everyone else. I know it's not that she wants to better than anyone, it's just the pace she wants to be at intrinsically. It just sucks when my first thought is ""damn, I'm such a dumbass because, if I'm lucky, I'm going at the normal pace"" I never give myself any credit &amp; I'm proud of few things, if any.

I don't want my first reactionary thoughts to be those of insecurity and jealousy. It's the same thing with my friends. I don't want to feel that. I support the hell out of them and I want to be able to without being nervous of them nonintentionally putting me down.

I'm sorry if this is kind of a disjointed rant, I can elaborate further if anyone asks but I guess I just want some advice if that's cool by you guys. ",1
715,"Last night around midnight there was a knock at the door- we are in an apartment complex and it’s not unheard of for a neighbor to knock due to an issue.  However, I looked through the peephole and it was a lady I didn’t recognize, a skinny white lady.  I opened the door and kept my shoulder on it in case it was trouble; she immediately launched into a scatterbrained tank about needing to borrow a phone- I said “hold on” and closed the door and relocated it.  I asked my wife what she thought ( she was sitting on a couch in the living room where the door is), she just shrugged.  I turned off the lights and went silent- she hung around the door a few minutes and then left.

Hello, hope everyone is doing well--spring is here, you best be doing well ;)! Today I'm looking for advice about how to handle abandonment issues. Long story short, I had a really chaotic upbringing and its left a toll on my adult psyche. I'm currently 19 and a freshman in college. This has been an underlying issue for me my whole life, but I've never really taken heed to it until I got into personal development &amp; meditation; now, i've realized, this has been destroying me life! Having this issue has been so omnipresent that I had no idea I even had it! 

&amp;#x200B;

&lt;!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

If you don't have abandonment issues, I'll briefly fill you in; if you're reading this because you too suffer from it, go ahead and skip this section. 

I've destroyed relationships, friendships, and infinitely indefinite amount of potential relationships &amp; friendships. Basically I've observed that it comes down to two separate domains, each with its own set of issues. The first domain of issues is the idea that people hate me, don't like me, and that there's no way they could actually like me. unbelievably stunning, beautiful, and intelligent women have made their way into my life and I've destroyed all those relationships because I just didn't believe they were actually into me. Out of 25 kids I was one of the only two chosen to be initiated in one my school's fraternities, but I dropped it today because I felt like there's no way these people like me &amp; they hated me. The second domain is walking on eggshells: ""now I did it."" This thought controls my mind. When ever I say anything, do anything, etc, I instantly feel like ""now I did it. That was it. Everyone hates me now. Now they're leaving you for sure."" Basically that's my life story. 

\------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------&gt;

Anyways, freshman year was an awesome experience! I've met so many people, hooked up with a lot girls, etc, etc, but it's all very shallow... I'm lucky I suppose, I don't have any social anxiety, and I'm a pretty confident guy. I'm able to meet people, laugh, vibe, and enjoy each-others presence--girls, guys, teachers, adults, bosses, etc--but when it's time to make a real connection, that's when things go really bad... I become cold, aloof, antisocial, etc. I imagen I hurt people's feelings because I'll get so bogged down by this idea that they don't actually like me, they hate me, that I'll stop waving &amp; interacting with them all together. I'm sure I leave them vexed &amp; hurt. (but I don't know if they hated me to begin with)

  
I'm self-aware enough to watch this phenomena happen before my eyes: I feel like a prisoner in my own mind. What makes me the most angry is I can't distinguish the difference between this mental fabrication from actuality. I can't tell if someone actually hates me because I did something wrong, or it's just a delusion my mind is projecting. (walking on egg shells again)

&amp;#x200B;

I wish it was just as easy as not paying attention to it, but it's imbedded deep into my psyche and I don't know how to fix this issue. I really like myself, like I'm happy playing this character in the human experience, if that makes sense. This is destroying my life. Have any of you recovered or found solutions?

717,"It’s actually crazy how much my anxiety controls me. How it can physically make my stomach churn. I think the worst part is that I struggle with hyperhidrosis which is directly related to my anxiety, aka a double hit to my mental sanity. 

It’s why I’m scared to be open with friends or family about just how bad my mental health can get. With friends, maybe I’ll share a bit here and there. Never the full extent of damage. With family? Not an option. They’re too close-minded and old-fashioned about mental health. “Just don’t think about it” is the sage wisdom they have on anxiety basically. 

These two issues (of HH and anxiety) are why I feel I’ll never be confident enough for finding a significant other. Hell, they’re why I think sometimes “50 or 60 more years and then I’ll be dead and won’t have to deal. 5-6 decades.” I wouldn’t say I’m suicidal per say, but I do have times where I just wish I wasn’t alive. I’m not particularly smart or attractive or generous. Don’t know what my long-term goals in life are. I just feel like I’m floating sometimes. 

I have siblings that are all doing great things and hitting big life milestones (having kids, looking for a house, getting into residency, getting married, securing a post-law school job) and I just feel like I’m sitting here, still the youngest in the family as usual - but now I’m 19 (going on 20) and not 8. 8 was a fine time to be shy and unsure.

718,"Hi everyone,

&amp;#x200B;

I just wanted to talk about the type of anxiety that has plagued me for a long time. It is a combination of depression and anxiety that I call anxious listlessness. I really haven't talked about it much with anyone, but want to write some of this down because writing things down helps me figure out what to do. If anyone else wants to add some specific things they experience with their anxiety, go right ahead. It's totally open.

&amp;#x200B;

Here is what my experience is like:

* I feel guilty for doing nothing, but have no energy nor desire to do anything. 
* I cycle through things to do constantly, but the heaviness in my body and mind talk me out of doing anything appealing almost immediately. 
* The thought of doing anything productive is riddled with so many what-ifs that I become afraid and never even start. 
* The thought of talking to anyone about it is terrifying. When I do, I keep my head low and mention it in passing. 
* Seeing other people being productive or having a hobby makes me feel worse. My spouse is very involved in a hobby, but I mostly jut watch and wish I could care about something that much. It makes me feel useless.
* I crave something, but don't know what it is. 
* Everything is so temporary right now and it makes it a hundred times worse. I am relocating across the country soon and have a job lined up, which put me on cloud 9 for a few days. Now, I am trying to figure out our living situation once we get there and there are so many variables and so many things dependent on other things, I cant focus on anything else but cant get anything done with the information I have. Its an obsession tied up in things over which I have no control and its like torture. The temporary feeling in everything makes me feel like I cant move forward with anything in my life until this insane puzzle is finished, and I cant even find the corner pieces. 
* I feel tired all the time, even if I haven't done much. 
* When in doubt, I just clean and cook. Or pack. I already packed so many things in the house to prepare for our move and I don't know what to do with myself now. Its just waiting. I cant start anything big and new since I'm leaving soon, but I desperately need something to keep me engaged in the meantime. I just don't know what. My home is clean, food is in the fridge, and what I can pack early has been packed. I have no energy or room for anything else and just want to fast forward. I just pace around my home, afraid to sit down in fear of being perceived as lazy, desperately looking for something small and engaging I can do. I cant find anything anymore.
* I just want it to be rainy and awful outside so I don't have to look out the window at the beautiful, sunny day and feel guilty I'm not outside doing something. Today its cold, so I have an excuse to stay inside. I miss being outside. I backpacked Yosemite a few years ago and used to camp and hike all the time. Now just riding my bike takes a conscious effort. It feels like recreational activities take up precious time I could be spending doing something more important, even if there is nothing more important to do.
* Every time I do something productive, I feel like its never enough. Last week, I cleaned up all the trash in the yard, planted grass seed, raked, and planted flower bulbs. Yesterday, I did all the laundry, meal prepped for the week, swept and mopped all the floors, and had a nice dinner with my spouse. Today, I took my dogs for a long walk, cleaned my kitchen, scrubbed the sink, and made breakfast from scratch. I still feel lazy and useless - like I haven't done enough and never will. But there's nothing else I want to do.
* I don't have any desire to spend time with friends and family anymore, even though I used to be more social. All I want to do every day is be at home. I secretly want to do nothing, by myself, all the time, but my spouse coming in and out of the door from the garage makes my heart race. I know he doesn't judge me or care what I am doing or not doing with my free time, but my mind assumes everyone else judges me as harshly as I judge myself. He can be engaged all day doing something he loves. I can barely find the energy or motivation to do anything I enjoy. I only do things I have to do and nothing I want to do. 
* I feel guilty for random things that don't make sense. Yesterday, I mulled around Target for an hour and bought a $6 shirt on clearance with my own money. I hid it when I got home, feeling like I didn't deserve it or that I was being irresponsible. I felt bad going there without any need. I just wanted to walk around as an anonymous person somewhere. When I came home, I felt like a shallow person who fills voids with things - like a $6 shirt. 
* I try to remember my therapist telling me to give myself a break, let my mind rest, accept that it is due to a chemical imbalance and that I should not be ashamed of myself, and let inspiration come to me naturally. It never does. It just gets worse. 
* I spend all day, every day breathing shallow breaths and tensing my entire body for no reason and its almost impossible to stop, even with meditation.

723,"My version of anxiety is spinning in an external circle of “holy crap my life is on fire and everything is going to explode in T-10 seconds.” I get so over stimulated and so intense that it’s just like I could flip out on anyone in an immediate radius. I’m not abusive about it or violent, it’s more of a general need to push everything around me away and get into a calm, less stimulated space ASAP kind of drive.

His anxiety is an internal spiral of the world is ending and he’s silently panicking inside.

He is extremely sensitive to my freak outs. To give one example, I was driving a few months ago and the road conditions sucked, visibility sucked, it was dark and I ran over a snow covered part of a concrete island. No damage, just a jolt and my heart beating out of my chest... he said “Whoa! What was that? Are you okay?” And my frenzy at the moment just stumped my speech centre was kaput! I couldn’t find words, my brain was just 0 to 100 and nothing logical was happening. I said something so bitchy and harsh not even thinking about the implications of it other than my need to stop anything stimulating, “PLEASE, stop talking!”  

Today I was on the phone and freaking out because something had gone through on our credit card and we did not authorize it, so I’m losing it. He’s trying to rationalize it out loud which is totally harmless but he was talking, the CS agent was talking and my brain was not doing dual processing at the moment, I raised my hand in a “Stop!” motion...

I fully admit these are not healthy responses, and I know what’s going on in my head. But, when he receives these it’s like I’m berating and chastising him... which just happens to be a major trigger. I try to be conscious... but sometimes it just slips! I’m afraid of it being really abusive to him and I 100% do not want that to be the case. Trying to explain what’s going on in my head doesn’t really forgive it, what can I do in these moments to just catch it and calm the situation instead? Does anyone else get this? What do you do?",1

727,Second day with my new meds. Shout-out to my friend who messaged me last night after seeing my first post. You da real MVP. Im feeling a little better. Just slightlyyy weird lol. I CAN DO THIS AND SO CAN YOU GUYS! Much love!,1
728,"Hello there and welcome to my first post, I tend to be somewhat verbose which is not really the best way to capture attention on a reddit post! I do hope you can indulge me. 




I'm doing great recently, I've been in therapy for a year dealing with depressive thoughts and my wife's nervous breakdown last year (she's doing great now, better than we ever could have hoped!), but my anxiety is getting out of control. I did delay dealing with my own issues during my wife's recovery but she's f-ing eel and I've found the space to come to terms with some of my problems. 



I've got back on my feet this last year, back exercising, took up writing, become a house husband when off work since my wife works longer hours,  starting to get ready to socialise again, it's been great and I'm feeling good. But let me explain what's happening with my anexity:



I live in a slightly rough area and my house is situated on a T junction on street with allot of children. The area outside my house is the hangout for quite a few of them. Two years ago they were younger and would knock on our door and run away. We became targeted by one girl in particular who would encourage the kids to mess with us. That girl is gone these days and most of the kids have grown up and only play football (though the sound of the ball also makes me anxious). The knocks on the door have declined but still happen occasionally, kids are kids so I can't really blame them but it's driving me crazy.  



At this point ANY noise on the road sets my anxiety off and can lead to my heart beating out of control, Butterflies in my stomach, sweat, dry mouth. Symptoms vary depending on if the kids are amassed or if they are just passing. But my fear of the noise is entirely dominating my life. Every waking moment I'm thinking about what could happen, I wake up and I think about it, I go to work and think about it, when I'm going to sleep etc etc etc. I even check the weather to see if it will rain so I can relax. 




The other aspect is that I play games to relax, to escape the world, and my tower is in the living room next to the window facing on to the street. So if I'm gaming for an hour or two the kids can see that I'm there. It has occurred to me to move my rig to the back of the house to get away from my trigger but I feel the root of the issue might be worth exploring. 



I think I'll stop here and answer any questions that may arise. Without a doubt I'm suffering and it's getting out of control, and I'll be talking to my therapist about this but any and all advice is welcome. Finally if I have left out any pertinent information please let me know. Thank you for your time. ",1
729,"i was put on 37.5mg last year for social anxiety but a month and a half ago my doctor diagnosed me with depression and raised it to 75mg. i am feeling fine with it except for my issues with sleeping and some reduced libido. whenever i take the pill usually an hour or so after i've taken it i feel very lightheaded, my head hurts, i'm tired, i feel slight nausea, and possibly some slight vertigo. until recently, i kept forgetting to take it on time and have been taking it late (only for 3 days) but i'm not sure if it is the medication itself or the dosage? or the fact that i've been taking it an hour later? also, i feel kind of disconnected from my feelings after my dose was raised; i feel as though if i think of something that makes me sad i can't really fully feel it and kind of work my way through it. it's like i have a big block in my brain and it literally prevents me from feeling much or even crying when i want to cry. 

just wanted to hear some general experiences and if i should be concerned about any of this?",1
730,"please tell me i’m not alone. i have the worst bouts of anxiety. along with having ocd and dealing with those symptoms, i also have generalized anxiety and often for extremely anxious for seemingly no reason. sometimes it’ll start when i wake up, other times the middle of the day, but every time it happens it’s not triggered by anything (but it’s made worse by thinking of eating/food/being sick), i get shaky, nauseous, irritable. i feel so physically horrible that i’m almost always stuck in bed. i’ve dropped out of school because of this (and other health reasons.) 
i have emetophobia- so on one hand i understand why i get anxious. especially if i’ve been sick recently, but i don’t understand how to make it go away. it’s been 2 months since the original trigger (me being sick) happened, and i’m still having anxiety randomly and about eating, and i don’t know what to do.
i’m on 150mg of zoloft, gabapentin 3 times a day, and hydroxyzine or ativan as needed depending on the severity, and promethazine for nausea as needed. if you experience this kind of anxiety please let me know. i feel so alone.

731,"Hi,

&amp;#x200B;

I am not really sure where to post this but I'm not sure how I am supposed to move along, if I can.

Approximately a year ago I did a jaw surgery that was not necessary, yes, you heard it right.

&amp;#x200B;

It all started a few years earlier when I was taken off my braces and the process started of wearing a plastic attachment for my teeth for a few months ahead. I was sloppy with it and the result ended in a gap between my teeth, quite a big one.

&amp;#x200B;

Jumping forward approximately two years ago I once again started to wear braces and the process of fixing the gap started. For some reason I did not want to tell the dentist that it was most likely due to me being sloppy with the plastic attachment, I am not sure if I felt ashamed or similar. The issue with me is that I have a really hard time to be honest about my feelings and this is not the first time I have been in situations where I have just accepted it, for example being bullied, being quite lonely, left jobs due to social phobia. It feels like eventually I am gonna realize all the stuff I never dared to tell people and feel loads of anxiety.

&amp;#x200B;

As I sit here and write I feel nauseous and that I have let down family. That I do not have the courage to tell people how I feel or when I feel bad keeps getting me into situations I do not want. Luckily enough, the surgery was quite minimal and I look pretty much the same. But it is not about that, it is about taking an issue that I do not dare to tell family or others and elevate it to something like this.

&amp;#x200B;

I have no clue how to move forward from this, almost every evening I think about it and it makes me feel so so bad about myself.",1
732,"I am 26 years old and I’ve lived my entire life with anxiety. As far back as I can remember (5 years old) I would throw tantrums because I didn’t want to go to school or after school activities. I used to cry a lot as a baby up until about 11. I remember having the worst nausea and stomach aches because of my anxiety. My parents were very hands-off in raising me and they were not (and are still not) available emotionally throughout my life. This definitely has made my anxiety worse.

When I turned 18 I decided to get treatment, but because I have Kaiser (a subpar medical insurance imo), it was hard to get a therapist who didn’t have appointments that were 1-2 months apart. I felt it wasn’t safe for me to be taking medication if I wasn’t able to see my therapist on a consistent basis. I have been on Zoloft, Prozac, etc. and it has not helped. I’ve also been prescribed Klonopin which is the only thing that did help but we all know it isn’t safe for long term use. I currently just started seeing a therapist but I don’t know if we mesh well. She diagnosed me with panic disorder but I don’t really know if what I have is that.  

I hate my job. I am in retail in service experience and have to deal with people for 8-9 hours a day. I don’t know what to do with my life. I didn’t go to college, and even if I wanted to at this point I need to work full time just to afford my life. School gives me anxiety. I want to eventually do things I enjoy to create a career for myself but I don’t even know how to do that with my anxiousness. 

My anxiousness comes in the mornings, when I’m driving, and with difficult customers. I mostly just get sweaty and my heart races. The physical symptoms really outweigh everything else. Even when I don’t feel anxious I get sweaty and it triggers my anxiety... does this make sense? If I could control these physical symptoms like my racing heart and sweat I wouldn’t become (more) anxious. 

What can I do to resolve this? ",1

I literally can’t even walk out the house and see someone with out panicking ,1
734,"I do admit that I am not exactly the most adept when it comes to social skills. I know that I have social anxiety and I have had it for years.

&amp;#x200B;

Sometimes I behave in ways that one would describe as odd or unorthodox - I can sometimes be very blunt and direct and honest, I can sometimes be very quiet and reserved, and sometimes I can just make the big leap and introduce myself or simply just jump into someone else's bubble or discussions without going into the formalities first because it is an anxious and awkward thing to do.

&amp;#x200B;

Then again, I still remind myself that there is no clear why of describing ""good"" social skills because everyone behaves differently and everyone has their own way of expressing themselves.

&amp;#x200B;

But that being said, the thing that irritates and scares me the most is when I am pushed away or given the silent treatment or not communicated with for a while or worst, being ghosted.

&amp;#x200B;

I know that you will not connect with everyone and I know that different people have different preferences and will react differently on how you act and have their own priorities on whether they should give that person a chance or just behave on their own instincts or unconscious biases and just avoid that person because he/she is too odd or that there is something off about them

&amp;#x200B;

But I realised that this happens all the time irregardless of how I approach myself or irregardless of how geniune I try to be or honest or whether I make an effort to fake it until I make it.

&amp;#x200B;

And this not only pisses me off because I hate it when people just do not have the balls to say it out front that they do not want to talk to you or just did not connect with you (I know that not everyone has the courage but I still find it as a shitty excuse to leave someone in the dark), but makes me so damn self-conscious about myself and how people see me and especially how I see myself.

&amp;#x200B;

Social anxiety often keeps on the edge over every tiny little detail that pops up in your head, whether the worry is geniune or just an over-exaggarated delusion or a simple problem that you go into it too deeply. And every time this happens, I go into worry overboard and makes me wonder whether I really am as much of a weirdo or whether the approach would have been better if I did a bit differently or whatever ""what-if"" scenario you can think of that puts you in a state of rumination for hours even though it does not get you anyway.

&amp;#x200B;

It becomes very personal and filled with angst and worry and sheer depression and sorrow which puts me in a constant loop of continous increase in my social anxiety, refusal to interact with others, sheer over-thinking and over-analysing every tiny little detail to the point of a sheer burnout, and wondering why I have not been able to contact with anyone which fills me with shame, regret and embarassement.

&amp;#x200B;

It is annoying, frustrating and just damnright tormenting. I know that this is all done by myself and the only perpetrator here is me, myself and I alone. But it is really damn hard to convince yourself to get a grip about this especially when this involves on how you think about yourself right in your very core of your soul and how you somehow paradoxically are used to being alone or used to this storm of emotions and anxiety and torment (and I mean this in a somewhat healthy way, not in a learned helplessness kind of way) even though there are those moments where feeling lonely and anxious just feel like you are carrying so much weight. I know that to some extent, this is all in my head even though it actually pretty real and feels very geniune and intense but damn it it hurts",1
735,"I feel honestly well rested, it's just I feel a bit drowsy still despite sleeping for 9 hours. Took 50 mgs before bed, but laid in bed for about an hour until I passed out.

Tomorrow I have class, so hopefully it still works. I get really nervous about going to class, and I'm in the process of getting a new therapist, so I'm hopefully in the clear once I start going to class.",1
736,"I tried taking SSRIs years ago and hated them. It felt like all they did was make me into a half zombie and destroy my ability to orgasm. I was really loathe to try meds again for a long time but after self medicating with weed and alcohol and trying CBD oil and struggling with insomnia for so long, I decided to try again.

I described my hatred of SSRIs to my PA and she prescribed buspirone. I was skeptical of it because of posts online where people said it did nothing, or that it only worked for people in Seattle where it was discovered, but after taking it for a few months I'm pretty sure it does help.

I still have some anxiety but it just feels like it's down a notch or two. My IBS has been in control, I haven't felt that absolute, floor-falling-out-from-me panic I used to feel on the regular in a very long time, and I haven't really felt the need for the self medicating either.

I guess I just wanted to share this somewhere. I guess it is true that you should just try different meds until you find one that works. Hopefully this keeps up. Not having that super powerful anxiety all the time has only made me more aware of how much I hated it.",1

738,"Hi all,

&amp;#x200B;

I get stress and anxiety, mostly around relationship issues (being single/lonely or failed relationships).  I am currently in an acute period of stress/anxiety that I am trying to fix (most notably - insomnia \[sleep maintenance - can't stay asleep\])

&amp;#x200B;

I should be documenting all this because I can't tell causes/effects.  

&amp;#x200B;

I developed new anxiety symptoms:

&amp;#x200B;

* face feeling pressure (as if someone is cutting off circulation and blood is pooling in my face longside pressure)
* becoming pretty vascular relative to normal times
* stomach burning sensation like i swallowed really hot sauce with sandpaper (this is new too)

&amp;#x200B;

What's going on:

1. Acute stress/anxiety from a failed relationship
2. Taking many herbs/vitamins (consistent with Vitamin C since i'm so beat up from exercise and emotional stress - curious if this could cause burning sensation and anxiety)
3. Sometimes it's burning sensation in my stomach and regurgitating food (could have a burning taste or just the actual food - GERD or Rumination? neither?) I use marijuana 1x a week and that could contribute to a weak esophagus but not sure it's the culprit

Any similar experiences/solutions/thoughts?

743,"I feel like I have a very strange case of anxiety/GAD/depression that has stumped my GP's for years...  


I used to smoke a lot of weed. After a few years of it i noticed: lump in my mouth making it difficult to swallow, clicks in my throat, brain fog, lots of hair loss and alopecia when I was sleep deprived (long flights/exam season). My hair was super thick and it has started to become dry and crispy, shedding a lot whenever I smoked. The damage always happened during my sleep, or lack of quality sleep as i'd always wake up prematurely with intense restless legs and scattered mind.  Whenever I stopped smoking weed, I would sleep \*fine\* and would even sleep extra long and thoroughly, like my body was making up for lost sleep. When this happened my hair loss immediately stopped. I realised I had GAD/mild depression even though I had NOTHING to be anxious or depressed about. I started taking a citalopram SSRI and after two weeks I was fine, hair was silky smooth, not falling out, could sleep properly. So i stupidly started smoking again and a month later the symptoms returned. 

&amp;#x200B;

 I've tried going back on SSRI's and even upping the dose, but it doesn't seem to have the same healing effect. Has my body gotten used to them? I loved smoking weed so much I thought it was worth the damage, especially since I knew how to make it stop... or so I thought.  


Cut to a few years later and my has receded and thinned so much that 3 weeks ago I have given up smoking, drinking, caffeine altogether. The problem is in those 3 weeks i still have anxiety ridden sleep, restless legs and reduced hair loss, but still shedding. 

&amp;#x200B;

I've read that it takes 3 months to trigger hair loss from a cause, but i'm 100% sure that the days I drink and smoke, I wake up with tonnes of hair on my pillow, and striking restless sensation on my legs.

And when I say worry I mean going over things in my head every waking moment, battling my own head, it is truly exhausting, I’m in CBT but I’m on a break as my therapist has had to take time off. I can feel it slowly wearing me down.

And now the main question, I know I love my gf and she’s super attractive but this constant questioning own mind and fighting myself has destroyed my self confidence. Outwardly I’m a very confident person, I’m one of those people you’d never expect to be suffering, a gym goer, social, makes everyone laugh and always smiling. But it’s getting harder to hide as I’m no longer always smiling so my gf notices more and more. Anyway, how do I build my self confidence? This constant battling has me feeling worthless, the constant fighting my own head about my relationship makes me feel like I’m not a good bf. A bit graphic I know but I’ve always had regular sex, either daily or once every two days, but now I’ve lost all interest in sex, porn or sexual stimulation in general. Mayybe not lost interest, I really want to have sex but I can’t, I worry I won’t keep an erection and constantly check during sex, which I know is wrong, but now I just don’t feel confident or worthy enough to start anything, I don’t feel like a man,  which only serves to worry me more. How do I build myself back up? I feel if I don’t have sex then it’ll ruin the relationship but then that’s putting too much pressure on myself, along with the other OCD reasons that take me out of the moment which makes sex more of a test for myself rather than something to enjoy. Also I have spoken to my gf about it in a limited capacity but it’s a newish relationship, I’m her first bf and her understanding of mental health isn’t the best, she sometimes doesn’t understand that these thoughts are irrational, plus I don’t want her to take all my baggage (I know people will say find someone who you can tell everything to, but that’ll come with time.

The worst thing is, I know my worth, I’m a 6’4, muscly, charming guy who’s been told by my superiors I have a bright future and I’m a good example, everyone tells me how I funny I am. Now I’m not vain I have flaws like everyone else, but to constantly have to think about myself as a disgusting disappointment or battle myself having to convince my subconscious I’m not something I know I’m not is exhausting and it truly does drain life of its pleasure. The only time I can relax is when I have something rational to worry about e.g. money etc.",1
750,"I’m sooo exhausted(F21). I’m always on edge for no reason. And my poor boyfriend really cops it all. 
I get angry if he’s late to coming to chill? Like it’s only 20 mins or so but it really bothers me. I have like time management issues. Like for me it’s okay to be late to things but if someone’s late to hang out with me I get so frustrated???? Like I’m so anxious when I really shouldn’t be. I love him but fuck does he annoy me so much. He’s kinda disorganised and lazy at times and doesn’t see that sometimes I need someone to help me calm down and just create an environment that will settle me. When I’m on edge and I need something and I don’t get it I’m soooo angry and just become so stand offish. And half the time I don’t even know what I want???? 

Sometimes I think it’s bc of my whole life drama with my parents. My dad was super flaky on the family I legit saw him like only a little, and when he was home mum and him would just fight. 

Ever since my dad left (10 years ago) my mum went through a lot. (She had a rough childhood bc she was the only girl in the house and her dad was a shitty man and her mum was a proper European wife who stood by her husband). She’s depressed but she does her best.  I try to keep her happy and do as much as possible for her so she’s in a good mood it’s really worth it bc she’s really crazy when she’s upset or angry.

Sounds so dumb but like if my mum is on edge so am I. If she’s upset I’m on edge. If she’s all good then I’m all good. My sister (18) is kinda a bit of a troubled kid. She doesn’t care about much but her nails friends and makeup. She’s got no aspirations and just is so angry at the world. So when she’s in a mood I’m on edge. If my cat jumps the fence for a long period of time I get on edge. If I don’t complete my bedtime routine I get a shitty sleep and I’m on edge the next day. If I don’t have my eye mask or earplugs in a dark room with no sound I don’t sleep well and I’m on edge. 

I need to be in control of everything. This is my only coping mechanism that works for me. But I want it to change bc I can feel my boyfriend is finding me sometimes to be a bit of a princess. But I also love being a princess. I want to talk to him about this but i feel like I’ll probs have a mental break down in front of him and he won’t be able to handle that. He’s got enough of his own problems as it is. 

I’m so sorry if this doesn’t make sense to you I’m having a really hard time explaining how I feel atm. I’m not sure what I’m feeling and I can’t sleep right now because I’m not in control of my emotions. It’s stressing me out.

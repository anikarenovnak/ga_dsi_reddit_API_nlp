0,"Welcome to /r/depression's check-in post - a place to take a moment and share what is going on and how you are doing. If you have an accomplishment you want to talk about (these shouldn't be standalone posts in the sub as they violate the ""role model"" rule, but are welcome here), or are having a tough time but prefer not to make your own post, this is a place you can share.

We try our best to keep this space as safe and supportive as possible on reddit's wide-open anonymity-friendly platform. The community rules can be found in the sidebar, or under ""Community Info"" in the official mobile apps. If you aren't sure about a rule, [please ask us](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Fdepression). 

*****

Sorry about letting the last post get archived.  We've been super-busy keeping up with the modqueue and that's slowing down our work on making the community rules more clear and visible and migrated to the standard reddit rules system - we *are* spending all the available time we have on that.  In the meantime, if you're on mobile, please read the info and rules which are under ""Community Info"" on the menu when you're visiting the subreddit.  

I'd like to highlight the most common violations that create extra work for us.  Please use reddit's ""report"" function when you see anything like that.  The exact reasons are less important than the existence of a report, because that puts it in our modqueue where we will look at it first chance we get.  

*  Helpers inviting private contact as a first resort.  Nobody who's both well-meaning and knowledgeable should ever do this.  Please keep your conversations out in the public threads unless/until you've established a solid rapport, and preferably let the OP decide when it's time to go private.   

* ""I'm here to help"" posts.  These are specifically against the rules.  

* Posts that aren't directly relevant to personal experience of depression, the mental illness and/or aren't requests for support.  Everything we do here is based on our core belief that talking about depression is both important and difficult, so we need to be strict about keeping on-topic.  You don't need to have a clinical diagnosis of depression to post here, but, on the other hand, being diagnosed doesn't mean it's okay for you to talk about anything.  For example, depression is *not* loneliness, it's not low self-esteem, and it's not being sad or distressed for good reasons.  Those are all important and serious issues too, and they should be discussed, but this is not the place.  

**Edit:**  I wrote this in a comment reply below but I want to highlight it here:  We enforce the rules as leniently as possible in the case of people who have come here to get support, but strictly in the case of people who are here for any other reason. We think it makes sense to ask people who are giving help to police themselves, but we try to cut people in need of help as much slack as we can without allowing discussions that take focus away from others in need of support. 

If you have concerns or questions about community business or moderation, please talk to us [in modmail](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Fdepression) before you make a post about it.  

Thanks to everyone for their courage in sharing their struggles, and their kindness in supporting others.  ",0

4,"I wonder how many of us can relate to [this article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Learned_helplessness).

&gt;&gt;Learned helplessness is behavior that occurs when the subject endures repeatedly painful or otherwise aversive stimuli which it is unable to escape from or avoid. After such experiences, the organism often fails to learn or accept ""escape"" or ""avoidance"" in new situations where such behavior is likely to be effective. In other words, the organism learned that it is helpless. In situations where there is a presence of aversive stimuli, it has accepted that it has lost control and thus gives up trying, even as changing circumstances offer a method of relief from said stimuli. Such an organism is said to have acquired learned helplessness. Learned helplessness theory is the view that clinical depression and related mental illnesses may result from such real or perceived absence of control over the outcome of a situation.",0

I wake up, make food, and sit down at my computer. I immediately open reddit, and my browser quickly fills up with tabs. It doesn't take look to seemingly run out of new content, so I usually hop on Rocket League for a little while. I tell myself I'm going to do some training so that I can actually improve, but instead I usually play casual games for an hour or until I become mentally fatigued. Back to reddit. Every once in a while I contemplate doing something productive: learn a new language, practice drawing, maybe even write even though I can barely form a coherent sentence. Instead I browse reddit, watch youtube videos/twitch streams, and play storyless video games to pass the time. When I'm finally tired I sit on my bed and watch a comfort show (usually something like Friends or Frasier) until I can barely keep my eyes open. I do this to avoid the chance of the wrong kind of anxiety showing up as I'm trying to fall asleep, which can lead to a temporary state of depersonalization hell.

Please please please believe that this pain is TEMPORARY. i promise you that time heals all. Every second, minute, day that you hang in there is a huge obstacle in and of itself that you have single-handedly overcome. Take it from someone who has been there and still am. All you have to do is make it another 10 seconds. Then that’ll turn into a minute and then an hour and so on. So when you have a bad moment, just keep counting to 10 over and over again.

10,"I've had depression since I was 15, now 22. When I was 16, my parents bought me a bearded dragon to try and help me when I was feeling bad. 

Whenever I felt bad I took him out and just felt him run around my shoulders and listened to music. As he grew, he helped to distract me from feeling suicidal with his care needs and just being cute. He was never aggressive, never moody and would love to sit on top of my head in my hair. I eventually went to university 3 years later and took him with me. By this point he was a massive beautiful golden scaled adult and loved greens and insects, and same as always whenever I felt bad or suicidal he would be there for me.

Two weeks ago he was diagnosed with terminal liver cancer. He has deteriorated terribly to the point where I am taking him back to the vets next week to be put to sleep, and I'm trying my best to support him as well as he supported me. I'm going to miss him a lot.

Pets are so loyal and kind, they dont care if you've had a bad day, they don't care if you're struggling, they're just there for you. Take care of your pets guys, they are beautiful and we are so lucky to have beings that will always be there to support us and just enjoy our company.

Dont tell me to find something I love and turn it into profit.  Even things I love I dont want to do every day for hours. Also not every person passions are very profitable. 
I hate human interaction,  fake politeness and submissing myself in any form.  I just cant do it,  its stronger than me idk maybe its some mental disorder?

Why does depression always make me feel really stupid? Basic functions have become really difficult. For example I can’t put words into a coherent sentence when talking to someone. The words in my head make sense, but as soon as they leave my mouth they make zero sense to anyone. It’s as if I’m speaking in another language.

I have a ton of great memories from back when I was less than 10, and I remember everything in great detail. I have slightly less in terms of great memories from my early teens, but they’re still there. Good memories from my late teens and early twenties are practically non-existent; I loath who I was at that time, I wish I had spent more time with my family and loved ones. I feel like I just woke up to find that everything I ever loved is now gone, and all I feel is sorrow and a sickening, gut wrenching, heartbreak at what I lost, at what I will never have again.

I don't know what to do anymore, everything and everyone is overwhelming. I can't even imagine any kind of future for me, I feel like I should just die. I'm not even feeling suicidal (I think) but it just sounds like dying is the logical answer to all this.

I'm tired of trying, time and time again. There are things that I enjoy and people that I like but I feel so broken inside that it seems like all of this is meaningless. I don't know where to go, therapy isn't helping at all, I wish I could just disappear, stop existing. ",0

""... the threat of suicide [for me] isn't like being carried over a waterfall — it is like living in the ocean...alone, with an expanse of water at all sides. Some days are unremarkable, floating under clear skies and smooth waters; other days are tumultuous storms you don’t know you’ll survive, but you’re always, always in the ocean. And when you live in the ocean, treading to stay afloat, you eventually get the feeling that one day, inevitably, there will be nowhere for you to go but down.""

But nowadays things are a lot more complicated. I don't have friends anymore (they are all too busy with their own lives and never want to talk or hang out), but I do have a job that I like and getting great grades in college, all while managing my depression. My life is alright, but I wouldn't say I'm happy. I'm really lonely, and kind of messed up from some of my relationships.

I am of the belief that you need to put in the work to be happy, but I really struggle sometimes with believing that things will get better. I would like to hear some of your success stories with making a better life for yourself and dealing with mental illness.

30,"Hi there, new to this sub.

I've been dealing with something these past few days and maybe someone here has had it or something similar and can offer advice on how to overcome it. I'm hoping it's just a result of overthinking, paranoia and that its truly all in my head and it will pass soon.

It's very hard to explain as its happening in my own mind so nobody would know exactly what's going on but I'm gonna do the best I can. Maybe some of you have advice.

Basically during the day I sometimes get this thought that tells me I'm gonna stop feeling excited and joyful about things. It could be at a low moment or a moment when I'm actually in fact happy but its just a thought ""you cant be happy"" and it makes me unhappy instantly and I get fearful that it's true and I'm gonna stop feeling joy and excitement soon. So weird. 

 Now, I've tried a few different techniques that have worked temporarily like telling the thought it has no power over my mind and that I just have to believe I have dominance over my mind and I can be happy, or that the thought isn't true and these often work for about 5 minutes to 30 minutes but then I get the thought again and it takes control. Essentially I'm able to convince myself the thought isnt real and I genuinely believe it to be false and so I feel happy and powerful, but then the thought comes back later only to scare me and make me doubt its false. I try to distract myself by thinking of other things about my life but the thought always comes up and sometimes even stays and I cant distract myself from it even when thinking other things. I've tried ignoring it altogether when it comes up but that usually just feels worse because then it starts actually working and controlling my mind. Lately, the thought has been coming back again and again nonstop. 

When I keep trying to think positive, smile or drown it out with different thoughts, it gets exhausting and I start to feel trapped in my mind, like everything around me is harder to process. Its almost a cloudy feeling like I'm out of touch with everything outside my own mind.

Music, Youtube videos, Netflix, reading and meditation helps me a lot with this during my down time and it only really happens during the day. In the morning and at night I'm pretty good.

 But I cant have this all the time during the day when I'm out and about. When I'm walking from place to place and stuck with nothing but my own thoughts is when it's the worst. Also I dont want to just distract myself, I'd rather conquer this altogether rather than keep suppressing it

Advice on how to deal with this? It's only been going on for a few days and I definitely wanna confront it right now before it gets any worse. I'm also open to doing therapy if its needed. I hope it's all in my head and I dont have any early sign of anything big but even if I do I'd much rather know now.

31,"We are broken people. Life has been unfair to us. Destiny has been playing cruel games with us.  We’ve been exposed to sadness and tears for so long, when we find true happiness we can’t hold on to it. We throw good things away and go back to being miserable because that’s what we’re familiar with. We’re broken. We’re broken beyond repair. We’re beyond help. And yet, here we are!

32,"This is a question that has been popping up in my head in the past few days.

I don't know what to think anymore. My life has been so shit compared to others for most of the time. But then things happen, that make me question whether there may be a bigger plan.I dropped out of school one year before getting my degree because I had the opportunity to start training for my dream job. I quit school and was all in all super excited to start my dream.Until I got a call one day before I was supposed to start. They told me some medical stuff didn't pass and that I could never work in this field.I was crushed. I have never ever felt so bad. I couldn't get out of bed for 3 weeks.My depression came back. I had been fighting it before and the prospect of starting my dream job really helped me. But that was all gone at once.I fought through, worked in retail for a year to pass the time and to search for something else I would do with my life.And then I found it: The same job I had applied to before. With better more opportunities to advance later. It was cross country, over 800km away. That only pushed me more. I could leave my old life behind, stop being depressed, make friends and be the person I always wanted to be.I applied and after just 4 weeks I got the approval to start.I had to move into one of the most expensive cities in my country, but I somehow got an affordable place.It all just fell into my lap. I couldn't believe I had actually done it. There had to be something/someone else who had helped me.

I was so ready to become my new me. It worked for just a few weeks. I was still the weird, socially awkward guy I was before. My old routine came back. When I was not at work I was on my Computer playing games and watching videos.The prospect of finally having friends and/or a girlfriend fainted so fast.Now with the added bonus of sudden panic attacks, when training got too hard. I now always have the fear: When I fail here I will have nothing. And no way in the world would the same thing as before happen again.

It has been eight months.Work is still fun, but I am still alone. This depresses me once again.I wish I could just meet someone, who actually likes me, but I can't.At work, I can push these feelings behind, because I actually have fun, but once I get home I am lost.

I don't know how this happened. Was it really just look that brought me here? Is there a bigger plan that still has to unfold, which will make me happy? If so: when will it happen? And why is it taking so long?  

Or am I going to be alone forever waiting for someone else to fix my problems?",0
33,"A month ago, I posted about having an exam in a few hours and unprepared. Today got the result and I failed it. Moreover, everyone in my class knows about the score and I am extremely embarrassed. The main thing is I have another exam tomorrow and now I have zero motivation to prepare. I think I am pretty sure that I will fail that too.

Things have changed so much with depression. A semester ago, I was doing extremely well in my advanced level classes and now I am failing everywhere. I just feel sad and empty. I am not even afraid of ruining my studies.

I am an expat. There is no one else around. I have a child. I cannot simply run home. I have to be strong. Besides, I have no where to run to. I have the memories that once were but that is all they are. Memories and nothing more. I am so tired of myself yet no one knows. I am the perfect employee. I am the personification of perfection then I return home. I exist, I do not live. Dying is not an option. I recognize my symptoms but I cannot express them.  I have been alone for so long, I simply cannot connect. I do not know how to get help. Being in a foreign country is not helping.  I have never tried a platform like reddit before but I simply cannot do it any longer. I need positive reaffirmation. I need help. I feel pathetic. I know it is a sickness but I seem to be losing the battle today. I cannot think rationally. I could write more but it would not helpful; it would be nothing more then self-pitying attempt at self-flagellation/punishment and nothing more. Not worth the words.

38,"I (17M) really feel bad posting on here since I haven't helped anyone else out. I just feel so empty inside. 

I used to be a great guy who was a track captain, marching band leader, student council, 4.0 GPA and all that. I was the golden child. But on top of that, I wanted to help out other people who are less fortunate. I used to go every week to the food pantry to volunteer, I used to stay up nights with people going through what I'm going through right now, and every summer I used to go abroad to a third world nation and volunteer in medical brigades because I used to want to work with Doctors without Borders as a career. All of this is because I believed no one deserved to suffer, but I feel like I'm one of the few people in the world who believe that and that everyone wants to see ME suffer. 

That really all changed when depression hit. One girl did something that drove my best friend and me apart and then that best friend went on to alienate me from everyone. That's where it all started, from there it was just a rabbit hole of getting sadder until I wasn't able to be happy at all even when things were going right. I was hospitalized twice from suicide attempts, I seek therapy but it's not helping, yall know how it is. 

Through many of the initial stages, I had my schools' marching band to be a support group for me. I had been kicked out of a lot of the things I was in but the marching band and the summer brigades I went on felt like the only places where I really belonged. We had a groupchat we called the ""support squad"", the marching band lost some of our members to suicide and we had all agreed to help each other out, and I used to help out others on that chat but I never really sought help from them because I didn't want to be a burden, the same way I feel right now. But one day my band friends, who I trusted more than anyone, went to my band director and spread a bunch of lies and got me kicked out. The Band director believed me, but he still kicked me out cuz I was ""too negative"".

That was really it for me, even when I was positive after getting mostly cured of depression with my hospital stays, he still wouldn't take me back. No one wants me back. What's the point of even trying if I'm the only one I know who wants to get better. I feel like its a cycle of I get depressed, people make it worse, I attempt suicide, those same people cry for me and say things like ""I'm always here for you"", I get better and more positive, and then everyone shuts me out again, making me depressed, and so on. I can't go back to the hospital, I don't know what to do anymore. My parents are going to take me out of the summer brigades cuz of my dipped grades due to my lack of motivation and then I will really be good for nothing. 

I'm sorry for ranting, its been on my chest and I have no one to go to which is why I'm glad I discovered this. All I wanted to do was be a normal kid and help the world out. I wanted to go to parties and have fun with friends and do things like prom and mall runs but that was all robbed from me, I had to dip my own birthday party yesterday and go cry in my car because my friends will do anything to hurt me.  I wanted to be a guiding light for everyone, even more so now that I know what its like to suffer, but I'm just not the help and the great person I used to be and sometimes I feel like the best way to help everyone out is to just go away. There's just no purpose left for me besides existing, while all the people I helped are going on and achieving great things while shutting me out, I'm just there being a good for nothing useless piece of shit. 

If anyone does need hmu ill give you my contact and I can try to help you, I'm just not as good at helping people as I used to be.

But for me and a lot of people, it keeps coming back. It’s so demotivating. I wish it would just be gone forever. At least I recognized the symptoms right away this time and kind of know what to expect...that it will take me another 2 years to fully recover. I noticed straight away that I stopped talking to everyone. I don’t want to. I don’t want to leave the house. I love staying at home. It’s the safest place on earth. I don’t enjoy doing anything anymore. One thing that changed is that last time I was severely depressed I always had a little bit of hope things will be good one day.

There is SO much bad (death in the family, or anything bad that can happen, which is actually a lot) in the world and so little good (happiness never lasts and sadness and depression can last forever). I can’t even think of anything that makes me truly happy. Everything that makes one happy (a good job, an SO) can turn on you at any second. ",0

Even now I'm subconsouisly coming up with reasoning to not do it, reasons like lust and coming out of my shell, even the smallest things like wearing nice clothes and seeing the new avengers movie. I just can't do it anymore. One second everything is enough and I'm fine and the next everything goes dark and I'm positive on what I'll do tomorrow. 

I've thought about calling the sucide prevention hotline but I got my phone taken away and there chatroom always has like 40 people ahead of you. At the end of the day this is the only way I can go, I've never even thought about getting to 30 alive and intact. 

Though I do remember a poem my ex girlfriend showed me, of course i don't remember it now it was months ago, but it had something to do with a hole in the sidewalk, a hole i always thought I'd fall into, but one day I climb out, then the next I go to the other sidewalk.

46,"I've been unwell for a long time.

Today, my naive mother got us into a scam. These people knocked on our door to sell us water filters. They're a sweet talking couple of fellas. So, my old mother immediately believed them, and got comfortable to talk about private stuff, because she always does that.

She told them about  tragedies from our past, and that really fucking hurt me. I was dumbfounded that she trusted two complete strangers so quickly, and crushed about how she brought up such a sensitive event to me. She told them about other things.

Me being the skeptic that I'm, I didn't buy their shit for a fucking second. But she went to grab the money anyways, and I followed after her to try and convince her of the bullshit. Surprise fucking surprise, she believed them and not me. She gave the money and got that thing installed.

I called my sister right after because her husband know about these things. I yelled at my mom a bit about her foolish actions, but not very harshly. I went to the shower and cried at how she didn't believe me and trusted complete strangers. After I got out of the shower, I brushed my hair, and listened to music. Then my sister came with her husband and kids. I told husband I'll explain, he said alright.

He waited outside, and I sure did explain. But something odd happened. I showed emotion. For the first time since I was a kid, I cried in front of somebody. It was right when I told him about the tragedy that she told them. Kinda regret crying, but whatever.

You might ask, well you told us, why blame your mother?

To that I'd reply, you'll never know who I'm. And if we met irl, I certainly wouldn't tell you any of this shit.

So where's the light?

Well, I succeeded in showing emotion, even if it is to a man that I do not particularly have a bond with.

I may be able to survive depression, but I don't know if I'll ever forgive mom.

47,"I'm a 20 year old female with a long distance boyfriend. I'm doing a computer science major while he's taking a year off to do civil service (it's required to be done in his country).

​

After this year of civil service he's going to go to university too, but he's arguably going to a more prestigious university than I am where he'll probably be set up to earn a lot of money later. Not that computer science isn't prestigious but it just somehow feels like it's lamer than the university he's going for. Furthermore the field he's going into is design in which there are a lot of girls.. So he'll be surrounded by girls.

​

The thing is I'm really insecure and I don't like how I look, I'm way below average compared to other girls my age. You can't disagree with it, it's just objectively so and I notice it every day from how people treat me compared to prettier girls. He says he loves me and that he doesn't want anybody but me, and that he doesn't even care how other girls look or that nobody can be more important to him than I am, but I just can't get myself to believe it in my heart. Men often go for pretty girls despite everything they say. Men just want a girlfriend who looks good. I'm quite ugly in my opinion and I can't do anything about it. I feel disadvantaged at school because of it and I will be disadvantaged a little bit in the work life too. Furthermore no guy has ever flirted with me.

​

My boyfriend is just a normal guy, he doesn't really get girls flirting with him because he's introverted like me but he doesn't have some things like a mental illness or depression which I do have. I'm just so scared that when he goes to university and settles into the next stage of his life, I'll be out of it at one point. He says he doesn't care about other girls but if he's surrounded by lovely nice pretty girls with prestigious lives while I'll always be ugly and not as good as them it just feels like he'll keep growing and growing and that I'll be walking behind him and won't be able to keep up with him. I'm so terrified because I can't live without him, the only reason my days aren't completely terrible for me are because of him and I'm so scared that everything he's said to me will be something he'll turn his back on. Nobody has ever kept their word to me with it despite what they say and despite that he seems different I'm so scared. I don't know what to do and it kills me.",0

She shouldn't have to take care of the disappointment that I am. I can't even socially interact which will cause me to not look for a job/university because I'm just too scared to talk to people.

No, nothing special happened, I was out with my “friends”, nice weather, everyone drinking, having fun and complaining about my antisocial behavior. I just couldn’t feel my normal interest on alcohol and people as I usually do. I wasn’t even in the mood for food, which is what always brings my mood up

I just got home, and I already feel all the weight and unmotivation coming up for the next days, weeks, or who knows months. The worst part is: I don’t know where does it come from. and it sucks all my positivity away, I hate doing everything that kept me going..I was having a fine time for the last few weeks, I even noticed how much good I was feeling. But I’m back to the tunnel and I can’t see any light at the end once again.. 

All I can really do is think it must go away at some point. I wonder if my life will always be like this. It goes and it comes. when I don’t really know what “it” is or how to describe it. Does it ever stop? I’m so young and if I’ll be miserable like this maybe I should just end it all. I still have hopes, for now

I've been generally slowly getting better for the last four months, but I've started to recognize a pattern in my relapses. If I go without seeing a friend or loved one during the day, around the late afternoon my anxiety and depression will hit like a fucking truck, along side occasional suicidal thoughts. I live on a very small college campus where everyone knows everyone and I have a couple of friends, but not a real group of friends that hangs out regularly. This makes it hard for me to get that daily social interaction that keeps me from falling back into my depression. I have tried joining a student organization but we don't meet up that often and I also don't have a lot of time due to my honors program being extremely demanding. I have a long distance boyfriend that is very supportive, but only in person social interactions help me feel better.

This is my second post here and I have a question, if you were to have a suicidal friend and you found this note in your locker at school or something;

&amp;#x200B;

'if I don’t think I’m worth it,

Then who will.

Lost in my own mind,

Not like a forest more like a hill.

The vast emptiness still confuses me but,

Rest assured that you won’t see.

Lots of things like in others minds cause,

This one is mine.

Since its mine I have the temptations of asking, 

whether its worth to stay alive

But like the hypocrite I am,

I advertise the idea that life is worth living.

Once again I find myself asking 

“If I don’t think I’m worth it,

Then who will.

Lost in my own mind,

Not like a forest more like a hill”

And on this hill,

You will find a windmill.

You notice the absence of wind,

And try to push it yourself.

Because without power,

What will help in making your struggles louder.

Finding validation in others,

Since you can’t grasp it yourself.

Now I find new meaning to these questions

“If I don’t think I’m worth it,

Then who will.

Lost in my own mind,

Not like a forest more like a hill” '

58,"i had medium heavy to light Depression for 3 years now! my parents are basically not Living together cause my Father doesn't want to be with my mother, though they are not divorced!  
i had cut myself in the past and after 6 months of Depression some Friends told my parents and i went to a Teenager and child mental Hospital for 6 weeks!  
Depression came back after a few months… i met a Young women, we had a relationship for 2 years, went through nice and hard times, ended with me being sick of her telling me that i am the Problem in our relationship cause i am not writing her but she did the same...  
so now, 3 months after we broke up i fell in love with a good (female) friend! we were at a few Events together, bday parties, movie nights with some friends and her! though i still dont rlly know her...  


so i have Friends, a fairly good-paying Job, can buy what i want, am in love… and still Depression f\*cks me over anytime in the evening

59,"I’m a 22 year old female, and I don’t know why I always feel so hopeless, because I’m sure I have potential, but I just feel disgusting and worthless.

I’m really lonely, but it’s hard to reach out to people and make friends. Most of the time all I want is someone to talk to. 

I really want a relationship, but I know I’m way too messed up emotionally and mentally to seek one out, so I watch a lot of porn everyday and fantasize what it would be like to have physical contact with someone else. That’s why I’m so disgusted with myself.

Eating is one of the few things that makes me feel better, so lately I’ve been binge eating, and I’ve gained like 20 pounds over the past few months and I know that’s just making it harder for me to eventually find the type of relationship I dream about everyday. 

I just want to get to a point where I can work on myself, but the loneliness and hopelessness of never finding a relationship/friends keeps me stagnant. 

I guess I really just wanted to vent somewhere. I know no one is going to ever want to date me/be friends with me until I pull myself together, but I just feel stuck.

60,He went out with friends last night and came home super late and completely hammered. As he was walking into the room he woke up our baby. He then showed me he had a knife and kept saying how he wanted to kill himself. He kept putting it up to his throat or wrist saying we’d be better off without him. He thinks he’s a failure as a husband and dad. No matter how much I tell him he is amazing he doesn’t believe it. It took a few hours but I finally got him to go to bed and I stayed up all night watching him. I don’t know what to do. I’ve been trying to get him to go see his dr and he’s gotten medicine but refuses to take it. He doesn’t want to go to therapy. I don’t know how to help when he refuses help everyday.

 At first i thought it was my mistake for being too sensitive and fragile, but soon enough things started to get uncomfortable, usually i am not so short tempered to lose myself in rage, although at that time i was close to it. Instead of raging and multiplying unnecessary problems i thought -""If dealing with them is so much pain in the neck, then why should i even bother with that"".

 After that thought i replaced myself with a simple mask of friendliness (being friendly with everyone), which indeed was just another mistake becuase now i don't have anyone to call ""friend"" and a method to define myself. Guess visual novel rules work in real life too.

75,"By all rights my life should be happy. I grew up neither poor nor rich. I wanted for nothing that I needed. My parents were loving and did a fantastic job of raising us. I had really close neighbor friends, and made friends throughout school as I grew up. I'm told I'm handsome. I played sports for a decade, and was in band for 6 years. I showed a natural aptitude for learning early on, was placed on the fast track for academics and was constantly motivated by my teachers and parents, leading to a flawless academic record and admission to a prestigious college.

That's why I hate complaining about my life, why I never wanted to admit to possibility of being depressed. I don't even have good justification to feel shitty like the rest of you. No sexual abuse, no childhood trauma, no drugs, not stupid or ugly (so they say atleast), no crippling poverty, nothing. It's just my fucked personality.

I never hated myself, never thought there was anything wrong with who I was. I'm misanthropic and I'm certain I have schizoid personality disorder. I've never been thoughtful towards others, never really cared about my friends like they might've cared about me. Never bought anyone Christmas gifts, never remembered birthdays. Always viewed love and friendship as useless and fake constructions that would dissolve and turn toxic at the first hint of true adversity when people's true colors showed. I shit you not, I tried my damnedest to never smile in middle school because I wholeheartedly believed showing emotion was a weakness that could be weaponized against you. I have absolutely no idea where this line of thought came from. I thought I was better off alone. It's extremely convenient most of the time to only worry about yourself. I've only ever trusted myself. I've only ever relied on myself, and it was reinforced by the 'success' I always had in school. As is the story of many other 'academically inclined' kids, I put all my effort and care into doing well in school instead of cultivating friendships. And any time I did have to make friends, I spent it playing videogames because they were far more interesting and entertaining than friends. I didn't make a single lasting friend in highschool. Of course, if you've managed to slog through my ramblings thus far, you get the picture, and the setup. I don't want to bore you too horribly with more details. But to those of you who are reading, not out of a sense of goodwill and desire to help me, but because you want to feel less shitty about yourself and take satisfaction in the pain and struggling of anyone who came from a happier place and fell harder than you, I get you so well. I am that part of you.

So the present. As you might imagine, I've never been in a relationship. Shocker I know. I'm attending college out-of-state, so I have literally 0 friends and family around. I'm unsure of my major and it causes me great anxiety. I have no one to confide in.

I'm 21. My youth is gone and there's nothing to be done about it. I'm a young adult with no friends, and the loneliness is finally beginning to pain me. I've always been a loner but I was always certain any pain or unhappiness I felt up until now would've been much worse had I had friends or SOs to lose. The main problem is I feel it's too late. Too late to try to change. I've tread the road this far, and with a certain sense of spite and conviction, I feel like I should see it through.

I just want to know if I should be a self-glorified martyr to a pointless cause, or if I should try to change myself to be a person who could be happier. If it's the latter, it would be nice to know if and how any of you with a similar outlook were able to change your perspective, because I'm pretty deep set in my ways.",0

I have past trauma including issues from childhood and an abusive marriage. I grew up very unhappy, feeling unsafe and very anxious. I got bullied severely at school and also by adults. I got married young and my ex husband was verbally and physically abusive and also wouldn't work for many years so I had a lot of pressure on me for years to support 2 people and take care of the house while studying for 9 years.

I'm at the point now where I left my ex husband but it was a tough time for someone who finds change very stressful. I'm in another relationship, I moved in with my boyfriend, changed jobs, my dog died... literally everything from my old life is gone. 

I should be happy that I'm in a good relationship and had many changes. But Im so unhappy. I cry so many times a day. For years on end I feel nauseous and tired and sick every single day. I have physical health problems that contribute a lot to the depression. I feel so unwell every day and no doctor has ever helped me. I have some abnormalities but they don't think they are a huge deal.

 I recently saw psychologist to try and cope better but she said she couldn't help me. She said I am coping because I still go to work and said the sessions don't seem to be helping so not to rebook. I meditate, up until recently I was jogging regularly, I cook a lot of my meals, started a vegetable garden with the help of my boyfriend, I sit in the sun, I bought prepaid yoga classes to ensure I do it, I was about to join a new gym as I just moved to this area with my bf so gad to give up my old gym. It's not like I am lying around choosing to worsen my depression. I try really hard. I hold down a job and clean our house daily. 

So a few days ago I injured my back at work and struggled to walk at all or breathe, I went to hospital. It's improved a fair bit but the pain keeps changing places now and moving up my spine. I can't exercise anymore and my depression is so bad. 

I am a complete burden to anyone that knows me. My boyfriend is a caring petson but he's burned out by me because he says depression causes me to be selfish and only focus on myself. I feel like such an awful person and am not saying that for pity. I feel like his spirit would be like a smiling child who was looking forward to our future together and I just metaphorically kicked him in the face like a cruel monster. I accidentally tricked him into loving me and being with me because I was on a type of high when I left my ex husband and I acted happier and better than I was. I became reliant on romance and sex from my bf like an addiction. He probably thought I'd just stay as I was. But we've moved in together now so I'm not getting dressed up to see him and anticipating visiting each other, not pretending to be someone else etc so I'm not getting that high of that thrill so my depression has surfaced a lot more in front of him. I feel like a liar, a fraud and I should never have let him get into a relationship with me. I am so sorry that I was so selfish to do that. I ruin all mens lives who are with me. 

Im addicted to alcohol as well. I am a total mess. 

I dont want to fuck up his life anymore. I don't want to be nauseous and exhausted and in pain anymore. I dont want to keep searching for 100  ways to improve. I feel done with it all.. 20 years battling this, physically and mentally feeling so crap. I just don't have anything left. 

Now I have aggravated yet another area of my back from crying. There is just not much hope left. I pray and I try so hard and my health only gets worse. I just think I am ready to die now. I just dont want to do it anymore. I hoped i wpuld get better in my 20s but now it's just gone on too long in my 30s. I agree with people who say suicide is selfish but I am already considered selfish. The grief people would feel about me, I dont want to cause that bit at least they'd be free to get on with their lives without me the black cloud ruining everything. But maybe they would glorify me in my death and remember me as way better than I actually was and be sad over an imaginary version of me forever. I just wish there was a way I could check out, without hurting people. I wish I could erase their memory of me. 

Tl;dr I have long term depression, no treatments worked, I tried therapy recently and it didn't help, I am a burden on my partner and ruin his dreams, I feel sick every day from health problems and wish I could kill myself without hurting others ",0
84,"It wasn't much. Only 3 cuts, two of them didn't even draw any blood, and the other just a little bit. When I saw the cut start to darken though, it felt good... I can't stand pain, but I think I liked it. My knife is really dull though, so I couldn't draw much blood without making it hurt a lot more than with a sharp one. I tried to file it sharper, but that only worked a little bit. I also punched myself in the face. I've never done this before. I've bitten myself through my sleeve when I'm stressed, but I've never taken the time to intentionally hurt myself. I kinda liked it...

I wanted to kill myself, and this was my alternative.

85,"Basically, I’m a 27 year old guy. I spent, up until 22 years old, walled off from the world playing video games. Didn’t care about anything. All I wanted to do every day was sit in front of my computer.. it’s like a shell I was stuck in.

I started to break out of my shell a little bit around that age. Started to go out, started to meet people and do social shit, got a job, started messing with girls. 

Now, before that “breaking out of the shell” thing happened, I NEVER felt like I needed a girl in my life to make me happy, until my first ex girlfriend broke up with me when I was 24. I was fucking miserable and felt like I wanted to die. After that, I felt like I couldn’t be happy without a girl.. kept trying to replace my ex with other girls just for the sake of having a girl in my life.

Age 25, I reconnected with a girl from high school who I always kind of had a thing for and kind of secretly always wanted to be with. We started dating, and the honeymoon stage was amazing. It felt so good for like 6 months.. and then we moved in together and then I kind of started to get sad again. Nowhere near as intense as it was post breakup, but kind of unhappy to the point where I had thoughts like.. “I got what I wanted, I got the apartment and the girl of my dreams and I’m still not satisfied.”

That thought process ruined that relationship. We lasted a year and a half, and she ended up leaving me because she felt like I stopped trying. Now, I’m MISERABLE again.. unhappy to the point of suicidal thoughts.. and I can’t put my finger on what this is.

This is kind of why I think this is a deeper problem that I maybe need medication for. When I had what I miss so badly right now, it wasn’t that special to me. Life kind of still felt incomplete and dull, but I wasn’t miserable. It’s almost like she was a bandaid on a gaping wound, covering up a much bigger problem that I have with myself.

I want to get as many opinions as I can before I get myself on medication. I want it to be a last resort thing and I just want to know what people think.",0

87,"Hey guys, about 2 years ago (I was 19) I was in an 80 mile an hour head on collision going back to college. Everyone survived, I received pretty bad leg damage but that's all. The lady I hit on the other hand received 2 broken legs, 2 broken arms and had to eat out of a tube in the hospital for 3 months. She had a family and 2 kids and I can't help but to think I ruined her life without any punishment. I get to walk around everyday like my life was before with only pain, PTSD, anxiety,  and depression. Some days I can't even get out of bed, I don't want to go to the store, I sit at my computer staring at the monitor without doing anything. As much as I love my girlfriend I feel so bad to talk to her about it because I don't want to burden her, when I'm sad she gets sad so I put on my happy face. She'll usually ask if I'm okay and I tell her 'Yeah, I'm fine' and put on a smile.

95,"i was a bright kid. i started reading at the age of two and people loved to tell me how smart i was. but around fifth grade things started to change. putting in the effort required to maintain friendships and do schoolwork was hard, and it only got worse from there. by high school i was nearly friendless and barely scraping by in all my classes -- i only graduated because of a special ed program and a teacher i owe my life to.

present day, i'm 23 and a college dropout with no sense of purpose or ability to do anything, really. my parents enable my behavior by letting me play video games all day and supporting me like the dumb leech that i am. i feel like it'd be super easy to get out of this rut if i only put in a little effort, but it seems impossible. i could work on a resume, learn to code, do anything that could help me succeed in life but i deem it ""too much work"" and never try, or try for a brief while and give up because it's too hard or doesn't provide the serotonin/dopamine boost i so desperately crave.

i don't know if i'm lazy or just severely depressed. everything feels hopeless and pointless and although i don't want to kill myself i definitely want to die. i just want to have a normal brain that works right so i can see if that would change things for me but i've been on meds for almost ten years and been going to therapy for longer and nothing seems to work. as time goes on i'm just digging myself a deeper hole and i hate it.

96,"Some context: I grew up in a small town in the prairies, in the same house, with the same people at school from when I was born to when I graduated high school. I am just finishing my second year of university and I am absolutely miserable. I can't help but constantly think back to my days in high school when I had so many more friends and life was just fun. I've only seen like 2 of my friends since I graduated because i moved to a different city for university and I've had a really hard time making any new friends here. Last night I had a dream that had a bunch of my old friends in it and it was such a happy dream, I've been hung up all day thinking about how those days are gone forever. I miss those friends so much, but my depression has destroyed the person I used to be. I try to put myself out there but instead of coming across as clever and quick witted, I'm just an awkward dumbass. I'm visiting my parents in my hometown currently and when I went for a walk last night I broke down multiple times just from seeing stuff that remind me of my life before I graduated. I know I need to move on and find new happiness but with my depression it truly feels like it's impossible, I don't feel like the same person anymore.",0

Some people start doing things because it's fun to them. And I'm overwhelmed with everything. Even if I put some effort into things, I'm very below-average. There's no reason to keep trying, I fail every time.

100,"I’m 22 years old and I graduated high school in 2014. I grew up in an upper middle class household and was pretty much spoiled rotten. I attended a private school up until my sophomore year and transferred to a public school due to bad grades. Back then, college didn’t really seem like a choice so I dove straight into my first semester in the Fall of 2014. That summer, I started my first job (an ice cream shop) I would basically work and get off late (usually around 1am) and have to be up for my classes at 8am. Being that it was my first job, I felt like I had to work at it for a while, even while attending college. I ended up failing out my first semester and my parents were really disappointed. I took a year off and just worked some shitty minimum wage job. Like I said, I was spoiled rotten so I decided to work so I wouldn’t feel like an absolute useless piece of shit. Usually people would take a year off to “find what they want to do”, when in reality I was just working to work. I didn’t give much thought to what I wanted to do next. After that year of working, I quit and went back to school. I found that, for me, juggling both school and work was virtually impossible. So I started taking things more seriously and got my grades back up. It had been that way up until I would say the beginning of 2018. My grades started going down again and I am currently failing 1-2 of my 4 classes I’m taking. (I am taking the minimum amount of credits for a “full time” student because I am beyond lazy, but a part of me also feels like even one more class would just be too much to handle).  I am currently a Junior going on my 5th year of college. Even up until now, I don’t have a clue what I’m doing. I feel like I’m wasting my parents money (which I am), and just lack motivation to finish. It makes me angry that I don’t have to work to go to school and yet I’m still failing out. Majority of my peers that I went to high school with already graduated and I know it’s not a race but it doesn’t help my state of mind knowing that I didn’t finish with them.

I noticed within the last 6 months that my depression and anxiety of college is more prevalent than ever. I lie awake at night wondering what I’m doing with my life and if I’ll amount to anything. I wouldn’t say I’m suicidal, but I do have thoughts every now and then of what it would be like to just end it all....however I know that I wouldn’t actually pull through with it. I just feel so stuck and in a never ending loop of college. I’ve racked up nearly $30k of my parents money spent on my tuition and I feel like absolute shit that 1) I haven’t finished yet and 2) i don’t have the motivation or drive to. ",0
101,"what should I do outside?
the weather is no nice and all I do is sitting in bed because I don't know what I should do outside alone. I don't want to seem stupid and everytime I go out without a plan I just buy something that I don't want and go home.",0
102,"First, I'm not depressed, at least compared to what I know/experienced about depression. I just want to get a few opinions about my current state. I don't know if this is the correct sub to ask that but I think it fits. The text might turn out a bit longer and English is not my first language, sorry for that. If anythings unclear just let me know. 
(I'm a 20yo guy, if that matters) 

So basically, I don't think that I'm depressed but it feels like I am, or close to being it. I know, that sounds weird, but let me explain.
 I'm a person who loves to go out with friends and just have fun, I like to make them smile and just enjoy my life. I get along with most of my colleagues as well, all together I don't have a problem socializing. I'm basically the 'oh, that guy? I don't really know him but he seems alright' - guy at your school. I don't have a problem with that, even if no one actually knows me closer. That's okay for me.
Also I can't complain about my life, I've got a job and a home.
 However, whenever I'm on my own and I'm not doing anything, I just feel like I'm completely lost. Usually I get home at 5pm, play guitar and do some running.. and that's it. I'm done. It's not that I don't know what to do but simply that I don't want to do anything at all. And as soon as that feeling starts my mind goes crazy and for example starts doubting everything that's gonna happen in the future and has happened in the past. And I know that it's stupid and I usually ignore it but it low-key still hits me.
I dont get it. For example, I get home after playing Billard with my friends and instantly after I shut my door and wrapped myself in blankets it starts. And always the same questions 'why do I even care' and 'does someone actually care' and 'what if' and so on. I simply don't know where that comes from. Maybe it's because I care more about others than about myself. I actually had a relationship because of that. She had clinical depression and attempted suicide a few times, (one time in front of me, which was the first time I cried in over 8 years which isn't really normal as well) but I knew that she wasn't depressed when she was with me. She wasn't happy either, but she wasn't depressed. I obviously never told her, but it was hell for me. I didn't know if I would meet her the next day, if she would response to my texts simply because for a moment depression wanted to end it, not her. But that was a while ago, we broke up and I'm fine now, no worries. That was just an example. But that explains my mindset pretty well. I really want to help others and I'd take everything on me to make it work. It's stupid, it's not good for my health, I know, but that's something I won't stop doing and something that I'm sort of good at. 
So, back to the actual topic, there's something else that's not normal, or doesn't feel normal. I don't show any sad emotions at all. I don't even know if I feel them  'correctly'. A while ago some family members and close friends passed away (again, I'm alright, no worries) and the moment I've got told about that I literally felt nothing at all and it really  scared me. I never thought that I could be that cold and don't feel anything at all. The only thing inside my head was 'shit, why xyz and not me'. Actually, I felt sad but not the kind of sad where you start crying. The kind of sad where you just know that something bad happened.
And lastly, thinking about death. I fear death, I don't even like talking about it. I fear it because I know that eventually I'll leave someone behind who loves me and simply thinking about that makes me emotional, in fact more emotional than I felt when I heard that xyz died. I really don't think that this is normal or good. But at the same time I don't really care. I mean, I don't want to die and I want to live, but at the same time I don't care if I die. 
Usually I don't even tell anyone how am I feeling, simply because I don't think that anyone would actually care and because I don't want to put my problems onto someone else's shoulders. Sometimes I think it would help if there was someone I can come home to, simply to sit next to me and just be there. But that doesn't make any sense either. I don't want to make anyone's day worse because of me being in a mood. In fact, it all sounds stupid to me. I feel like I'm someone who just complains about something that's not important at all. People would probably say 'meh he's just looking for attention etc'. There are people who have it worse, I shouldn't be complaining.
 I've been ignoring that for years know, I never told anyone about it and I never showed it. I think it would be best if I kept doing that. 

Everything that I've written down kinda sums up what's on my mind before I sleep, when I wake up or when I'm alone. But for example it doesn't happen when I'm outside and just walk around, or when I listen to music. I'm still alone, but I don't think about that. Only when there's nothing for me to do and I space out. 
But I don't think I'm depressed. I can't be, I've got everything I need, my life isn't that bad. Why would I be depressed? Everytime I think about that I always tell myself to 'man up' and get over it. 

Is that a sign of depression, should I look for professional help or am I just in a mood everytime I'm on my own? 
I really appreciate any comment and wish you a nice day, take care. You're great (:

104,"Ive been struggling for years fighting against my depression. Its usually been one bad situation after another starting with my aunt dying when i was little.

Then i spent seven years or so until i was 18 with a girlfriend(around the same time as my great gpa) and looking back at that after therapy was abusive. 

I connected with a girl from my graduating class at college and she helped me get on track there with therapy and being my number one supporter. I had tried several times to end it all in 8 years and have numerous scars from self harm. But i was getting better. I matured more and found self worth and happiness. I felt as if i had finally fought off my clinical depression. I found love with a girl i met and recently got engaged. 

As i write this today i no longer feel i found my own happiness with myself. Im back on medication and have no help besides that. My supporter is gone and my fiancé doesn’t help me at all.

I hope everyone in this sub finds what they're looking for. If anyone is going through anything similar then you certainly have my respect and words of encouragement. The same goes for everyone else in this sub.

I want us all to be happy. One day

112,"I'm going to attempt to make this as short as possible.

I've had a history of anxiety and depression, the latter was never super bad or debilitating until recently where it's teamed up hardcore with my anxiety and I'm unsure how to get back to where I was. 

I started a new medication in the summer of 2017 and it helped almost immediately with my anxiety to the point by January 2018 I had finally gotten a part time job. All of 2018 was pretty great mentally and life wise.

Near the tail end of 2018 I started smoking weed, started casually and eventually got to the point of me smoking it almost the entire time I was home. I didn't notice any adverse side effects until I'd be sober and I would get massive anxiety attacks and nausea, the only thing that would help would be to smoke. I ended up taking a month of work in February and quit smoking entirely. I'm about two months sober now. During this time my pill dosage was doubled.

I started work again at the beginning of March and thought I was back to normal, but the last couple weeks have been really hard again. I'm sleeping a lot, crying more, and just really hating life. I've been having some bad thoughts and just an overall feeling of complete dread, hopelessness, and embarrassment. 

I've been thinking about taking more time off work, and maybe even quitting altogether. I love my work, and my coworkers. They have been so nice and supportive of me and I don't want to be an unreliable coworker so I feel like quitting or going on an indefinite leave would be better than me calling in sick constantly. I feel absolutely empty and dead inside. Nothing is bringing me even an ounce of happiness, I just want to sleep. 

My parents have been very supportive but I still feel like I'm embarrassing them, I'm 22 and feel like a complete failure. If I can't handle 3 shifts a week I must be absolute trash. 

I don't expect any sort of insta solution from this post it was kind of a way to get my thoughts out I guess.

114,"Last night I (20M) went out drinking with my best friend(19F). We're pretty close, we're both going through depression, we both had shitty childhoods. We took a final bottle of wine and went to a park at the edge of a local forest, sat on a nice bench at the very edge of the treeline and just talked. At one point I said something that kinda killed the conversation and I apologised for making things awkward. She just said ""Then let me make them more awkward"" and kissed me.

It was just...incredible. It was my first kiss, at 20, and as pathetic as it sounds, it was the best thing to happen to me in ages. I felt like, for those few mins, the depression and anxieties and every burden were just.. gone. And worst of all, I felt.. alive, more alive than I've felt in fucking ages. Life was finally exciting for a few minutes.

I told her it was my first kiss (she was a bit surprised apparently), we talked some more, kissed some more (and it was just as great as the first time), and eventually it was 4:30 am and time to go home already. I was just.. happy. I was so excited I took 2 hours to fall asleep, slept only 2 hours, and somehow woke up (today) without a hangover and fully rested and.. smiling. Actually woke up smiling. We had plans to meet again, I went to meet her..

---

At one point she said last night had just been a drunken mistake and said we should just both pretend it never happened. 20 mins later I went ""home"". To the same park as the other night (it's near my house and its the place I go when I need to be alone). And there I just.. cried, for 45 minutes, on that bench. Full-on ugly cried with hiccups and all. Got home, realised I didnt eat in 14-ish hours, and slept 2 hours in the last 48. And.. I dont care. It just.. hurts too badly. After years of my life being a living nightmare, of feeling like an empty shell of a person, I finally had a good night. I finally felt fucking happy and excited about life and fucking **ALIVE**.

And it's gone. It's over. It was... only a mistake. The only time my life was anything but a fucking living nightmare was nothing more than a drunken mistake. I dont blame her. She does deserve way better.

But I just want the ground to open up and swallow me whole and fucking get it over with. I don't want to go *back*. There's just this.. void in my chest, like I can't even breathe right. I have a strong feeling tonight will be the night I relapse on my self-harming old habit.

And yeah, I'm pathetic. I dont even know why I'm posting this. Maybe I just want to get it off my chest, to put it into words. Maybe I just want to be validated or maybe I just want some stupid lies about how ""it gets better"". All I know it, for a night, I felt OKAY, I felt what it's like to not be depressed, to not dread tomorrow, to not wish for the pain to stop. And now it's all gone. ",0
115,"Exactly a year ago I was depressed. I would sometimes cry or feel like crying out of the blue (even though I never, ever cried). I felt as if my golden days were behind me (even though I'm 20 yo). I felt that I had chosen the wrong degree, had no career options whatsoever that I liked, and would be forever frustrated in my life. I isolated myself from my best friends and people, and just felt hopeless in general. Even though I'd return to my ""normal"" self within a couple of weeks, I'd eventually fall back into a bad cycle. And that was despairing for me.

Today, I feel better than ever. I haven't been in a bad cycle for many months now. Rather than feeling as if I have no career prospect that excites me, I now have so many exciting prospects that the problem is choosing just one. I'm once again hopeful about the future. And I'm sure that my golden days are still ahead of me. I can't wait to get my first job and build a career in something I'm passionate about. To meet the special one and build a family. To live my life.

So... Not wanting to be clichê, but if you're going through a rough patch, just hang on in there and before you know it you'll find the light at the end of the tunnel. It may seem like that's impossible, because of how your mind has cornered you into a dark and twisted perspective of the world and of yourself, but trust me, it's not.",0
116,"Depression lies to you. 
Depression reminds you of all the shit you’ve done wrong. 
Depression tries to make you believe that you’re a terrible person. 
Depression is like a constant weight on your shoulders, increasing in weight. 
Depression makes you imagine your funeral, and nobody showing up or showing negative emotions. 
Would the cry? Would they even care to show up?
Depression wants you to believe you’re worthless. 
Depression wants to ruin you. 
And sometimes, no matter how strong you are, depression wins. 
Depression is a beast, a leech, sucking the life out of you. 
Depression makes you sleep all day and then feel bad for missing a beautiful day. 
Depression is your enemy. 
Depression is your worst nightmare. 
Depression wants you to believe that you’re alone.

118,"Video games:
I've never had anyone to play with. I just want to be curb stomped to death when I see everyone say how much they love their Discord servers full of gaming friends they can talk to and play with anytime, and no one ever likes the same games as me. I can't find people in real life, people online, people in the games with me - no one. I have no one to play with. I hate video games now. I just get sad looking at all the titles I used to play and seeing EVERYONE ELSE have fun playing them. 

Art:
I just cringe. I don't like my style. I have no inspiration anymore either and no one pays me to draw like other people get paid. I hate it. This is the one thing I really wanted to try out as a career but no - I don't think any of it is good enough. I wish I could cut off my hands or something and get new ones implanted if it means they could draw better. 

Animals:
Love animals. Always have, more than most. I've had to give up two animals this year, yes, just these 4 months of 2019, due to dietary problems they had and can't be resolved and my family didn't want to deal with their issues anymore. I think of them everyday. Especially because they bonded with ME. My kitten would sleep on my neck and purr himself to sleep every night and would come when I called him and cried when I left. My husky would howl all day when I was gone and practically had happy seizures when I returned. Now they're both alone at their shelters, probably hating me. ",0
119,"Hello. About 2 weeks ago I was put on a 5150 hold. When I was in the ER I tried to kill myself. Obviously I wasn't thinking clearly at the time, as I was suicidal. That is my defense for how awful my attempt to stop breathing was.
I was hoping I could drown myself. So I asked for some water. I got a cup and then some of it spilled. Then I failed at choking. So I tried again when the nurse wasn't looking. So I start choking on it again but the guy jerks around or something and I accidentally drink the remaining water.
I felt pretty foolish after this. So when they put me in the hospital I tried again. Only this time, with an entire pitcher if water. But right when I'm about to take my first glass of water, the doctor comes in to ask some questions. Foiled again. I confessed to trying to off myself again, because I couldn't answer his questions honestly so I just sat there until that confession came out.
Anyway, I thought my attempt at suicide was just embarrassingly, comedically pathetic, but I'm sure my family is just happy I'm not better at killing myself.
And by the way, I have learned that if I'm stuck in the ER again, I'm not running unless I have a really good reason. It took over a week for my skin to heal after getting tackled, and I did not get far. Not even to the end of the hallway. They hire former track stars for nurses apparently.",0

122,"For the longest time I haven't had any feelings about anything.  I feel empty all the time. I don't feel happiness or sad. I just feel nothing. I have no feelings about my family. Sure I'd be sad if one of them passed away, but while they're here I feeling nothing towards them. No love, no hate. I moved out of home two months ago and I don't miss them at all. I always wanted to move out and when I finally did, I just had no feelings towards the situation.

It's similar with my SO. We've been together for a year and a half and it was great in the beginning. But now when I'm with her that emptiness is still there. I'm not excited to see her after being apart. When we're together, it's just blank. I feel like I have nothing to give, yet I don't want to break up. 

My current job is demanding and full on. Long hours. Late finishes and early starts. This job brings me no joy or satisfaction. It's more blankness. Right now, my whole life just seems like 'eh'. 

There are other factors in my life that could possibly contribute to this but I just want to know if this feeling is depression. I didn't know where else to go.

123,"My mom was recently diagnosed with Type 2 Diabetes as well as severe anxiety, which was disappointing and upsetting to me. I have been taking care of her and helping her stay calm with the diagnosis, but it has been quite difficult to calm her down.

As for my social life, the number of friends I have is going to start to come down soon because one of them is moving away to another state for an internship, so we won't be able to see one another anymore. I have tried to make new friends (and keep trying to do so) but it is a slow process. I still have the rest of my friend group pretty much intact.

As for employment, lately I have been applying to around 10-15 jobs a week, but it has become harder to find a job now that my mom needs someone to care for her due to her diabetes, and despite interviews, I have not yet gotten hired.

The search for an SO has been going a bit sour as well, I am taking a little break from Tinder and am on Match. After one day I have messaged around 15 people and nothing yet, but its not my time to give up.

I also plan on going away in two months and have been doing excellent in school and with my hobbies, so those are good things. I have been traveling places with a worker that comes to help me twice a week as well as doing things with the friends I have. I also recently joined a line dancing class, am still going to chess club, and have been having a good time exercising. Another thing I am doing is taking action against climate change by writing to Congress and taking action against various causes.

I will continue to persevere, despite the fact things have been falling apart again, though more slowly than before, and things are still going relatively strong since I have built a pretty solid foundation with some things, and am trying hard with others, but no avail. I still count trying as being strong.

my last ex, tried to take her life. i found her in her car dying, and i held her in my arms and brought her to the hospital. i stayed with her, skipping school to make sure she was okay.

129,"Hello again...

I bet you guys are probably getting sick of me venting my sheer negativity here, but I gotta get something off my chest.


I put on a comedic persona whenever I'm in public. People tend to think I'm a happy and overall funny guy because of it. I tend to make stupid jokes quite often... however whenever I'm in a really dark mood, I'd crack jokes about suicide and drinking bleach. People would just laugh at it, thinking that it's funny, when I'm secretly half-serious.

I show no discernable change in my facial expression (at least not that I know of because I've never been confronted by anyone in my school, teachers or classmates about my emotional health) because I take on an unreadable, blank expression when I'm silently screaming in my own head.

So... encountered a situation in which I my grade in a foreign language class dipped to a D for a single quarter in the first semester (two quarters per semester). The teacher contacted my guidance counselor, and I had a meeting with the counselor in order to discuss what was happening.  

Now here comes the hard part...

In truth, my grades were tanking because I could not focus in class due to a nonstop mantra of suicidal ideation in my head. Sometimes I felt like literally breaking down and crying, but I suppressed these urges in order to not make a scene that my parents would probably complain about when I get home. So the only direction my mental health and quite frankly, my future was going was downhill.

I also remembered the instance in which I was nearly admitted to the psych ward; long story short, someone close died, and I kinda lost it... said I wanted to kill myself, principal called, parents didn't react very well, was hospitalized, and came back to school. All I'm going to say is that I had never felt so alone in my entire existence, and I'm a lonely piece of shit 90% of the time.

So... I decided to tiptoe carefully around this one for my own sake.

What I told my guidance counselor was simply part of the story, I felt like there was a crushing weight inside of my brain. It wasn't a lie, because it was true, there was a crushing weight sensation inside of my head. What I avoided to mention was the fact that the sensation originated from raging thoughts of suicide that were growing increasingly harder to control. In fact, junior year of high school was the time in which I seriously researched suicide methods. Heck, I even ditched my  gaming hobby in favor of looking up ways to just end it.

I did this because... if I told anyone that I was considering suicide, it would probably make my life worse than it already was. Morbidly enough, I only picked back up academically when I told myself that I could end it whenever life grew too much. I didn't feel like I had anyone to run to, because quite frankly, I didn't think anyone gave a damn. So I could only be alone and try to survive.

As it stands... I'm  a senior in high school and I don't think I have much of a future... so I'm just sitting here... waiting for my life to end while browsing memes. I feel pretty much alone in my journey; I know my problems are too heavy for many people, who, quite frankly, don't need the negativity that I carry to burden them in their lives. Hence, I feel as if my only option is to sit here and rot in my depression, least till death comes.",0

Over the last year I felt like I have started to get my shit together. Been working out four times a week and and am currently in the best shape of my life.

So I started to get some confidence and thought I would give dating a try. 

I met this girl and it seemed to be going pretty well, or so I thought. However after I noticed she wasn't really putting in any effort into our conversions I directly asked her whether or not I'm wasting my time. That's when she decided to end it.

Now I'm a bit gutted about it, she was great and we had a lot in common, but I had only been seeing her a month so I'm not too attached.

However the fact that she suddenly seemed off and ended it after I thought it was going well. It basically felt like getting hit by a truck for my self esteem. 

It's brings back constant thoughts that I'm just not  good enough or experienced enough in relationships that no one will want to be with me. It's made me feel pretty bad about the whole thing and now bringing anxieties back.

Also it has made me doubt if I should ever be in a relationship non stop because if I struggle this bad after a month. If I ever got into a long term relationship and it ends. I honestly think it might push me over the edge.

I still don't have stable friends. I have a boyfriend but I know he will leave once he sees how bad of a state I really am in. Everyone does. I've tried talking to people. I've tried meds. My family doesn't understand depression. I don't mean to blame, but honestly, it's their fault I had a shitty start. I basically raised myself. 
I try and reach out and ask for help when I've had panic attacks and crying fits and self harm issues, but they just yell at me. Mom tries to push healthy shit on me thinking it'll fix me, but yet she herself is in a bad health situation and goes to the hospital for appointments every 2 weeks. 
Kind of hypocritical, right? Pushing things on me when they don't work for her. No one can reason with me. No one can speak any sense. They don't get how I feel, and they don't want to. I don't want to keep suffering if this is what life has in store. ",0

&amp;#x200B;

Hey so I have had depression and anxiety for about 8 years now. I have a job interview tomorrow at a movie theatre, and I'm super nervous. If I end up getting the job I am afraid of messing up things ad being slow, since those are the exact reasons I was let go from my last job. That manager was awful though, and expected me to be as quick as her (I was a cashier at a busy Chinese restaurant), even though she had been there 8 years and I had only been there for 2 months at that point. Not even past my probation period. 

I am worried that if I'm not perfect like everyone else there I will be let go, and I will find myself without a job again. I'm going into a new college program in September, and need a job to help pay for school, as well as pay for residence fees for the school I'm at now. Any words of encouragement are welcome.

TL;DR : Have a job interview and am afraid of being let go if I am not fast enough or if I make mistakes",0
150,"I haven’t been able to feel anything for anyone else since me and my ex-girlfriend broke up 5 years ago almost to this date, and I haven’t really had any hope that I could ever love anyone again for a long time. 

Last summer, a friend of mine sort of popped up in my life again, another girl that I knew before my ex and someone that I briefly had a thing with. She’s the one exception, I’ve always had feelings for her as long as I’ve known her, which is over 10 years at this point. 

She kinda came and went, and I thought there was some kind of problem between us, so I finally just called her last night to talk about it, and cleared up a bunch of stuff which was good. But at some point she mentioned, she thought I might have had feelings for her and she didn’t really know what to do about that, and I felt like I had to be honest with her and admitted that I do have those feelings, and also said it might not be a good idea for us to hang out much anymore and I didn’t know if I could do that and be fair to her anymore given how I feel.

I feel pretty devastated. I haven’t had any hope of meeting anyone going back to basically 2014. I was really close to wanting to kill myself last summer before she showed up again. I haven’t really ever loved anyone as long as I have this girl, not even my ex. I was really hoping this was going to work out and I guess deep down I really believed it would.

I don’t think there’s anyone else out there for me. I don’t even have attraction for anyone any more even as simple as just seeing women I think are pretty or hot out in public anymore, I just don’t feel anything. I feel like this was my last chance for happiness and I blew it.",0
151,"I believe we all have that series of games that relate with us in some way, a way where it connects with out inner-self and isolation.

Games like Silent Hill, evoking nightmares and horrors of the human mind.

System Shock, evoking the horror of survival, and possibly a masterpiece of showing what can really be created in a dark space.

For me, it's the Metro series, books and games. The game incorporates the greatest representation of isolation i've ever seen. For 5% of the game, you're with different characters and people for the ride. But the other 95%, you're alone, completely separated from anyone...and you're left to fend off whatever manner of beast or man on your own...just like life itself.

The games and books are such a gripping experience to keep you going and wondering how much suffering a person can take on their own in a way.

And that is why it is my favorite series to relate to my struggles.

153,"Hey guys.  In retrospect, I've been dealing with these weird feelings since around December/January, but I've only really started considering that I might have a real issue in the past month or so.  If anyone else has experienced these same feelings and it led to dysthymia, major depression, any type of anxiety, etc. please lmk your thoughts.

\-**Lack of social interest:** Decreased desire to socialize, this has led me to be far less outgoing and motivated to meet with new ppl than I used to be.  Almost feels like I just don’t have the energy to socialize with new people.  
\-**Decreasing social skills:** Due to less frequent and less enthusiastic socializing, I feel that my social skills have decreased because It's harder for me to genuinely be interested in conversations.  Harder for me to be as clever, enthusiastic and charismatic as I once felt.  Ofc, this leads to a negative spiral of not wanting to socialize, and even worse social skills.  
\-**Decreased libido:** Additionally, decreased libido/interest in talking w girls.  Libido's Still there, and can get intense at times.  It's just consistently far less than what It used to be…no idea why.  
\-**Always feeling discontent:** Persistent feeling or mild discontent and inability to just enjoy stuff as much as I felt like I used to.  For example, watching TV shows, listening to music, movies all feel more “bland” now and harder to really enjoy.  
Because of this, I often find myself not looking forward to things I believe I used to.  For example, seeing friends, parties, the weekend, going home after school, etc. because I know I’ll feel discontent and sorta uneasy/unsatisfied that whole time  
\-**Exhaustion/sleep craving:** I find myself just craving sleep far more often than I have in the past, and getting up earlier seems to have gotten even more difficult.  I literally fantasize so often about being able to sleep in.  
\-**Sleep difficulties:** Unfortunately…sometimes, I have trouble sleeping.  I’ll frequently have random (not really disturbing thoughts, just random and racing) when I go to bed at like 11:30 on weeknights.  Then before I know it, it’s 12:45 and I’m still wide awake cuz of these random thoughts.  
\-**Adderall not as effective:** Adderall doesn’t seem to provide the motivational boost, slight wellbeing and focus enhancement that it did last year.  It can actually amplify bad moods and anxious thoughts, with less effectiveness at blocking out negative distractions  
\-**IBS:** In October, I was diagnosed w/ IBS, which I know is potentially linked to anxiety/depression\\

159,"Hello, 

This is my first attempt to opening myself up to the world and sharing my struggles with depression. I don’t even really know where to begin. I guess I’ll start with when a little description and backstory to fill in the lines.

I am 25 years old, born and raised in Portland, Oregon. I am married to a woman that I fell in love with almost instantly. I have two beautiful children, a one year old boy, and a three year old  girl, but I do not get to see my daughter. Her mother and I split up a month after she was born, just packed her things and left to Washington after a blow out argument. I have seen my daughter twice since then, once during Christmas, and a random day in July of 2017. 

Her mother learned that I was seeing someone else, and she completely cut me off. Did not respond to calls or texts, and blocked me from all social media platforms. All while having her own new relationship with the man that now calls my little girl, dad. 

Now I know what you’re probably thinking (because I get this at least once or twice a week.) “You should take her to court and fight for visitation rights!” Yes, I really should, I want to, I need to. But something is holding me back, I want to ask for help, but I don’t know how or where to start.. 

My biggest issues with my depression are that I completely have no focus, I get lost in my own mind and completely disregard life around me, I cannot communicate properly with other people, and lastly I have absolutely no motivation or energy, regardless of how badly I want to do something and accomplish things.

It’s like my mind wants to do all these great things, learn and create, but my body bogs down and I can’t do anything. I want to get help, I want to do better, and I want to start fresh with a new outlook on life. I just need that initial push to seek out the help that I need.

My wife is amazing, she is truly my definition on beauty, she has a heart of gold, and she genuinely makes me feel happy, but there are also issues with my marriage as well. The biggest issue is our communication, I am somewhat soft spoken and find it difficult to communicate my true meaning properly. A way for me to cope with my both my shitty verbal communication skills as well as my depression, is through comedy and jokes. Be them appropriate, inappropriate, shocking humor, morbid humor, etc. if I can make people laugh, I feel better about myself. Which in turn, makes it seem like no one can take me seriously because I just make jokes 24/7. Now, my wife is also is pretty hot headed, and will have bursts of frustration and anger. There are times when I will try to talk and communicate with her, and I will make a stupid joke out of nowhere not realizing it, and it will set her off, which I in turn causes me to feel even worse about myself because I can’t get out with what I’m actually trying to say. 

There is also another issue between her and I that I am trying to forgive/forget. Shortly after our son was born, she developed a pretty bad case of postpartum depression. She was off work for 6 weeks because our son was an emergency c-section. I was only granted a week off of work (I am a Graveyard Security Supervisor Sunday - Wednesday 6pm-6am) and most of the time was spent for recovery in the hospital. Long story short, with the new baby and working so much, I was tired. Extremely tired. And I would be sluggish around the house. Not only that, but we weren’t aloud to have sex for a minimum of 6 weeks, and the best way for me to cope with that, is to just ignore the subject completely. Well, this made my wife feel extremely unattractive, and in turn, sought out the attention from another man. Like, a 43 year old dude that lived across the country. It was around three months after my son was born when I started to notice that my wife was acting somewhat cold towards me, always on her phone, never laughed at my jokes, and all in all just not acting like she actually loved me. Well, one day while browsing her Facebook photos (I’m a creep that likes to stair at my pretty wife) I noticed that all her photos had an addition “heart” reaction, but the number was always one off of than what was shown. So, I went onto my old Facebook I had in High School and looked at her photos again, then I saw his name pop up.

I asked my wife about it while I was on lunch one day, and she completely denied it. Then changed the subject by saying that she didn’t feel like she was in love with me anymore. We eventually talked everything out, and were seemingly okay. About a month after that, I had an urge to look through her phone, I don’t know why, I hadn’t thought about it in awhile. But I did. That’s when I found that she was speaking with this guy heavily. I don’t honestly remember the specific messages (because I was swelling with anger at the time.) but they were speaking about sex, her beautiful, how he wants her and vise versa, etc. 

To shorten this long ass post up, her and I did talk everything out, and became okay again. I guess I just need a little more time to completely get over it. It just added onto my now list of insecurities on communication.

TL;DR

I need help with learning to communicate, as well as help starting my journey to end my depression and live life to the fullest. ",0

Today is one of the worst days I've had in a while. 

I feel like a ghost. Feels like I'm floating through the day, and time is only a concept. The hours at work are minutes, but also years. I work to support my existence but I don't even like myself so why bother? I want to just whither away today. Quit and walk out and don't look back -- but that's exactly something I would do, so I won't do it. I just feel so out of control and I'm so angry at everything. 

I wish I knew why I was like this. I just want to be normal. I am so sick and tired of fighting with myself. I feel like I have been on life support and on borrowed time, and eventually I'll have to die. Feeling so bad like this isn't sustainable.

162,"I don't know what happened, last night I was out having dinner and drinks for my sister's birthday and having a fun time.

Now I'm laying in bed in the afternoon on a gorgeous day and all I want is to sleep and bail on the potential plans for later.

I'm so tired of feeling this pain at the drop of a hat. I don't deserve to have all my positive life momentum scrapped every 2 weeks, month, whatever, by something I have no control over and can hardly even describe. I'm terrified at the carelessness I've displayed that's led to my losing friends (and last gf), and how getting older isn't making it any easier to replace the voids that they leave. It's nice to be able to recognize where I've improved and notice within myself when my brain turns on me like this before too long, but I'm powerless to stop it.

167,"I’ve been doing a lot of thinking lately about the world around me and I’ve figured out why I feel so down and drained all of the time, I care too much.

Specifically, I care too much about the future. No matter what I do there are things in life that will always happen. I’m washing dishes right now to get some extra money and it doesn’t matter how fast I work or how ahead I get, I will always leave at 2am, that’s just how things are. When it comes to my friends and the people I talk to everyday, I want to stop them from making bad decisions because I know what happens if they make those decisions. I don’t want them to put their hands on a hot stove and I will do anything to stop them from doing it, but they will still make the wrong decision anyway. 

I understand that some people only learn through pain and failure but I can’t cope with that reality on a larger scale. I’ve made more good decisions then bad decisions in my life and it won’t matter because people I don’t know will inevitably make the same bad decisions that have been made a million times over already.

I have worked my ass off to get to the point where I’m at, I’ll probably graduate from college in 2 years at the age of 21 with a useful degree and a useful certs that should help me find a job, the only problem is the fact that there will likely be a recession when I get out of college because of how the economy is running on overdrive right now. I will have a really hard time finding a job and any sort of stability despite the fact that I have done so much and sacrificed my own happiness so many times over and over again so I can be successful... and it will likely be for naught, and I can’t do anything to stop it, I can’t go any faster and change my fate because it will break me mentally and physically.

168,"I've never been one to take life or the elaborate distractions from our own mortality we call ""society"" too seriously.

Nothing big or fancy like volunteering or voluntourism, just simple things like making someone's day by smiling at them as I pass, keeping the love of my friends and family, you know.

I found a bunch of old posts by friends which are undoubtedly about me and my mopiness and slovenliness and just how much I alienate them, and it's just shattered me on so many levels. I thought I was a good friend. I'm not. I thought I was making headway against my extensive personal problems that drive people away from me. I'm not. I thought that despite my issues, I could make a positive mark on the world, however small. I can't.

I know people will reflexively assume I'm being too harsh on myself, but I'm not. These wouldn't be the first friends I've lost through my own actions. For 20 years I've tried my best to cope with my Asperger's and my ever-growing raft of mental health issues how they affect my social functioning in particular, but it's just not enough.

169,"I've (18F) always been an emotionally complicated child, but my unhappiness worsened  drastically when my mother passed away from cancer around 2 years ago. After that, I lost interest in almost everything and anything. I used to draw, create, bake, write, cook, read, and feel so happy doing all these hobbies, but I can barely pick up a pen now and all I do to pass the time is lie in bed and watch pointless YouTube videos. 

Losing passion has made my university application so much harder. I had been a high achieving student before, but at the end of the year my high school results were nowhere near my expectations throughout school. I did get into a bachelor's though, but then I had no idea what to choose as a major or what I wanted to do in life. 

It doesnt help that my father has very high expectations for me and wants me to become a doctor/lawyer. Throughout the application process he was silent while I needed guidance, but once I randomly chose my subjects and finalised enrollment he ranted and screamed at me for being a disappointment, lazy, for choosing something that wouldn't land me a job. 

I live by myself now for university, and although I have friends from high school, I find it hard to connect with them and it feels as if I am wearing a mask when I'm communicating with them. I feel guilty for not being sincere with them but I know that I shouldnt burden them with my real self. I also have a hard time making friends in my classes, so when classes end I go home and go to sleep. 

I sleep for 10+ hours every night, I'll have 2-4 hour after noon naps as well. On weekends I spend most of the day sleeping or lying in bed watching videos. 

I'm severely depressed because I feel as if I have no direction in life. The course I've chosen doesn't interest me at all, and I'm not doing very well in it. The only thing that probably gives me joy is my long distance boyfriend, but everyone disapproves of the long distance, I barely get to talk to him because he works during the day, and high school relationships tend to end in the first term of uni. I'm scared of losing him. 

I feel so guilty for feeling the way I do. My life isn't particularly difficult, and people are often in much harder positions that I am. I feel like I'm not worthy of being helped because I feel like I'm faking it, but at the same time I desperately don't want to feel like this.

178,"Have you ever moved to a city and thought that all your problems will go away but in turn it just gets worse?

Well I decided to move back to a city where me and my ex were together(she doesn't live there). I had other reasons to go but basically had breakdown within the first week which led my housemates to decide I wasn't a good fit.

Such a fucked up experience but I now know that I can't drink anymore as this breakdown is a massive wake up call. Funny how old memories can rip open old wounds and when you try to contact said person they want nothing to do with you. Understandably. 

I've now decided to move back home and stay with my parents, clear my head and stop drinking completely.  I'm great at putting a straight face and bottling shit up but I'm also not in a good way mentally because of it. 

I just need to move on from that person (been about 1.5 years but we were together for 5), clean my life up and focus on making a better version of myself. 

Still it's hard.

179,"Uh contains spoilers? If you care for that?

Sounds strange, but hear me out. I never got to play Final Fantasy 15 when it released on PS4 because I don’t have one. I thought that I wouldn’t be alive to play it on PC by the time the port would be ready. Why? I went on a Route 66 road trip to have the best time of my life with someone precious to me and to end my life when it was done. 

I went on the trip, had fun, felt a love for life and my friend and couldn’t bear the thought of all of this goodness and my fondness to end. So much dread as I came closer and closer to the end of the trip. But I live and I am glad to.
The PC port came out soon after my return to the land of the living. Oh god I love this game, but oh god I can’t finish it. Because spoilers...

It plays out like a Route 66 road trip and the characters are such close friends... the photos, places, wilderness, highs and lows with friends... just like the trip I experienced- and the end of the trip is... well, Noctis’ fate is too similar to what I had in store for myself, but he had no choice. Agh I’m feeling all the same feelings again, like I’m going to die all over again. Noctis is going to sacrifice himself. I don’t want it to end. 

Honestly I just needed to get this out there. One day I’ll finish the game. I’d like to visit Route 66 again as someone who wants to live to enjoy it even more. ",0
180,"I've dealt with bouts of depression ever since puberty and each time I feel like it can't possibly get any worse, I'm proven wrong. When I think of what my future might look like, I can only worry that my depression will exponentially get worse and worse. 

This last year has gone by in a blur and my only two true friends have become strangers in that time. In 2017 I moved back to the states after living abroad for 2 years and decided it would be so great to move in with my best friend whom I'd missed so much each day and kept in daily contact with. Now we live merely feet apart but barely speak. 

She doesnt know but I've harbored feelings for her for many years now. I never felt that they were strong enough to pursue and always was happy to just enjoy being friends as we always have. (I'm also a girl for context) We have always been these two kinda platonic soul mates and sharing an apartment for the first year was honestly one of the happiest times for me. 

Maybe it was just bad timing but it just happened that as soon as I was dumped by my ex in a really bad break up, she met who would turn out to be her first boyfriend. (We are in our mid twenties) This was when I finally realized maybe my feelings were stronger than I ever wanted to admit. 

I was really torn apart by jealousy. Yes I had dated many people in the time I have known her, maybe that makes me kind of a hypocrite, but it turned out almost impossible to handle the idea of her with somebody. They have been dating almost a year now but I'm still waiting for her to come out of the honeymoon phase. You know the one where you and your new significant other fall off the deep end and forget anyone or anything else exists? 

This is far from my only stressor but it does still sting. I dropped out of trade school and ended up in a hospital because of my mental health. I've been taking shit jobs that I hate ever since just to keep my head above the water and barely get by financially. I have severe misophonia that has completely wrecked my life. Lost my cat recently.. Just a lot of shit has been adding up. 

I'm either at work or I'm in bed with my lights off just looking at my dumb phone. I had to buy a pair of new headphones just so that I could be free from hearing my roommate and her boyfriends laughter because it guts me. I feel like nobody would care if I just disappeared. Some times I think that my roommate wishes I would so she could move her boyfriend in. ",0
181,"I know the question may sound harsh, but I have been living my life long enough to know how shit's gonna turn and go down. It's been so long, and a journey, so boring, you wouldn't believe it.  


Imagine you were good at, let's say, drawing, but regardless of your skill, you'd always mess up your drawing because a drop of water fell on your ink, thus ruining the artwork or the tip of your pen bending, without you even pressuring it, and ruining your drawing... Or playing a game, and losing just because of your luck, just because you have been matched with someone who doesn't care about it as much as you do. Imagine being called to do a job, it's finally something that doesn't involve you going out, you got a project to do, through Photoshop, and you are finally more than glad to work at something you like, but just because you are unlucky, this day out of any, your PC stops working...

&amp;#x200B;

Every single day, every single hour, I'd have a reason to believe that I'm unlucky. From being a simple joke to being a fact people use to describe me. It got to the point where my 'friends' are always cautious of what could happen to me, just because of how many times I got screwed because of my own luck on things so ridiculous that anyone could pass, like the one time we were in some type of abandoned theater, near a forest, and most of my friends passed a wall easily, even girls smaller than me, yet I was the only one who had stitches the day after.  


So when I say that I feel unlucky, I really do, and I got my reasons for it, just avoid the ''oh it's in your mind'', because it's now, you can try and pull any bullshit like that, but it's not gonna fix the way you are treated by life. Anyways, whenever my luck decides to fuck me in a combo (of having a few bad things happen to me in a row), I just wish to get cancer and die. It became a joke within my own head, as I'd be saying it every single day, at points I prayed to get cancer just so I could quit focus from my life, and think about the end...

&amp;#x200B;

I know it may come off as rude, I'd be more than glad to transfer my soul with many of broken poor kids who are currently in hospitals fighting in hope of waking up yet another morning, and I feel bad for them, but so I do for myself. 

&amp;#x200B;

I have less and less will to live, and I do not know what to do. I feel like I'm cursed, I do not believe in God, but there are parts of my past that make me believe that a curse has been put upon me, and it's a reason why shit's always against me.

&amp;#x200B;

I just don't know what else to do, who else to turn to, other than 'some people online', as if I walked up to anyone of my friends and told them I was cursed they'd probably call me out for being crazy (i tried it, trust me, nobody believes you're cursed).

188,"Ive always been a considerably joyful and positive person. Roughly a year ago i slightly liked this girl but never thought of it more than that. However recently i started to like her more and more and wanted to finally ask her out but from fucking nowhere i got hit like a truck by depression. I felt my brain splitting into two parts, one wanted to ask her out, the other didn’t. Both my brains went in a vicious non-ending cycle from wanting to, to not wanting, from wanting to, to not wanting to.

(To simplify things)
Brain wanting to = W
Brain not wanting to = N

At times my W brain felt like it controlled my body and went to ask her and then brain N didn’t want to so both brains just had a stale mate and i just froze there for several minutes, doing nothing. This vicious cycle carried on for a couple of days until i hit my lowest point with depression. I started to have suicidal thoughts but fortunately i was too weak to do it.  I even started fo have dreams about this. Several of them.

I don’t blame her for this she had no knowledge of this.

A week later my friend  called on me like we really regularly do to talk about hip hop but instead i confessed about what happened so he spent 5 and a half hours talking to me how he could help, and he did. 

I just want to say fuck depression

Believe in yourself, stay strong, you can do it. I believe in you",0
189,"I’m a HS student in France. I haven’t been diagnosed with depression because I’ve never been to therapy or whatever you need to go though to get diagnosed. I do have symptoms (according to the list of symptoms) but I do not want to say for sure that I have it. 

 All I do is wake up in the morning, force myself to go to school, come home from school and then be free until I go to sleep at about 3am because that’s usually when I finally do my homework. I have about 8 hours of free time on school days because all I do is stay at home and do nothing but be on my phone, computer or just stare at something and think. I don’t talk to anyone except online « friends » when I feel like it. 

Yes, I’m sleep deprived. I sleep about 4 to 5 hours per night and always do an all nighter from Sunday to Monday because I never do my homework on weekends. 

Talking about weekends, all I do is stay at home all day. I don’t talk to anyone, I just keep myself busy by doing something such as wasting my time on YouTube or reddit. Last time I went out on a weekend was a few weeks ago for a school project. I wake up at 10am, get up at 1pm because and do nothing until 5am the next day when I somehow fall asleep. 

I’m tired of this shit. I have NOTHING to do yet I ALWAYS manage to not do my homework until a few hours before having to go to school. I constantly have suicidal thoughts whether it’s 3am or 3pm. 

My parents don’t seem to fucking care that the only times I go outside it’s to go to school. They never ask « how was your day? » or « why don’t you go out with your friends ». All they do is care about my grades and not my mental health. I do have good grades and I’m not even trying! I’m not smart I just have a good memory and I pay attention in class. Every time I come home all they do is ask « so, did you get any tests back? »  and when I tell them that I got a good grade they tell me « good job! » « you’ll be successful in life! ». 

I feel like my mental health is deteriorating more and more every single day. I feel like it’s just a matter of weeks before I snap and destroy everything around me. No, I’m not okay. I’ve never understood how people could have shitty grades and not come to school but now I think I’m starting to understand. They don’t care about anything and I feel like that’s what is going to happen. I’m going to stop caring about my grades and will always give back blank papers. 

I want everything to stop. Stop. Stop . Stop and fucking stop. I’m constantly tired and feel like sleeping but I don’t because I don’t want tomorrow to come. 


Fucking hell, I think I’m going to go all out. I hate people who get to see therapists. I tell them that  I’m happy for them but in reality I think to myself that they must not be that depressed if they managed to get enough courage to seek therapy. Don’t they feel like they’re fake? I don’t know. All I know is that I don’t want therapy because I’m too afraid of it. 

And NO I can’t talk about this to ANYONE in real life because NO NO NO AND FUCKING NO HOW DO YOU DO IT? HOW DO YOU TALK ABOUT SUCH THINGS TO PEOPLE? 

« talk to someone » I get that you’re trying to help BUT NO ONE FUCKING CARES DO YOU UNDERSTAND? I have been invisible my entire life so why would anyone care. 

I have no one to talk to.

I have never talked about my feelings to anyone IRL.

Every time I talk to somebody online I either get bored of talking to them because I’m an asshole or they get bored because I’m fucking boring. I just don’t have the motivation to do anything anymore. I have exams next week and I don’t think I’m going to study for them. 

A lot of things probably don’t make sense but I don’t care, I wrote whatever was going though my mind.

I don’t know what I’m expecting from all this but if you read everything then I don’t know what to say, just keep scrolling I guess?

I've seen a social worker and counsellor which were covered by my provincial health insurance plan but they felt more like a friend to talk to which didn't help. I've also paid out of pocket to see a psychotherapist twice which was only half the price of a Psychologist but his advice was only breathing and tapping techniques which felt useless to me plus we didn't connect together and I'm embarrassed that I opened up to him. I've never been motivated enough to write down my feelings in a journal like most counsellors recommend.  

I've never been formally diagnosed with anything as I don't know where to get that but I'm quite certain for the majority of my life I suffered from depression, anxiety and am quite possibly bipolar. My family doctor put me on sertraline and Abilify which worked but the weight gain and muscle spasms were too much to handle.

My best friend invited me to come to Colorado to her friends wedding that she was officiating. When we got there, that is when I met Ken (Ken is a F2M trans person). Imagine a park ranger persona type of person, tattoos, big smile on his face while having his hands on his hips and looking up at the sky. That's Ken. We hung out together a lot. It was very obvious that we had interest. One night, we laid on the mountain top staring at the sky, talking, laughing.  He then told me passively about his gf, I was kinda bummed out, but enjoyed the friendship. The next night, he asked me what I thought about polygamy. That was unexpected, and I never thought about it. I told him just that, nodded his head and started talking about an old crush of his who broke his heart, who he didn't trust anymore (Sara). I listened to it all in stride, having a fun time. Also to note, Ken has an extremely mild case of Aspbergers.

After all that, the next few months were a lot of texting/calling. Casual conversation. At that time I wasnt sure what kind of relationship he had with Angela (gf). Was it open? I admitted to him one night that I had a crush on him, he reciprocated and that changed things. I asked about Angela and he told me he was looking to end things with her, but didnt want to hurt her feelings. I told him not to string her along, and he agreed. He said that she agreed to his need for 'free love'. The next month I came to visit him and have fun. Angela was there 90% of the time, she came over and he would 100% ignore me and get all cuddly and schmoozy with her. I felt like I was entertaining myself, or in a uncomfortable situation. I mentioned it to him cause he seemed oblivious, and he told me she wanted to be there so he had to prove all was well to keep her happy. The one day she didnt come over we slept in bed and had sex. He had said they had an open thing, so I thought it was ok. I mentioned the fact I liked the idea of a relationship with him &amp; he acted like he didnt want to make commitments. Remember, 'free-love' guy. The next night we (Angela too) went to a gay club and he was allll over this guy there. He was talking to me about him like ""mmm I bet he is fun ;) I got his number"". That night Angela spent the night with him and I slept on the air mattress.  The next night, I got a call from my mom saying that my dad unexpectedly took a turn for the worst and was intubated. I went back home the next day to find he was dying. He died later that night of severe sepsis with all us around him. The hardest moment of my life.

The next few months, me and Ken continued to talk. Him and Angela's relationship was still there, and he just kept saying he was intending on ending it. Then he said he would wait till he got back from Cali (a trip to visit family/Ken to meet family). He procrastinated cause he didnt want to hurt her feelings/deal with it. After the trip, he messaged telling me he did it. I was glad and glad she wasn't being strung along.

After a few more visits, we talked vaguely about me moving down. At this point Ken was in a ""can't we just be"" instead of committing zone. I wanted more but tried to open up to his thoughts. I didn't want to push it. Our interest in each other grew. I was willing to see what happens. About 2 days before I moved down Ken told me casually and with happy inflection that he got the random guy that he hit on/wanted to sleep with at the bar to move in (Matt). I hung up lol. He called back like ""did I say something wrong?""  I told him I wasnt going to be in that uncomfortable situation again and he reassured me it is just for extra $ and he needed a place to stay. He had no interest. I accepted that. I moved down. Matt and Ken didn't do anything, they clashed and Ken couldnt stand him after a few months. Ken and I became emotionally attached. He told me he was in love with me. He often told me at random, or if I asked...that I am enough for him and he doesnt want anyone else. For the entire relationship, he instilled that. A year later he asked me to marry him...and for someone who was so afraid of commitment, that stunned me. Around this time, my health anxiety came about. I am a severe hypochondriac with PTSD like issues from excessive, past trauma. I am currently being evaluated, but multiple terms have been discussed. I have had this issue since I was 5 and it fluctuates or disappears. My folks instilled that going to a therapist would land me in a padded room. They felt it was my duty to manage my own mind. So I always severely avoided therapists. I told ken openly that I was a hypochondriac with severe anxiety and he was understanding. At this point, I hadn't had that side of me appear yet. 

A month later, I was on Kens laptop. I ended up getting on the internet and went to my FB. He was still logged in and I kinda pondered for a min. I saw he messaged Sara and it was suggestive. Like, talking bout how good she was ""with your fingers ;)"" (they had a minor sexual encounter previously) and other flirty things. The problem was this was RECENT. She was discussing wanting to take him to Hawaii. That night, I showed him that I saw his msgs, and I was pissed. He wanted to sit with me and run through the convo to clarify it meant nothing. And that they always talked like that jokingly. That he thought about Hawaii, but wouldn't do anything. That he just wanted a free vacation cause he felt he deserved it after hotwiring her 3000$ 3 years before to get her teeth fixed. The whole thing smelled of BS. I then did the worst thing out of BLINDING ANGER. The worst thing I have ever done. I made a faux Sara acct spiting me in order to get Ken to stop talking to her. I was a total shit for it. The whole thing did go through and he deleted her. I didn't feel good about it, why would I? I knew I had to admit to Ken what I did, no matter the cost. I knew the consequences; leaving me, him talking to her again, kicked out, I don't know..but I was prepared for whatever, so I told him. His reaction was, like it wasnt a big deal. He wasn't upset. He told me he didnt have any interest in talking to her anyways so he was going to just keep it that way. 

Through the arguments over the years, seldomly I would fly off about her if we were talking about her or something relevant. Like the term ""your precious fucking Sara"" came out of my mouth a handful of times. He'd just get into IDC mode or be hurt that I would doubt his feelings/what he says. 
   
A few months later my health anxiety got bad. It coincided with the wedding stress. My hobbies all stopped. All that existed was my fears. For the next few years the anxiety would came &amp; went. I would be so out of it, that my surroundings were cloudy. Not paying attention. I would ask irrational health fears to ken which, initially he was fine with, but then it was a regular thing and he couldn't deal with it.  His personal issues surrounding it werent getting addressed from me cause of my mindset.  If he were to talk about how he feels and I was focused and there, it was often he would say something painful about me or us that I didnt know how to respond other than shock or sadness when he was looking for acceptance, so he thought I wasnt prioritizing his feelings. He pushed me many times to go to a psychologist, and I would always put it off, try and get better on my own, fail, and repeat. This is something that fluctuated. I kept meaning to go, but I just got clammy and scared over it. I tried so hard to keep it in myself and not burden him cause...I didn't want to burden him with it anymore. Hes my husband, not a crutch. Throughout the on/off bouts..our lives were, good. We both worked at ACE together, a house, a great routine..and we genuinely enjoyed our time together. 5 out of 7 days Ken would wake up, wake me up with a kiss on the cheek and a snuggle in bed, get in the car, go get breakfast sandwiches, drive to work, go to a restaurant after work, try and beat eachothers score in Cribbage, go home and watch Netflix in bed, sex, and cuddle to sleep. 5 nights a week for like...2 yrs. 
Then, his folks went on a road trip to Boise and said they were looking to retire there. They wanted to fly Ken out to look at homes with them cause they wanted us to move up there too. I was unsure about this, I was comfortable, but it was an opportunity to go somewhere better and with more options. They got the house and we all drove to Idaho. I had severe suppressed/released anxiety from around February till now. A huge one. And Ken was at the end of his rope with it. We still did all the amazing cuddly, fun things together..enjoying each other but if my health anxiety seeped through, it ruined it. My sleeping habits also got severely effected, and just my general well being.  Through this all, he always maintained that  he just can't deal with my anxiety, he wants me to get help, lost hope, loves me, wants to be together, would never let me go, never forever. This was literally 2 weeks ago that he told me all that. In the arguments he would accuse me of being a liar, untrustworthy, selfish, childish, etc. 

This last Tuesday was The big Kahuna.  Ken seemed odd. I asked him on Monday in bed what was up, if he was distancing himself from me and he took a second and told me everything was good.  On Tuesday we went to eat dinner at some fancy restaurant, cracked some jokes, I asked him if he wanted to go do the $5 Tuesdays and he was all for that. Like totally excited, holding my hand, you know all the gooey lovely stuff. Which is normal and constant for us. I came home and gave him a kiss on the forehead as he was texting his best friend April and the text looked like otd be something bad about me, but when I politely asked, he bold face lied to me saying it was about something else, I could tell he was lying and asked if it were really about me and he said ""well, yes"", ""well then why did you lie to me?"", ""cause I didn't want to start a fight before the movie"" and then I got angry, not cause he was talking to April about me (which isn't a state fucking secret, I really don't care) it was him lying to me. I blew up over it. He went to the movie alone, and at the end of it texted me with this

""You've never believed how I felt about you. And you're right, I didn't know how to answer your question last night..thats why it took some time to think about. I am going to stop pretending that everything is okay cause it isn't. I don't want to sleep with you anymore, I don't want to do things with you anymore, you're not the person I want to be with. I gave you many chances to get help, I am done and I would like you to go""

You can probably imagine how I reacted, bawled like a baby. I called him making a complete ass out of myself saying he couldn't have meant that, he loves me, Im sorry, I will go to a therapist, etc...and he just looked at me like ..get a hold of yourself. He has never said that or ever indicated EVER that he wanted that. Everytime, even weeks before he said he would never leave me, loves me too much, etc. At home i said 
""Please, i am sorry...""
""it's too late""
""do you really want me to leave?""
""YES""
""for good?""
""for now""
 ""I will get help for real I will!""
 ""What, you think going to a therapist will make me suddenly have feelings for you again?"" 
""you don't love m---??""
""I am going to bed""
""but.."" 
""BED. I have to be up at 6"" (shuts door). not a tear, not a care, not even anger...just a fed up-ness.

 Once I got a hold of myself I wrote him an extensive text stating how I need help, and I can't pretend any longer that I can deal with it on my own, and how I can't use him as a crutch and that I don't blame him for being fed up with it, that it sucks I needed a massive push but I am going to do it and hope it betters myself as a standalone human cause I can't affect people like this. I wrote him basically that (summarized). He didn't respond Wednesday, I contacted every single therapist in town to get an appt in asap...and got one for Friday. My sister was resoundingly proud, (crying actually) that I was really going to do this. She'd only been pushing me for 20 years lol. I did everything I could to improve at the quality of my day to help clear my head. I cleaned the kitchen, bathroom, myself, got a decent sleep schedule, made dinner. Ken came home, and seemed...jubilant...about his day (which is normal. His #1 priority is the quality of his day/job/hobby. He wont let ANYTHING disturb that...hence why he wants to get rid of me and went to bed mid breaking my heart. That's very normal for him. One of his biggest complaints about me in our relationship is me keeping him up past his bedtime. Like he said I dont care about his well being cause I was in a talking mood at the wrong time. Or I would be on my phone in bed and it would keep him up so I'd put the covers over me so it didn't bother/he wouldnt see. He considered that sneaky lying.) So yeah, jubilant just with his day. The bizarre thing was him being sporadically extremely nice/normal to me but also very distant. I got 1 text from him ""I am glad you go an appointment, We'll see how it goes but I want space at home"". I respected that, and didn't bother him. And went on faith.

Thursday I cooked, made cupcakes, got groceries, still giving him his space. At this point in my head I was done with the 'pining' 'mindset and just...tried to find the positive in that, everything happens for a reason, and maybe my stubborn ass needed a slap to put me in the place I really need to be. So in a small way, I looked forward to my appt. I talked to my sister and she understood his need to distance himself, to say ""you know what? I am fed up, I can't do this any more unless you get help. I'm done"" but made it clear that if I follow through and really give it my 1200% and he still wants out then that is really shitty and says very little about the vows he made. I talked to April that night who basically was like ""I think he is done. I was really excited you were finally getting that help, I just don't think that hope was shared"". 

The next day was my appt and fuuuck. Sitting across from a woman staring at you, talking about your entire life story in order to be assessed was hard. I picked my fingers till they bled I was so nervous. She was worried about PTSD, and it manifesting in some tangible way. She could tell I was extremely nervous and tried to calm me down. Afterward though, it felt...okay. like, I did it, and I will continue to. When I got home, Ken was there. He started talking to me and I took that as it was safe to talk too. He was happy I went, proud maybe..but wary. He was still in that 'place' but he was really seeing I am ding my part, and will continue to. He told me spontaneously then that he started talking to Sara again. My brain went blank. like the blankest stare into nothingness. Normally, I would be upset, but I was composed (but dying on the inside). He literally handed me his phone and said I am more than welcome to look at the texts. I was not ready for it. I just got Ken to talk and then this sunk me back to an even worse place. I read the texts and I literally could not believe my eyes.

""Why did you add me again?""

""I wanted to apologize for unfriending you years ago""

(proceeded to tell the literal entire story of when I made that fake account years ago, and how fucked up it was...the one I admitted to and he didn't even seem bothered by/said he didn't have any desire to talk to her anyway. Also told her I 'snooped' on their messages that time and it was totally ""fucked up""....the messages he literally encouraged i read through with and was understanding about and told me I was more than welcome to look at any of his stuff to prove he has nothing to hide )

""Omg! Why would you marry someone like that?""

""I contemplated calling it off when I found out, but I had too much money on the venue. I wanted to add you back all these years but I didnt want to make her mad, and I didnt know if it would really be you I was talking to you this time. I don't care what she sees anymore (see what?).""

""Don't worry, she's out of my life for good, how are you?""

(and literally the following is just a plethora of giddy 6-7am conversations with him talking about how beautiful the sunrise is there, etc and many phone calls.)

I was FUMED. I walked out to have a cigarette to try and compose myself. I asked him to come out and talk with me.
Me:""that was some painful things you said""
Him: ""yeah, I knew it would be tough for you to hear""
Me: ""Do you like her?""
Him: ""no, I messaged her to apologize and to have a friend back"" 
Me: ""you told her you contemplated marrying me then?"" 
Him: ""Yeah, I did..that was such a big lie""
Me: ""it was, and I told you flat out I did it and you let it go"" 
Him: ""well thats cause I already knew and had time to process. I actually found it on your computer."" 
Me: "" What? You didn't tell me that""
Him: *shrugs*
Me: Was it true about why you continued with the wedding?""
Him: ""I did it cause I love you""
Me: ""No, you said to her you stuck with it cause of the down payment on the venue"" Him: ""Stop. Why do you do that? Why do you always jump to conclusions and not take what I say? I love you and thats why I did it. The $ was secondary."" 
Me: ""Do you really want a divorce?""
Him: ""I thought about it the other day yeah.""
Me: ""But, doesnt that even bother you?"" 
Him: ""you arent allowed to ask me about my emotions yet till you earn it"" 
Me: ""okay..I just don't understand why that extreme. We love each other.""
Him: ""You can be divorced and still in love. Lots of divorced people are in love...""
Him: ""I want to be with you. I love you. I never wanted it to get to this point, to contemplate leaving you, but I don't want to live like this (cries) with you refusing help."" 
Me: ""I am going to someone, I am really on this. This is it""
Him: ""I want to see you get help and I want you back""

 Later I said, verbatim ""I am going to try and be okay with the Sara thing. It hurts, i hate it, I don't understand it, but I am trying here"" and he said ""you arent going to dictate who I want to talk to or who I want to be friends with. Its none of your business"". He has made it very clear that I have to earn him back and that if I am not cool with something, tough shit. 

 How could he say all those things? I have him back, kinda. Now he is in a...'it is going to take some time to earn my trust back but I want the anxietyless you cause I love you and I am proud you will get help' mode. I am going to continue to do my part, to do me, to fix myself...but like...I feel just...I don't even know. The Sara thing is extremely uncomfortable...and I don't know if that is something that I am overreacting over or he really is not doing right. If it is wrong what can I even say about it?

Also, now Ken is trying to do stuff with me. Yesterday we went to a BBQ pit, he was laughing at my jokes, if he saw i had goosebumps he's stroke his finger on my arm and giggle or offer his coat. But at night he still went to sleep in the other room, I asked him if he was sleeping in there again and he did the whole...breathe in and 'what did I say before' look. ""I told you yesterday until you get back to your sleep schedule right I sleep alone"" then hugged me and kissed me on the forehead. He won't kiss me on the lips yet. He woke me up this morning stroking my back and kissing my head like ""you gonna get up and we can do stuff? Do you want to go shopping?"" I of course got up despite crummy sleep, pretending I am totally awake and ready. Like 5 min ago i noticed he wasn't wearing his ring. I asked where it was and he said he had put it away. I wanted to ask more about, and that is typical of me to persist a subject I am not getting a clear answer to or I want more answers to...but if I did he would give me that look again and start getting frustrated that I am doing that thing where I keep asking when he is trying to have a good day with me. And now I have these urges to look at his phone to see if he is still talking to Sara and what about now.

207,"My depression has only declined further and further since I was 11. I've always been a piss-poor student because I've never had any drive or motivation. There's nothing in life that really brings me joy that I can look forward to. In fact, I can't even remember the last time I felt genuine shock or excitement or disgust or really any emotion apart from emptiness or sadness. I feel like a robot whose unable to experience human emotion. Every single night I ask myself why I choose to stay here and the only answer I can come up with is that I'm too scared to die. I've known for a long time that suicide is going to be my way out, the only uncertainty is the ""when am I going to be ready to face it?"".

I'm also so incredibly lonely. These days I'm utterly haunted by thoughts of my former S/O who felt like the only family I ever had. It's been almost exactly a year since she left. I was already in hell before it happened — I can't juggle my general apathy and lost love at the same time. Maybe my death would act as some form of redemption? Maybe she'll sympathize with me then? Maybe I'll cross her mind again? It's certainly a motivator.

I fully realize that I'll probably find another lover to feel the same way about in time. I really don't know if my depression is going to get better, I can't say. I know that neither is worth wading and waiting through the pain I'm experiencing now. I can't take it anymore. This is the breaking point. I've had enough. Nothing more is worth it.

I got a scholarship to France and didn't return, I applied for asylum for how they treated me because of me being gay. When I almost got my refugee status, my parents guilt me to return back, effectively killed my chance to build my own life.

They made a proposition that they'll pay for my tuition to study abroad for a chance of getting PR in Canada. It's been a year and a half since I've returned. I've kept my end of the deal, while my parents kept postponing their end. Now they're ""suggesting"" that I get a job here while waiting for their end of the deal, which I've stated from the beginning I won't do and they've agreed on. 

I spend my day in my room 24/7, I tried to focus on art to keep me from going insane at this point. I don't have any friend here, but I try to keep my connection with my online friends. 

I honestly feel really bad for not helping them financially, they're on a mid to lower class family. Sometimes I regret leaving France. Although I struggle to live there with a bare minimum amount of money, I have my cat, and my friends, and I can be myself, and I don't feel guilty for leeching at my parents.

I know I sound like a shit child. I hate myself for trying to keep my integrity. But I really hate living here, and the idea of working here, and they've agreed on the term of me returning back. I feel like it's best for me to leave asap or just die asap. I'm just too tired living like this. I'm too tired hating myself and living like this. I just wanna disappear and stop existing.

Also sorry this is a long one.

I (22M) just realised how badly I treated my SO three years ago.

This happened when I was 19. I was going out with this amazing girl, my first GF, and everything was going great. I had just started uni, got myself a part time job and met the first girl I truly enjoyed spending time with. 
However, as time went on, about 4 months into the relationship, I started to lose interest in everything found myself not wanting to do anything. I even struggled to get an erection with my GF. I was feeling constantly exhausted and just found myself not wanting to get out of bed. Just felt completely disconnected with everyone and everything. Now after all this happening to me everything coming together somehow depression never even crossed my mind.
But I started pushing her away without even realising what I was doing. At times ghosting her for a week at a time, it wasnt just her it was all of my friends basically became a shut in. I was stressing out about uni because I wasnt doing well. I had realised I was spending more time on my job and GF than I was on my studying. I started getting filled with anxiety about fucking up uni and losing all my hard work I had put in to get where I was. Without realising it I pushed her away and we had, what should have been, a small argument about how I had been getting more distant. Instead I took offence to it because I thought she was being unreasonable, at the time. Right in the middle of my exam period to be pulling me up for being more distant when I was stressed beyond belief. I saw this fight as an escape route. But I never actually properly broke up with her. Turned out it would be the last time I would ever see her. We ended up ghosting each other, I am 99.9% sure she was waiting on me to text or call her, making me the biggest POS in existence as well creating, at this point in my life, my worst decision I have ever made. 

But that wasnt the real me! I am kind caring, and the last thing I would ever want to do is hurt someone that cares about me! I was just mentally fucked up and didnt even realise it.

For the next 2 years after all of this happened I did uni work, which stressed me out, I played competitive video games which stressed me out, and I went out every week at least twice which made me tired. So I wasnt helping myself and being unhealthy but I just wanted to be constantly busy so I wasnt left with my thoughts.
At this point I was at my lowest constantly considering of killing myself failing at uni, alone with a good group of friends and my family. Not wanting to get out of bed and just completely done with life. I was still in complete denial that I had depression. How can I have depression? I have great friends and family and I'm on the course I've always wanted to do, I get food on my plate every day, I can get clean water whenever I want. What right do i have to be depressed?
However, one day when I was having one of the worst panic attacks I've ever had. Worrying about all the uni work, my dissertation, my exams, my assignments, my groups projects. I didnt touch my phone and ghosted everyone. Much like I had done 2 years prior, which for the first time ever triggered a thought within me that something wasnt right.
I was just watching shite on YouTube, as per usual, and I saw this video with stormzy talking about how depression had gotten to him it suddenly hit me like a truck going at the speed of light, if that guy can get depressed. Someone who reached peak of music, got awards and tonnes of money is depressed, then I sure as hell can get depressed.

I suddenly realised that thinking of getting run over by a bus just so I wouldn't have to go to uni wasnt normal thinking. Thinking aww maybe if I just let it run over my legs just so I couldn't walk would mean I wouldn't have to go to uni. I realised too late in fact it was uni that had been my source of depression. Well fucking duh!

I however, stupidly, was very embarrassed that I had depression so I hid it. ""I ain't no fuckin pussy"" I remember thinking to myself. So I didnt tell anyone. Kept going on about it my final year of uni I completely fucked it up beyond belief nailed my dissertation but failed every single class that year.

I went out after my last exam, knowing I had fucked all of my exams, with my uni pals. I was in such a bad state of mind I wanted to go out get blind drunk and take every drug under the sun just so I could feel something positive for once. Looking back I think I was hoping the drugs would kill me, but thankfully they didnt. I woke up in some girls flat no idea where the actual fuck I was with her trying to pull my trousers and boxers down. I just went with it because well tbh I had no fucking clue what was going on. I kept blacking out throughout it. Turns out I had taken way too many drugs and my dick was smaller than a raisin, could have also been the depression but feel drugs were more likely for this case. She got offended that I wasnt turned on by her and she kicked me out her flat into the cold night. I would like to add that this was a rare occurrence because I hadn't been interested in anyobe sexually, other than porn, since things ended with my GF.
I Luckily still had my phone and called one of my best pals who turns out lived right around the corner from this girls flat. He rescued me and I stayed at his.

I then realised that I should get help. I told my mum and dad that I thought I was depressed and that I had been feeling suicidal and wanting to harm myself. I was so scared to tell them, now I cant think why I was scared but I was shaking out of fear. They were immediately so supportive and have been helping me through it ever since. Dad has bupa family cover so I was able to see a physiologist and I have been seeing him ever since. I now have a full time job in engineering, the field I wanted to go into.

I was starting to get back on my feet, finding interests again, wanting to learn new stuff again, just wanting to do everything! It was amazing it was like I had these weights on my shoulders just lifted off and I had been wearing dreary filter glasses all that time.

So I decided that I would be interested in dating again. Immediately, met this girl we got on really well. Cutting a long story short she broke up with me in a pretty shitty way, not nearly as bad as mine. Which then brings us to today I have just come to the realisation of how much of a piece of shit I was to my first GF, and frankly embarrassed how long it took me to realise it.

But as I said earlier I haven't been myself for 3 years without even realising it.

So here comes the questions. I wanted to reach out to her and apologise and ask to meet up so I can explain myself. But then I think I'm being selfish because she has spent the past 3 years moving on probably and I dont want to dig up her past like that. Considering how unbelievably shitty I was to her, and just heap it all back onto her. But then I feel like she deserves closure, but then is it really me that's looking for closure? Once again bringing back the am I being selfish? Is even getting back together with her a possible outcome? Would she even want me back after what I did to her? How could she trust me?

I guess what I am trying to ask is what is best for her? Not to contact her or to contact her?

Tldr: was really shitty to my GF, turned out it was because I was depressed and I'm filled with guilt and regret with how it ended. Should I try reach out and apologise?",0

As a child, I was sexually abused, multiple times. I was also physically and mentally abused by my mother.

As a teen, I was bullied, by both “friends” and strangers. As a result, I started isolating myself. Became very antisocial, and started hating my life.

Now I’m in my 20s, with many psychological problems, caused by my tough childhood and challenging teen years. 

So I guess I’ll continue living like a loser for the rest of my life.

227,"I made a half-assed attempt at suicide about three years ago, tried to hang myself while I was super drunk (had a drinking problem) but the knot kept slipping from the place I was trying to hang myself from. Since then I think I have tried maybe once more, with an HDMI cable, but couldn't find really any good anchoring point in my bedroom and was freaking out because of sentimental/relationship issues though I don't consider it an attempt since no significant choking happened.

I remember when I looked up suicide methods, when I thought about suicide, I always cried, got desperate and felt really bad.

Now, after period of relative lack of suicidal thoughts, I'm thinking about it a lot. But there's something different this time.

I don't feel sad while doing so, I'm not worried about what other people will think or do. My only interest is doing it fairly painlessly and without leaving a gruesome or scarring scene. My mother made a suicidal gesture with benzodiazepines and I found her after many hours on the bathroom floor, struggling for air, covered in puke and black blood; the anxiety, the smell, the sight, caused me PTSD. I don't want anyone to experience that so I'm studying a way to not traumatize too much anyone and to leave my body in a decent and not embarrassing way.

There's something eerie about the lack of fear and sadness in my thoughts when I think about and seek ways to suicide. I can't describe it, it's unnatural. When I think of my future I can see none. I just can't.

I only need to find the willpower to do it, but I'm not really scared anymore.",0

229,"So this is my first post on reddit and I thought I'm just going to tell you something about my ""depression"" or whatever you want to call it.

&amp;#x200B;

First of all I'm a 16 year old boy I'm a little bit sporty, kinda have some humour, so my appearence isn't that bad. I guess. But thats not really important right now.

So it all started last year during summer break where I started working at a job and going to school two days a week. Probably sounds strange to most of you but at my place this is like going to highschool or whatever. Because almost all my friends work at different locations and school isn't at the same place anymore I started to lose contact to them and I stopped meeting them. There even was a time I was kinda ""afraid"" to ask them to do anything because they became almost strangers for me. Luckily that stopped pretty fast and I really don't know why I had this feeling about it. At this point of time life was already going up and down for me I had days which were everything was alright and I had days where I just cried myself to sleep, even tho I never really cried I just felt really bad if thats understandable? The problem here was that I never really knew why I was so depressed, I mean yeah it wasn't really nice to lose friendships and thinking back always hurt a little but it wasn't really the thing that was bothering me so much. 

At that time I also found out about a girl that went to the same place as I did to work. I really found her cute and I think I had a huge crush on her, even if I never talked to her nor chatted with her. So I found out her name and stuff and started to write her on snapchat. Yeah ik that sounds weird. She was never really giving me attention so I stopped messaging her because I felt like I was annoying her. Since I never really had a girlfriend I couldn't talk to her because I was scared like sh\*t. Some days later one of my ""co-workers"", It's not really a co-worker but I'll just call it like that, started talking about her and how they are going to lunch together. I was thinking they knew eachother like as friends and stuff so I didn't really care to much about that. Later he also said that she's cute and all and that was the moment I realised they were more than that. ""And my worst fears became true"", or something like this xD. Yeah so they became a couple and it was like someone rammed a knife in my heart while piercing me with a sword. Jokes aside, but it really hurt me to see them like this. I mean I was kinda happy for them but I also was disgusted by seeing them kissing. So from time to time I lost all my interest in her and just felt as cold as I am while seeing a stranger while I'm seeing her. 

Thats the time where I started watching anime, I did watch some before but just from time to time and no drama or anything, just the basic animes. Somehow these series made me feel happier and gave me a feeling that I was not alone. I started watching romance animes and thats where everything started getting worse and worse. I felt jealous of the guys in the shows and wished I could be them. Who tf is jealous of 2D imaginary people, Right?, well, me. I also started to lose all my interests in real Girls. I dont find them attractive anymore. I know anime is imaginary and its f\*cking weird to find anime girls more attractive than real women. I'm kind of ashamed by myself that I turned into this. 

I never really knew why I was or am so depressed even if it was so obvious. I always was alone since summer, I never really talked to a friend and I never did, even tho I was having a hard time. I just have no one to really talk to when I have real problems, no one cares about how I'm feeling. So maybe that sound selfish even if I have friends, they are just not near to me. I think thats why I've gotten like this.

&amp;#x200B;

So here I'm sitting, a 16 year old boy that only likes imaginary girls, never really loved anyone and doesn't have close friends.

  
I don't know what I'm trying to achieve with this post but it just felt good to let it all out. Maybe my story sounds weird and f\*cked up to people. I really don't know.

232,"So, yesterday I went on a trip down to London with two close friends of mine, one of which I have developped feelings for.

The day started out really well, until over the course of the trip the guy I like revealled he had a crush on our other friend and spent the day flirting and the two of them being all cute together. The other person knows I have a crush on this guy and asked him if maybe he could not do it because it wasn't fair on me, which was absolutely lovely of him, but oh my god, does it hurt to see the person I like crush on somebody else.

It's the story of my friggin' life. I wish I knew how to just turn off these feelings, because the pair of them are such friends to me, but I don't think I could have it in my face all the time. 

I have a habit of withdrawing myself from the world when shit gets difficult, and this (plus a number of other issues) has me wanting to do so again. 

Does anybody have any hints on how to either get over someone or just turn off feelings of this sort, or even just on how to manage?",0

But once I'm dead all of that guilt will be gone anyways.

236,So recently I've been balancing between killing myself and living with the hate i have for myself.  This isn't something new in fact I'm quite familiar with it since I've felt this way since I was twelve years old but thats a completely different chapter of my life for another day.  But the sad thing is recently I came to a new school after dropping out at my old one and at this new one i made a new friend.  She understood me more than I did even though that sounds extremely corny.  I've tried to off myself eight times now and each time i failed the last time was a week ago and the reason I didn't was her.  because of a promise i made her (I wouldn't kill myself) i survived.  And this made me realize that as long as i was around her or thought of her i felt better and not like a nutjob.  About two days after i told her i nearly killed myself and she look genuinely disappointed at me and for the first time in a while i felt bad not for thinking that way but bad she was disappointed in me.  It was also in this day i found a note i wrote to her.  The note stated i love you. Just that only that and i realized that i had given that up to help her from harming herself as well (this was when she made me promise).  And me being the idiot i am i decided to say i love her in person.  Here i am surprised she's dating a guy i know.  The second i found out it was too late the damage was done and i couldn't take a thing i said back (nor did i want to) this was thursday.  And all i can think about is how her smile and the way she laughed as well as the way she looked when i told her i tried to kill myself were once things that gave me hope and made me reconsider who i am and what i will be now made me depressed beyond belief and crushed me because i can't be her friend about me because anytime i see her or walk by her a part of me dies inside and i hate myself even more than before.  And the only way i can think of dealing with it is humor but i can't find any in the pit I've fallen into and all i can think of is what I'll say to her when i see her because i can't just leave it at this and i can't just kill myself without saying goodbye.  I'm not asking for advice or pity all i want is to know someone is listening to my thoughts and problems,0
237,"what can i say? the title is a pretty good way to sum up my life. i have several different hobbies, bu there's a twist. instead of being average at all of them, i fucking suck at every single one of them. i got nothing that i'm proficient with whatsoever. i look around to all of my friends with similar hobbies and they're all much better than me regardless of how long they've been doing it for. one thing i used to love to do is draw characters and attempt to express myself through it. none of the finished drawings ever looked good though. because that would mean that i'm good at one thing instead of terrible at everything. video games, is another hobby that i love. it helps me escape, lets me be something i'm not. bottom of the scoreboard everytime, no matter what. no matter how long i've been playing i always get my ass whooped by fellow players because i fucking suck at that as well. i love to listen to music, even attempted to write a few songs of my own. got no sense of rhythm, can't rhyme worth a dam, and i'm tone def and so on.

&amp;#x200B;

it's frustrating, at this point i got nothing i'm good at. constant and consistent failure, guess i could be ironically good at failing. infact, just last week i tried drawing again, i pulled up a reference on my phone and put it on the table. and a friend of mine who's a year younger than me, and has never made a picture in her life, started drawing the reference. as i was drawing the character, i look over to my friends work and she's almost done with the legs near flawlessly close to the reference. looking back over i'm still only working on the head and even that looked like shit. and now look where i am, on a site where people come for assurance because it's easier to put our thought onto open space rather than talking with anyone. continuing to be the selfish cunt i am looking for attention just so that i can get a five second gap of peace before i go back to feeling numbness once more. i'm too chicken shit to improve on anything because my dumbass wants to improve quickly even though i know it takes time. i can never handle confrontation because i stutter like a fucking blockhead and can't remember anything in the moment. too stupid to graduate school properly, (i had to cheat).

&amp;#x200B;

and am i willing to talk about this with my friends and family? no, because then i would be super fucking self centered and taking up the spotlight with my dumbass unimportant problems when there are far greater problems. but i still get sad and isolate myself then get sad because people don't wanna talk with me as much anymore. because if i were smart, i would be able to tell who is and isn't a real friend. but nope, i'm so fucking desperate i'll befriend anyone who's willing to talk with me because i'm so scared of being alone i would rather be betrayed than be alone by myself. hell, i can't even keep a consistent schedule. me and my friends play dnd and i'm the dungeon master, but can i keep a consistent schedule for everyone to show up at? no, because my dumbass didn't write enough material for them to go through and i have to delay if not cancel the session all because my lazy ass couldn't bother to write some dialog, enemies and plot. 

&amp;#x200B;

so now i am going to post this into this subreddit where no one will see it because it'll be at the bottom of the fucking hunormos list. so no one will see this, read it, or comment on it. and hell, that's probably what i get for being so god damn selfish going so far as to get sympathy from strangers because i'm too much of a coward to come clean. and trust me, i've had suicidal thoughts. really close to the edge, but the only thing stopping me is because i know i would fuck it up and survive so i just don't bother because i don't wanna bother the paramedics when they could save someone who'll actually contribute to society rather than a pathetic waste of space that would be more useful as compost rather than anything else.",0

Even if most days are bad, there are still good people in the world. I want to take my depression on not in a fight, but in acceptance of it being part of me. And accepting that 98% of my days are going to be lonely. That I am not going to have anyone. That I have myself to make myself happy.

The toughest part is doing what makes me happy in the longrun vs doing what makes me happy now.

But I know the moment I step out of the ""escape"" of video games, I' m back into the real world. My place is messy as fuck. I have a laundry list of todos. I have tickets I need to pay.

Nipsey Hussle just died. Lebron went on an interview and said that the men who killed him were from the same city he's from. They're hate him for his success because they feel like he ""left them behind"" when in reality Nipsey never owed them anything because he DID do his part. He did give back SO much to his community.

&amp;#x200B;

The reason why he mentioned this was because between Nispey and Lebron vs the people in their community who feel ""left behind""... there sits a difference in motivation. Lebron, Nipsey... although very different people were / are performers in their own field. They have an unstoppable force of motivation that comes from inside of them. They are/were so heavily involved in their communities to make them better. It's a beautiful thing.

250,"   I’ve had mental issues as far back as i can remember, but up until 2015 it wasn’t as bad as it’s grown to be today. I don’t know exactly what i need, help? Someone who understands a situation like mine? Or if it’s best to just keep on holding it in until i explode somewhere away from loved ones... I’ve been institutionalized multiple times as a child (8 years old-12) off and on, short term and long term. The reasoning for that was because i was out of control as a kid. I know i was miserable to be around, but it was never for a “gain.”


   What i mean by this is that normally a kid who was spoiled or so would most likely break stuff or be disrespectful in hopes to be granted certain things or permissions. That wasn’t me, i was born into a family that never really got along with each other at all. My mom had issues of her own before i was born and from what i’ve heard about my biological father the same thing was relevant in his case. I’d say when i was around 4 or so years old my mother was getting me ready for bed and she ended up smacking me in the face and it left a bad bruise. Long story short i had school the next day and blah blah blah... cps was now involved. 


   My grandmother ended up taking me in and i can’t thank her enough, but by this point she had not wanted to raise kids all over again. So her patience was never there and she didn’t really care to pay attention to me or my brother. She was also very naive and would believe a 3rd party rather than herself or anyone close to her. I used to have a really bad time at school and dealt with bullying constantly. It didn’t matter how many times i told my grandmother, she was too busy. So then the bullying got worse, and i would eventually get into fights and end up in iss everyday. 


   That is the only time she noticed, when she kept getting calls from the schools. You’d think then she’d want to question me and wonder whats going on, but nope it was always “cut it out you know better” “why do you act like a heathen?” So school on top of coming home and getting yelled at and grounded non-stop my depression eventually ate away at me and it would turn into anger. When i was in those moods i was in an “idc” mood, i’d skip school as often as possible and didn’t care whether i got grounded or not. It was gonna happen anyways so honestly why should i care? 


   After awhile i was then put into counseling and they tried to get me to use coping skills and such and it finally seemed like someone knew just what i was going through for the first time ever. I would cry happy tears and loved the counselors office! It felt more “home” than home. The only problem was that for coping skills and stuff like that to work, my grandmother would have to do work to like hearing me out and letting me scream into a pillow. However, this was not the case. As soon as we got out of the counselors office she was back to her old self, yelling at me, and blaming me. I think she felt as though counseling would somehow “fix” her “screwed up” grandchild that she had to take in because her daughter failed as a parent.


   So she resorted to other things to somehow “fix” me without doing any work herself on just hearing me out or trying to be involved. That is where the mental institutions began. I was in and out to no avail constantly until i was then put into long-term for 4 months and 28 days (Yes i counted.) I finally got out and was happy because even though i was out of my “home environment” and i should of been happy i was homesick. I always loved my grandmother even throughout everything she put me through so i was homesick regularly. I was confused by that and still am to this day.


   From that point on across my entire family i was now known as the “crazy kid.” I was mental, nobody else was. It was as if i was contaminated, nobody wanted to be near me, talk to me, and when we lost our house and my brother and my grandmother and grandfather had to stay at the in-laws, i wasn’t allowed. Luckily i had a friend and his parents decided to take me in for the time being. I would go to school and the same stuff that happened to me in 08, would still happen through junior high. At that point i just gave up. I was done, i went into the bathroom at 1:34 A.M.  sometime early january of 2014 and i lost it. Nobody was home, it was perfect i thought.


   I was just standing there looking at the mirror over and over forever it felt like and i was contemplating suicide... i punched the mirror hoping my fist would go through it and the jagged edges would slice my wrists. It wasn’t thick enough so the mirror only cracked and my fists didn’t go through so there was no cuts. I picked up a sharp jagged piece and started motioning as though i was already cutting, but instead hovering. I guess i knew it wasn’t worth it and just sighed really hard... I was shaking because i really felt i wanted it over, but at the same time not.


   My grandfather passed later that year, and it bothered me a bunch. I was just starting my sophomore year in high school of august 2014. Well i got through around half of the year sometime in april and gave up. I dropped out, i didn’t care about anything... i didn’t feel a need for a suicide attempt, but if if a car came out of no where i don’t know that i’d be too worried. After that i stayed secluded in my room, i strayed away from anything that would involve me to be social and developed anxiety. Now i have both depression and anxiety. I have been the same since 2015, i care very little about anything. I have plenty of time on my hands as i’m 20 years old now and am on ssi due to debilitating mental illness.


   It gets worse every day because i know i haven’t done anything productive in years and i sleep to pass the time... i feel stupid for dropping out, but then again i don’t. I’m back and forth on everything in my life until eventually i become emotionally exhausted and fall asleep. What would appear to be normal everyday decisions society would make in an instant may take me days to weeks. That type of thinking then spirals me down into depression. I care too much about everything and need tons of reassurance on anything and feel incapable daily. Common thoughts that run through my head are “what does your future look like?” I can’t answer that. My friends are out having kids and loving life. Here i am and can’t even go to the grocery store without having a panic attack.


   People think i’m lazy, and i can’t explain it. I wish they knew, i really do. I try my best to hide it around company or family so maybe i’m to blame for that. I just don’t know what exactly it is i’m here for and i need a purpose. I want to do great things, but unfortunately the only things that are great are my dreams. Hobbies that i used to love i’m not holding an interest. I feel like a waste of space and it bothers me until it doesn’t and i fall asleep. I then wake up and repeat, this is hell...

""To get the full value of joy, you must have someone to divide it with."" -Mark Twain

I've been married 15 years and have never felt so alone. I haven't experienced depression until this year. I know what the root of my depression is and I'm going to make a change. I told myself this year it's my turn to be happy.

If someone in your life is that 'divide' whom you can share joy with, hold on to them. Keep that person in your life.

I feel the change I need to make is going to hurt others but the change is right for me. That also puts me in a depressed mood. However the long term results in more happiness. I need to stay focused on my goal and fight through the short term.

256,"     On friday afternoon, during math class I  just kind of broke. I took a mechanical pencil and began scratching at my skin. I had cut myself earlier in the year, like a time in October, but I thought I would never do it again. I was wrong. Any way after math we had electives and I had chorus. Chorus was with my favorite teacher, let's call him M. during chorus I was a lot more irratable but I didnt have the energy to do anything, so I essentially kind of curled up in a ball and sang (lol). During homeroom two of my good friends comforted me.
     After homeroom I went to M in a daze. When I walked in and said hi and he said how he noticed that I seemed bummed during chorus (I'm usually very happy in his classes) and asked if I was ok. I told him ""eh."" I was very blunt with my statement (it took me like thirty seconds to get any words out of my mouth) when saying I cut myself. He looked up with a sad look and asked where. I should him my arms and was feeling really dizzy from all the thoughts in my head. Anyway, M knew about my depression and knew that I had therapy but he said that it hurt him to see a student/friend in so much pain that they let it out on themselves. He told me he was extremely flattered that I came to him to talk about this and hoped i understood his job*** and hoped that didnt break my trust with him

It has shifted my entire life, I had to drop the majority of my classes and still struggle every day with it. This morning I got blackout drunk and took a nasty spill which fucked up my face and hands bad, and proceeded to be driven home by my ""friends"" who left me bleeding in my bathroom on my back. 

I scared the shit out of my family. When I finally had the balls to do it I went upstairs and asked my dad if we could talk about what happened. He talked about my substance use and my chronic pain and pretty much everything, but what stood out was he said ""if you are going to kill yourself, just fucking do it"" and it sounds fucked up but that is what I needed to hear. I'm not going to take the easy way out, and I won't romanticize suicide as an escape anymore.

Now I'm in an internship again. What I would like advice with, is how to stay motivated and showing my best side while at work. If an opening shows up, maybe I will be in a good position to get it, who knows. But it's hard to put your best face on and stay motivated when you're working full time (some days overtime), same as everyone else, while getting just what I got when I didn't have any job (like government benefits). The sense of unfairness creeps up pretty often and the feeling that I'm just being taken advantage of me.

The internship lasts 4 months. I have 3 months left. The thought of going back to square one terrifies me.

263,"This Wednesday on the train I realized bicycles are big. I spent the whole week anguished. Every day when getting out of the station to catch my bus to school, I walk by a perfect place to kill yourself. Then I look down and think: do I jump or do I not? It isn't time and I would be disturbing traffic with my dead body: I don't like arriving late and then I shouldn't like to cause others to arrive late. I don't jump. I spent the rest of the week looking for a bike as big as the one I saw at Wednesday.

I had a French presentation at Sunday; I did a presentation on Jean-Luc Godard. ""présenterai, Nouvelle Vague, Nouvelle Vague..."" I repeat. The girl from the Military School did a presentation on the Adams Family. Curious, the only family I know, besides my own, is the Kardashian. I can't speak French correctely because of my speech problem. When I was younger, my mom used to tell me that after going to speech therapist and getting my problem fixed, she'd enroll me at French classes. I didn't go to speech therapist, I didn't get my problem fixed. I'm anguished: I should've been learning Dutch. In the Netherlands, euthanasia is allowed for psychiatric cases. Suicide should be a human right. I don't care if your life has been good until now; my few happy memories - they are still quite miserable - are my Philosophy teacher giving me a periodical on phenomenology because a question I had asked her and my friend hugging me.

Monday, a classmate mentioned how bald I was and then started to mock my baldness. I cried hiddenly, while I cursed his region for breeding out such mannerless people. Now I do confess it, declare it an isolated case and say that I've already expiated my sins.

I'll always be no one even though I do wish to be everything. I'll forever be me, something that terrorizes me. I'll never write *A Tabacaria*. I might try to rewrite it, but I won't suceed at it. I'll always be lonely and have no friends. I'll never do anything grand, anything of medium stature or anything at all. I'll always be the one living in the garret, even if I don't live in one.

I'm 25 and I've had far more bad days than good ones - how is this a temporary fucking problem at this point?

A few months ago I ended a relationship because I knew my mental health was holding me back from being the better boyfriend I could have been. I didn’t find it fair to her that I wasn’t the best me and that I couldn’t support her led alone  support myself. 

Recently, one of my best friends made a move on me. I really do love her but yet the same thing goes for her. I’m not happy with myself and I can’t support her either. The shit that goes on in my mind is fucking me up. It’s always “yours not good enough for her” or “you two aren’t really together and she’ll find someone else” but the thing is, the more I think about it, the more I begin to realize, i don’t want her to like me, i want her to be happy and to not miss out on the chance of finding someone who can maker her happy. It’s gonna hurt and I know that but I’d prefer to hurt than take away her dating life/happiness.

I’m so conflicted cause I really want her but I just can’t have her. I’m not stable and I fear that’s what’s going to be my downfall. I don’t want to hurt her and I’ve already stated my concerns very clearly to her.  I hate thinking this way. I don’t know what to do",0
267,"I don’t want to sound negative and usually i’m the happy go lucky kind of girl. but i cannot help but feel like if there’s a strange aura around me that people are aware of but i’m not? I‘ll give you an example of an experience that had repeated itself a few times. I‘ll make it very short. I had people cancel our planned holiday 
a few times and can’t help but wonder why? Sure there were different reasons. But now i feel so extremely anxious about any planned trips that i cannot trust anyone at all anymore. 
First time happened with a long distance bf who broke up. I had to cancel the flight. It was hard but it was ok. 2nd time was a few years later, another LDR (who used to live here but moved away) who told me to cancel the flight. I couldn’t handle it and we talked and ended up just postponing the flight. I couldn’t handle that it would happen again. The relationship went on for another 2years and ended because he had severe mental issues as well as commitment issues (reason why we had so many problems) that he just couldn’t overcome. During the relationship he had promised many times to come see me and ended up cancelling his flight last minute. 

Oh almost forgot about a friend i planned to go on holiday with, this time i cancelled last minute because she hurt my feelings. I cut her off. Another holiday with another friend she cancelled because she got pregnant and wasn’t able to fly.
I never wanted to feel like that about myself but When things repeat themselves you can’t help but wonder why. And if it’s you? It’s different scenarios, different reasons, but it’s like something keeps me from travelling? 
The ironic thing is that i‘m usually very positive and happy most of the time and people do like me. Actually i am even a people magnet when i first meet them.
But it’s like close friendships or relationships are so hard. 
I cut people off easily when they disappoint me. And in a relationship i refuse to „give it up“ and end up getting hurt. Like i don’t even know what’s i‘m doing right or wrong anymore.",0
268,"idk how common this is, but I just tell people I'm ""pretty good"" whenever they ask me how I'm doing. Always. I've tried opening up, to therapists to psychologists to my friends and family before, and sure while for the most part they were supportive, they treat me like they're walking on eggshells and I could break at any second, and some outright just stopped talking to me as much or kind of pushed me out of the circles I was in. It's humiliating. I've cut off most people since then besides my family. Whenever someone asks how I'm doing now, it's always ""pretty good"". I never am.

271,"I have this maniacal laughter that rings in my head. This insane hilarity of how pathetic I’ve become. I’ve allowed myself to transform into this privately, hopeless blob of pointless self-satisfaction. 

You know, I used to not care about romantic/intimate non-family love. I’m 26 now. I’ve never had a girlfriend. Not surprisingly, I’ve never kissed a girl or been kissed. And I’m a virgin (shocker at this point right?). I REALLY used to not even think about this stuff. Halfway through college (maybe 2014ish), when I was maybe 21 or 22, something clicked at one point. The desire for love had finally died. Middle school was more of a superficial desire for a girlfriend; high school was more of a lustful desire; college was a mix of both, as I grew older I guess. 

There were countless crushes throughout my schooling. A couple girls approached me with a relationship. I was shallow so I declined. They weren’t one of my crushes so they didn’t stand a chance with my arrogance. I should’ve said yes. Hindsight. 

Being raised by a father who was a closet homosexual and a family tree of nothing but divorcees, hasn’t exactly helped my relationship status. The old-fashioned view of a father is one who prepares his son for the world and prepares him for the ladies, if you will. My dad says he has always had thoughts (speaking about him being gay). It’s kind of hard for a gay father to prepare his heterosexual son for future relationships.

When I was maybe 11 or 12 years old, I was shipped off to my super religious grandparents where I learned manners and stuff. And in high school I was in JROTC. I have had plenty of lessons in manners and leadership. I see now how it was so easy to not pay attention to women as a primary focus.

This coupled with a festering lack of self-esteem has made it ridiculously easy to stay single. Once I hit 21 or 22 years old, I only thought about love once in a blue moon. And when I did, it didn’t hurt.

Fast forward to 2018 when I met Sixty-Six when she started working for the company I work for. Naturally blonde with the most beautiful green eyes I have ever seen. She has a boyfriend. At the time, their relationship was a bit rocky. He eventually started working for us. Excellent! 

I eventually tell her that I like her only for her to say she also likes me. How about that? Her and I start to hang out. Fast forward six months and a few suicide attempts later or so to now.

What happened? What changed? Well she slept in my bed three times but we never had sex. The first one was mainly because it was three in the morning and we were both super tired after watching TV so I don’t count that one. The other two times though… I am going to regret not making a move until I die which probably will be soon. I have so much working against me. I have my honor which prevents me from doing anything because she is with somebody else. I have my workplace Anxiety. I don’t want to make a move and be wrong only to ruin our work relationship forever. And of course by default, my virginity anxiety. It’s easy to fear what you have not experienced. At the time I tried to convince myself that she maybe had something to drink or just wanted to be super cuddly and did not actually want to have sex. My closest friend is someone who I can confide in. He says if a girl is in your bed that she wants to have sex. That seems simple enough but I did not buy it with her. The third time she slept over was the most obvious that she wanted to have sex. Obviously I didn’t make a move by the end of it. She went out of her way to come over to my apartment at midnight and within 30 to 40 minutes say she is tired. She even wanted to wear one of my shirts to bed. I’m such an idiot. She was laying there facing the other direction with her head on my arm. I kept feeling her eyelashes move up and down because she was blinking. She did not have her eyes closed obviously. That means she was laying there with her eyes open waiting for something. At this point I’ll never get this chance again so opportunity forever missed. If she took off her clothes or just straight up asked me if I wanted to have sex, problem solved. 

But when I go back and review why I feel so empty, The fact that she reopened a void of romantic love is not the issue entirely. It’s because I have been blue-balled at least 3 times by the girl of my dreams. I just need to get laid at this point. I need to see if my depression is rooted in virginity or love or both. 

But I only want her. So it’s not like I can just go run around town looking for a one night stand. It won’t answer the question. But then again I’ll never be with Sixty-Six. So now I’m in a loop. And I want to die now more than ever. 

The universe puts someone of significance in your life for a reason. I pondered on that in my original “Sixty-Six” post with the cosmic signs of 66 that trace back to my kindergarten year. 

A little far fetched of a theory but I think that she and I are supposed to have been soulmates but that we met at the wrong time. I think I have realized this over time and that there’s nothing I can do to escape this hell. I can’t change the timing, and I can’t change how our “relationship” has progressed and withered. Her relationship with her boyfriend seems stronger than ever. I can’t undo what she has done to me and God knows I can never tell her. I fear that if I do, I’ll be so dead inside and emotionless that it seems insincere. But I ball my eyes out as I type this. She has never seen me cry and I intend to keep it that way. I prefer to cower behind my phone. 

Just like I mentioned in my original post, I will wait it out til Avengers 4 which is now officially called Avengers Endgame. I’ll persevere until then. Once I complete that 10-year movie arc at the end of this month, I’ll truly have nothing left to live for. 

That means I have at least 3 full weeks left on this earth. After then, I doubt my survival. I’m sorry, Mom.

I used to be one of those people who brushed their teeth twice a day, flossed, used cologne, etc.

I just showered for the first time in a week. It was a struggle. I also just did laundry for the first time in who knows how long. Wore the same outfit down to the sock for about two weeks.

280,"I started Wellbutrin XL at 150mg exactly one month ago. Besides the loss of appetite and some slight jitters I was fine. That is up until a week ago when things got weird. 

I had a supposed IBS flare up that had me sitting weird from bladder urges and pelvic pressure. Now I have a bruised coccyx from sitting weird BUT ANYWAYS..

I’m expecting my period on 4/16, and just yesterday I had some brown discharge after my first workout since my IBS/bruised coccyx.. looks like the light discharge you might get after or before your period. Now today it’s just the lightest brown with a touch of pink.. barely even discharge. 

I’m on the 28 day combo pill and I take it religiously, 6:30am every day without fail.  I highly doubt it’s implantation bleeding, and I did have a negative first response pregnancy test. My periods don’t come like perfect clockwork, but they have never started a whole 10 days early on their own unless I missed a BC pill! 

I’m going to call my doctor this week if it doesn’t let up.. but has anyone else experienced weird periods on Wellbutrin? I know BC and bodily stress can make your periods funky, but this has never once happened to me. ",0
281,"For the longest time I’ve always painted as an outlet to get rid of all my feelings, and painting was fun and great and all of the positive feedback I’d get was awesome too. That was really all I had, and all I needed since it was working just fine. But now it’s like I’ve just broken and I don’t know how to create art anymore. As my depressive symptoms have been getting worse, I’ve lost all of my ability to vent through my art. Every time I sit down to paint it comes out looking like garbage, and the beautiful inspiring image I had in my mind is now ruined and gone because I fucked it up. I’ve been trying so hard to get back in the swing of it but it’s just not working. So many things in my life are hurting me and are causing me to suffer so greatly and I have no way of letting any of that out and it’s building up, worse and worse. 

Now for the first time in months I’ve been inspired by something, really truly inspired to create in a way I haven’t felt for so long. Usually this feeling gets me so excited in such a wonderful way, but all I felt now is a pain in my chest. It hurts so much because the image I have in my head is so beautiful, and I want to paint it so badly, but I can’t bear the thought of ruining it. I don’t have any more watercolor paper and I wanted to go out and buy some so I could try but I feel like it’s not even worth it. This might seem silly but I always know before even starting if a painting is going to work, and sometimes I’ve waited months until I’ve felt ready to do it because I knew it would flop if I rushed it. And this feels like it won’t work. Every time I fail all of the feelings I have bottled up intensify to the point where I can’t handle it and I break down for days on end. I need to get through school and I don’t think I can handle it on top of being a senior and stressing about college and my future. I feel so trapped and lost. ",0

3. I have multiple sclerosis, last Sunday I was discharged from the hospital after a 3 day stay in order to address an exacerbation related to it that is causing me to lose vision in one eye and feeling/sensation in both feet and legs, admittedly this is due to not being able to afford my maintenance medications after losing prescription health coverage due to not being able to afford it, despite assistance from the pharmaceutical companies

303,"Listening to music, laying here scrolling through Reddit, come across several posts about being diagnosed with terminal illnesses with limited timeframes on their life, and it hit me hard... 
I'm astounded at how well some individuals can cope with new knowledge that their life will be limited now, and most have children, or are surrounded by family that will be left behind. I'm sure they let the emotions out behind closed doors, but damn... what an overwhelming sense of finality to life... that in 1 moment, its changed forever, or gone forever. Most of us suffer through some days, carrying emotional burdens we wish we didn't have to bear. I just see now that although the outlook may seem bleak, or some days dont seem worth pushing through, but damnit, there is ALWAYS someone who has it worse than myself... having that realization doesn't negate my pain or suffering but it damn sure makes me realize that instead of dwelling in the silence, or dwelling in the suck, embrace it, face it, and CHANGE it. We owe it to ourselves, because our time here is finite. 

""Yesterday is gone, Today is all we have, and Tomorrow is not guaranteed"" (some wise person said) 

""Those who acknowledge their weakness 
Become strong"" -Tao Te Ching

Acknowledge the fact that we face difficult shit, that life isn't perfect nor always cracked up to be what we imagined it to be. But we can pave new roads before our feet, changing our direction, with a course steered more towards positive growth, new energy, and surrounding ourselves with people and things that can help us become better, to grow and learn, and hopefully leave a positive impact on the Earth, and those whose path we crossed along the way. Life is too short for us to dwell in our struggles. We should help each other, even in this virtual sense we can lift eachother up and out of the funk we find ourselves in. I hope this resonates with someone, It just all hit me like a brick, and gave me renewed hope that things can be better, but it starts with changing our mindset. ",0

There’s lots of people with depression and anxiety who have shit to bring to the table. Look at Robin Williams.

This is going to sound extremely rude but hear me out. I love my parents to death, they really do the most for me. When they bought me a car last fall, I was very happy but the way I expressed my happiness was probably not at the level they were expecting. I’m genuinely grateful for what they did, and it hurts me to hear them talk about how they thought I would be more happy. 

My friends have told me that I never seem happy around them and that they’ve questioned whether I really like them or not in the beginning of our friendship. As they’ve come to know me, they told me that they know I’m cut and dry so they don’t take it personally anymore. 

It’s lead me to question who I really am, and sometimes I feel like a sociopath. Should I be feeling more excited, happy, and overall enjoy these moments more? I’ve been seeing a therapist for 3 years now and me being clinically depressed has not come up once.

310,"My Boyfriend (22M) and myself (21FM) have been together for 4 years now. He was married to his ex whilst they were very young and it turned out to be a huge mistake as they ended up divorced after 6 months.

I know his ex was his first love, his one and only relationship before me, so i naturally found it uncomfortable discussing her even before I met her.

The circumstances we met (myself and his ex) in were absolutely awful. I got a new job which i loved at the new MAC Cosmetics store in my area, a lot of us were recruited and on the first day, after recognising her name and a picture of her he had once shown me, i realised I would be working with this girl for the foreseeable. The minute I saw her i felt instantly sick with insecurity, I suffer with terrible terrible depression and a lot of the time my confidence and self esteem is terribly low, a lot of the time I really hate myself. This girl was truly truly beautiful, like one of the most beautiful girls I had seen in my life, she was everything I wasn't, she had beautiful features, long hair, perfect skin, a gorgeous slim body, everything was just perfect. I didn't tell my boyfriend she was working with me, as I know he still holds a place for her in his heart-naturally as she was his first love. I didn't want him asking me 21 questions about her, or coming to my workplace to see her, or anything like that. I also didn't want him to make me leave my job, a job I loved so much. Every-time I was around her I would fight back tears, and just stare at her wondering, what was their relationship like? Did he laugh with her about the things we do? Did he take her where he takes me? Being around her I would die inside with insecurity.

So I kept out of her way, I alerted my managers to not put me on the same shifts as her, and they did listen and follow the best they could. However, one shit, I had to work with her. She was discussing her relationship status with myself and a few colleagues, and then out of nowhere, she said she had a boyfriend..casually...I asked her what his name was? And she said MY boyfriends name..that he was her boyfriend. Destroyed inside, After my shift finished, I drove to my boyfriends and told him everything, how she was saying they were still together, and she also said he was going to take her out that day etc. My boyfriend was shellshocked, and swore blind this wasn't the case, and she was desperate to have him back, he swore on his life, and i believe him. Yet he wanted me to leave my job, after seeing the damage to my mental health. So I had to. I haven't been back in that store, or seen her since.

This incident was 9 months ago now, and I wont even set foot in that shopping centre where the MAC store is, without feeling sick and anxious and paranoid. If I go happen to go in the shopping centre, I stay in shops far away from that area, under fear i may see her. i feel absolutely petrified of seeing her and comparing myself to her, she is so so beautiful and it tips me over the edge when I see her. Why am i LIKE THIS? for months now, anything my boyfriend does, I am scared he is texting her, even though he has proved he is telling the truth many times, even if I see a name beginning with her letter, I assume it is her. I always always ask him, if he prefers her over me, but he says no. I twist words he says, accusing him of being with her, accusing him of wanting her back. I feel like I am seeing her face in everyone I see, people that i know are not her, people who resemble her features, I make out and fear it is her in my head and my heart starts pounding.

I cant even go back to that store, or shopping centre. i drive halfway across the city just to run errands, when this shopping centre is 5 minutes from my house, just out of fear of seeing her. I have mentioned to my boyfriend how much this has affected me, but he dosent understand, he says that she ruined his life more than she has mine, and that I am just over-reacting and being stupid.

​

Can somebody explain why this has affected my life so much? I literally am terrified of seeing her, and I do not know how to move on from this, it really is destroying my life, my relationship, and i dont know how to move on. How do I explain how bad it is to my boyfriend? and why do I feel like this is driving me crazy?

It sucks, I’m in a constant state of hating life feeling like I’m wasting every second I have on the earth, and that I’m not doing enough. I can’t sit down and relax for like 5 minutes without feeling worthless and like I’m wasting time. It gives me this strange feeling, I really want to go and do more things, but I’m exhausted and never want to go do more things. It is very conflicting and mentally draining. And all of those feeling make me feel worthless. My girlfriend says she thinks the way my parents talk to me also just reinforces how I feel. I honestly dislike my situation. I’ve been considering a career change and a break from school but even then idk if I’ll feel content. That’s the other thing, I don’t feel content with life and what has happened so far.

My life has recently been completely destroyed. I came home from work about 3 weeks ago, sat down to eat dinner with my fiance who I lived with and had been with for the last five years. She told me mid dinner that she wasn't happy anymore and wanted to split up. This blind sided me as I have gone over the last months a million times and saw no hint of this unhappiness. We lived together but the lease was in her name. So I packed up my stuff and left that night for my only relatives that could take me in, my parents who live in the next state over.  Basically in one night, I lost my fiance, my home, my job, and my two wonderful dogs. I'm currently unemployed, have no friends as I've always been kinda a loner, and sit at home dwelling on this almost 24/7. I have no one to talk to, and no amount of whiskey is numbing the pain. I only feel ok when I sleep or play video games for 4 hours straight. Idk what I expect from this. I just need someone to here me. Talk to me. Idk what. But I'm hurting. I know things will get better and I'll be ok eventually. Right now though I see no light at the end of the tunnel. I cant sleep right now, I took some benadryl to try to force it so if I dont respond I will when I wake up. Thanks to anyone who wants to listen. ",0
316,"So I had sex last night and it felt terrible (for me at least). I'm currently on SSRI's to cope with my depression but I never imagined that they would affect my sexual performance by that much. What basically happened was that I could barely keep an erection and my dick felt numb. It sucks and I hate myself for disappointing my partner. It's kind of making me want to get off them because I've been on them for a few months and haven't noticed much of a difference and it's making one of the few things I still enjoy shit.

I'm curious what people think I should do. Also if you were/still are on antidepressants why did you stop/keep going with it.

318,"I remember clearly the night that I had my first panic attack. It was 25 December 2017 and i was depressed. It was Christmas, everyone was having a great time and i was suffocated by negative thoughts, depression, anxiety, agony and most of all: guilt. I have always been a sensible person and I remember when i was a kid, i used to tell my mother everything bad that i did, even if it was soemthing stupid like stepping on a bug. I would confess my ""sins"" and then i would feel better, but i hated it. I hated that i was the only one who couldn't keep a secret from his mom because the feelings of guilt were to strong and wouldn't leave me alone. It was horrible. That night, the feelings of guilt and anxiety built up very quickly, i couldn't think straight, i started to hyperventilate and shiver, i started screaming and shouting that i was going to die and i definetly thought i would. I somehow managed to go to sleep and for that night, i was safe. So much of a Christmas...The next week it happened again, but this time, it was even worse. I had no one to talk to apart from my parents, but as i said before, i didn't want to ""confess"", i wanted to find another way to cope with my feelings and learn to live without having the urge to tell my parents everything i did. During the attacks, i also thought about suicide, i saw it as the only way to solve my problems, but a part of me, wanated to keep going. One night i told myself: ""I'm going to kill myself"". and the moment i said it outloud, i knew it was a crazy idea. It couldn't end that way. It didn't have to. and so I MADE A CHOICE. i chose to fight. i chose to fight against myself and now i won. It took me a year, but now i'm living the life that i want. i learned how to cope with negative feelings and depression. I read books, watched videos, meditated, did yoga, started going to the gym and finally, after a year i did it. And do you want to know how i knew that it was over? (apart from my attacs going away...) well, i confessed to my best friend, and the moment i did, i didn't feel free, i didn't feel better in any way, because i had leraned to live with my demons and i was stronger. I HAD WON. I love you all guys and the only thing that i want to do now that i no longer suffer from depression, is to help you. I want to increase happiness and positivity in everyone's life. Stay strong, stay positive and don't forget to ask for help, it is a noble and decent act. I'm always here for you. If i did it, so can you.",0
319,"The last few years have been a double edged sword. In 2017 I met an amazing girl who I love and trust unconditionally. Made amazing memories throughout the end of 2017 and through 2018, kept in contact every day whenever we weren’t able to be together and we were so happy. She was my rock and I was hers, through thick and thin no matter what.

Unfortunately January of this year I fucked up that relationship by letting my insecurities and depression take complete control and said something stupid that I regret to this day. Nothing disrespectful towards her but just naive and dumb. We are currently on a “break”. 

I am having financial troubles, family issues, general depression is constantly looming over my head, heavy anxiety about where the relationship will go, worries about my new job I’m supposed to be starting soon. Pressure from all angles and I’m constantly on the verge of tears or a meltdown.

Nothing is as enjoyable as it once was. All I feel day in and day out is just complete sadness. The last time I truly felt alive and felt that hot, genuine happiness was when I was with my incredible girlfriend. I know you shouldn’t put 100% of yourself into someone but she  really did keep me whole, strong and sane.

I just want to escape all of this shit for good. The thought of suicide is lingering all day every day as of late, I flirt with the idea more each time.

I feel like shit complaining here because I know there are people worse off than me but it’s just too much.",0
320,"I’ve gotten better at not self loathing all the time over the years. And hey, I’m only 19. But some days it really gets to me. The kind of life that I live. The obsessively anxious lifestyle. The very minimal social interaction. All the pressure from other people, the things they’re doing and the things I’m not doing that they talk to me about. The comments they’ve made about me in the past. “Andy’s going to end up being a loser”, “you have all these mental problems because you’re a selfish bitch”. I’m really introverted. I have a few good friends. We don’t do much, but I like them because our relationships seem genuine even though they aren’t very exciting. I don’t have much planned for my life. Some days I don’t even feel like I want to live it. I feel bad cause I know my mom would hate to know how I feel about myself. She probably has very high hopes me for me and I just don’t seem to look at myself the same way. I don’t know, maybe today is just one of those days. ",0
321,I feel very weird right now. I am moving slowly and everything seems surreal. I was brushing my teeth and I couldn't get myself to grip the toothbrush hard enough and it kept slipping down my hands. I just took two advil PM's to help me fall asleep. I don't know what to do.,0
322,"Made an effort to make friends today. Putting up a facade is exhausting. The air was thick with joy and I didn’t feel like it was my place. I was hanging out with this group and they only knew the “me” I showed them. The real me can’t function in society. He doesn’t smile, he doesn’t have any social skills and he sure as fucking hell oozes his retched feelings in the atmosphere around him. Trying to fit in hurts. It’s not hard, but it takes a lot out of me. Maybe I’m just not cut out for society yet. 

Update: was just told by someone while I’m writing this post that I’m hated. Nice. I deserve it I guess. Now I have a small purpose, I’m a scape goat for someone’s negative emotions. Can’t say I’m useless anymore at least but still hurt to hear the words. Can’t really do much else right now so I guess I’ll take a teary nap. ",0

324,"Im a highschooler right now, age 17 in my third year. I don't want much pity or help just want to express the way I feel. To others this may seem childish but to me it hurts.

Im a loner, and im VERY introverted and speak to maybe 3 or 4 people a day. Ive been an outcast kid since my early grades and its stuck with me my entire school carrer. Ive been that one kid in gym class that gets pushed around more or picked on for doing the slightest/sillyest things. On top of being bullied I was not helped by my teachers and was being picked on BY a teacher.

Along with being introverted im not very attractive, so any chance of someone wanting to talk to me is almost a miracle. Im not hideous but also not even close to good looking. No chisled jaw but also no fat or really noticible defects. 

Ive always wanted a girlfriend, but never had the charisma, looks, skills, or wit to ever say something to the person I liked. I've had those moments where I did though. A good example is when I did have a great friendship with someone, I had enough courage so I asked them out. They said yes initially but hours later I get a text saying they messed up and they didnt actually like me, they later completely dont talk to me and ignores me every time I try to talk to them.
 
That put me in a really bad depression and im still struggling from it, ive tried forgetting but anytime I try to put myself out there I think about when that happened and always get scared and back off. I liked a girl for two whole months but never said a word to her. Everytime I got near her it was like I opened my mouth but just kept walking past knowing that I could get rejected the same way again.

Having all of these thoughts has brought me down to a level noone wants to be, my mental state has brought me to waking up only wanting to go back to sleep. School no longer matters, other things that I truly care about are starting to become less and less fun. I play games alot, I am top charts and have a world record. But those games are just time passing things now. Im hurt and want to be helped but i dont want to, because at this point i dont even have pity for myself.

Ive stopped eating some days, brushing my hair, doing regular human things all because im starting to feel like I dont deserve to. Im putting myself in the image of what everyone thinks I probably do and worse.

330,"I have no idea why I’m posting this. I’ve (29F)  just been so terribly depressed lately. I work 84 hrs a week just to still work pay check to pay check. All my friends are too busy/far away/don’t care enough to hang out with. Most of my friends have gotten married and started families or worked on their careers which brought them across the country or world. I try hard to stay in contact but recently no one responds to my reaching out. My boyfriend and I argue all the time. My best friend (sister in law)  and nieces live 11 hours away and I haven’t seen them in a year cause I can’t afford to travel or miss a day of work. I’m close with my parents but haven’t had time to spend with them lately. 

I’m sleeping too much. Nothing interests me. I’ve tried to commit suicide three times in the last two years and have been inpatient all three times. I go to a therapist, psychiatrist, and am even trying this new treatment called TMS. Nothing works. 

I’ve called into work all week this past week except one day. I feel awful but I also don’t care if I get fired at this point. My second job is all consuming on the weekends as it’s a 48hr shift. I’m just so tired. 

I’m tired of arguing. I’m tired of not having fun in life. I have no hobbies or interests anymore. I don’t care about much. I’ve tried to get my bf to break up with me because I don’t deserve him. And also cause I just wanna be left alone to rot. 

I was at work tonight and had all my pills out to take. Instead I called the suicide hotline and she listened to me. It helped me not kill my self in the moment but long term I just don’t know what to do. I have no motivation. I just wanna disappear. 

If you made it this far, thanks for reading. Again, I’ve no idea where to go from here. Meds, inpatient treatment, outpatient group therapy, one on one therapy, psychiatrist, meditation, exercise, just none of it works. I feel broken and like I’ll never be free of this pain. ",0
331,"Waking life is the most depressing part of the day when you are ashamed of yourself.

reemerging into a life full of pain and self loathing. How did I get to this point? Maybe it was the realization that I always was at this point. An awkward distant boy that only really wanted to lose the totality of his surroundings. Disgusted with a world of bureaucracy and increased urbanization. A phony reality with the necessary allusion of limitless potential— to drive forward society and individuals with self improvement to an end of what now? With the rise of engineering and manufacturing that has made life easier it seems our youth are faced with an ever increasing search for meaning to fill in all the work they were spared from. What is my purpose in this skin of mine? Do I conform, get educated, and learn ways I can advance civilization knowing well that the advancements breed a whole host of other issues that plague the mind of billions? Do I take up arms to fight with no perspicuous cause? Do I help the people that are struggling to make it to the next tier of life, romanticizing about some lifestyle devoid of problems just out of reach. Do I wander aimlessley around some wilderness away from civilization and revert back to a primitive lifestyle? Do I conform and hang out with the majority of types whom I wish I had enough of a willpower to fully despise?

I hate every aspect of the world I live in. I want to watch it all burn down, or find a way to escape it. I’m not talented in anything and its hard to concentrate my efforts on one area especially when every conscious second I am made aware of the plentiful areas I fall short in. Get rich is the narrative of my country. Get educated and cash a big corporate check so you can live in the next cookie cutter and drive a moderately shiny toaster that will be rusty in 10 years. And as atrocious as that sounds it seems to be the dead end. What else is there to do? Be a YouTuber that travels the world in search of thrilling places and adventures? How long can that last before the same dreadful thoughts come right back to haunt and cripple. And 30 millennials decide to do the same thing and now your market is saturated. Is that what you were brought on this earth to do? drink coronas on a Mexican beach and go skim diving in the Bahamas? Or was it to work for a tech giant that creates the devices where we can lose ourselves in another augmented reality.

If there was one question for it— What to do? As if you really have a choice. Every option is the boulder and you will never not be Sisyphus. Sure there is headway. Each ascend you make is an inch further from when you lost traction the last time. On a mountain miles high, and the only thing you really know. You have names for every pebble and weed you pass on your eternal climb.

Thinking is dangerous sometimes. It can send you into the next loopy chrysalis that will paralyze you. How are you going to roll the boulder if you lay in bed all day?

Give me cyanide and a shotgun. Give me a bible. Give me love, a woman, that will rescue me from the void I’m in.

I was also really lucky to meet teachers who cared for students and going to school brought me joy. Waking up at 7:30 in the morning and sprinting to school at 8:15 was what I did every day, and I was so healthy and happy then. Got nothing to complain about those years.

&amp;#x200B;

I'd be awake around 8am but I've been struggling with getting my day started for many months now. On weekends, I won't get up till 5pm.  

I decided to copy my middle school rotating class schedule. Each period lasted 45 minutes and had 10-minute breaks in between periods. I broke my morning into 45 minute-long periods and I got my ass to a cafe or a library at 9am just like I'd be ready for the first period. And took ten-minute breaks in between to stretch. 

Example)

9:00 - 9:45: meditation podcast and self-improvement reading

9:55 - 10:40: miscellaneous paperwork 

10:50 - 11:35: Studying 1

11:45 - 12: 30: Studying 2

12:30 - 1:30 Lunch

1:40 - 2:25: Python

And so on. 

The 10-minute breaks have been very good for my back and I think it also helps me keep focused throughout the day. Also, you'll be surprised to see how many things you get done in 45 minutes.

I'd tell myself I am going back to school for ""adults"", and it has been fun. Though I don't know for how long this is gonna continue, I did this for a month now.

334,"so, before third grade, i met a girl outside of school (this was summer break). we shared a lot of the same interests and we started hanging out. so, fast-forward to first day of third grade, i realized she transferred to the same school as me. and, all throughout the rest of elementary, we were best friends, she and i hang out with a couple other friends and we did our usual friend stuff (roleplaying, drawing, just nerd stuff). in about fifth grade, my mom had gotten deployed from the army, and, with her gone, my mental state kinda deteriorated..  but then middle-school happened and everything got a lot more worse for me. everything felt like it was sinking. i felt so lost and so helpless. but, at least i had my best friend. my best friend felt like the only thing that was keeping me in check. although, i only got to see her at lunch. (this was because the whole school was separated into two factions and her and i were in different factions) okay, so fast-forward again to about the end of second trimester or so, i was going to be moving soon and so was my best friend. i had already knew i was going to be moving for a long time, but, i didnt know my best friend was moving as well. she moved first, and then so did i. (i moved very far away yikes) before moving in to our new place, i went to go see my mom. (she was coming home from deployment) fastforwarddd— bam im going to a new middle school. it was very hard adjusting and i never made any friends (to this day- i still dont have friends at my school). everyday was hell. i didnt really have anyone to lean on, just online friends. the people there were (and still are) shitty to me. people think they are better than me because my family doesnt have much money and because im unattractive (yes am potato). oftentimes i would go to the restroom stalls and just cry and then end up going back to class. (keep in mind, i actually still do these things haha) and, during this, i never actually contacted my best friend. i was always too scared, even though i know she’s not someone to just throw me away, im scared she’ll judge me and hate me. (i know its stupid;;) i want to reach out to her, but i dont know how. my mom keeps saying that “if its meant to be, its meant to be.” but, i think that theres more to it than that. i just really want to talk to her again and not feel awkward about it.

Ive been feeling a lot better recently thanks to some actuall contact wuth girls and finding some new friends and i was told multiple times how hilarious i am but when i opened up about my apathy and deppression i was given a shallow hug and was left alone for a couple days until i realised that i might aswell hide my feelings for my own sake so that i can at least feel the slight happiness of making a bunch of ppl laugh.

I dated a guy for 2 years who put me down anytime I told him I was feeling depressed, he told me mental health is bs. I left him but when I was with him I cut myself and contemplated suicide a lot. 

Fast forward to now, I’ve been with my current boyfriend for almost a year and I’m genuinely happy. He understands some days I can’t get out of bed or I just need to held. In the time we’ve been together I’ve never once thought of suicide. Tonight he called me crying saying he put his shot gun in his mouth but couldn’t do it because he thought of me and wants a future with me. He does struggle with depression that gets worse with drinking, he is about to graduate college and is terrified of not getting a job or failing to be someone.

342,"Hi Reddit,
This is my first time posting here. But I really need to rant about my life, and I'm very open to advice, I apologize if this isn't the right sub for that. 

I, 24m am badly lost right now. And have been for at least a good year or so. 

I fear that I don't really, and maybe never really had ""my tribe"". My father's an ass. I love my mother, but she can be just as sad and miserable as I am, so it's hard for me to talk to her sometimes. My sister is cool, but she lives hundreds of miles away. My parents never spent much time with our extended family. Except for my Grandparents. But I can't tell them how sad I am. My friends all seem to either live on other ends of the country (USA) or are too busy with their own lives to hang out. I have no girlfriend and haven't for a year now. I'm akward at dating, combined with my depression I don't blame women for running away.

Oh, and I hate my job. Long story. I work in IT, so it pays well. But I would give up this job and even this career in a heart beat if I knew it meant being less lonely.

I'm not a *complete* social recluse either. I have piano lessons. and I play kickball on weekdays. But for some reason I still feel so fucking lonely.

343,"Sorry if this post seems rambling or incoherent at all, I haven't posted on reddit in like 5 years. I just had a particularly bad day and this is the only thing I could think of to make my mood better at all.

I just spent the last 24 hours holed up in my room doing pretty much nothing (mostly starting at the ceiling and lying face down on my bed). I was supposed to do shit today: I want to be a filmmaker and meant to go to an orientation to join an independent filmmaker's group in my city this morning but I ended up sleeping in through that (it's been weeks since I've gotten out of bed before noon). Since the beginning of March my life has been a dumpster fire. I have no job and will just barely be able to afford rent for May (presumably, since I'll be paying for that with my tax returns which I haven't filed yet). I'm enrolled in university, but haven't been to any of my classes or done any course work in a month. I have a term paper due in 22 hours (actually due five days ago but today is the late submission cutoff) which I don't think I'll be able to do at all at this point, meaning I'll be failing one of my classes and may just be able to scrape by with a D in another one. I've left the house maybe once or twice a week for a while now and as such my social circle has slowly dwindled down to about one or two friends who I see very occasionally, so I've been occupying my free time by watching movies, smoking weed (which I can't do now because I ran out and can't afford more), and mostly laying around listening to music and wallowing in self-pity. I feel like my life is drifting out of control and I don't even know where to begin to fix my situation. I'm only 19 years old and yet all of my friends from high school are miles ahead of me right now. I can't even do anything creatively productive in my free time because it's impossible for me to feel inspired when I'm in a depressed state of mind and that's how I am basically 24/7 now.

The only way I can see this ending for me is offing myself, but I know I'll never do that, as much as I would like to. I'm too scared of death and wouldn't want to put my family or anybody through that. Nobody has any idea that I'm going through this. I wish I could explain to them, but I have no reason to feel this way. My first long-term girlfriend broke up with me three months ago, and yet I was doing better in the time right after that than I am now. I got prescribed escitalopram around that time too but it's either not as effective as I would like it to be or is doing weird shit to my brain chemistry because I haven't felt quite right in a while now. What I've heard about breakups is that they're supposed to be a period of self-reflection and growth, and yet I haven't done any of that at all yet. I haven't spoken with my ex since it happened but she seems to be doing quite well right now. It'd fucking kill me to let her see what's become of me. I didn't realize it at the time but she really was the only thing holding my life together. Now she's gone and I truly feel like I have nothing to live for. I felt that way while dating her, too, but at least then I could have somebody to talk to or to strive to impress. Now I have no prospects, no future, and no desire or motivation to change my situation, even though I have panic attacks almost every day now because of how fucked I know I am. I'd like to think that in ten years or so I'll be able to look back at this point in my life and see it as a low-point, but I don't know that. But there's no end in sight and there's no escaping it, either. There's nothing I can do to get my mind off of things because it's always on my mind. Even when I am doing something which should make me feel better, it doesn't because I know how much shit I have to get done and I know that by not doing it I'm just fucking myself over even more. I guess you could say I don't really have free time; it's just one long period of procrastination. This is just the trajectory of my life now. Every day is worse than the last. I've been in these sorts of positions in my life many times before, but this time I don't see any way out. The only person who can help me is me and I can't help myself because I'm a piece of shit. I don't see the point in helping myself at all, anyways, because I'm still gonna feel like this. My brain feels like it's swelling against my skull. If I kill myself I'll ask for my body to be donated to science, and maybe people who are smarter than me can look at my brain and find that it's super deformed and off-colour.

I know things will supposedly get better and I know all that ""this too shall pass"" bullshit, but my life is heading in a nasty direction and I'm not capable of fixing it. Maybe I'll just keep waiting and waiting to see what'll happen to me. I had so much going for me and I've gone and fucked it all up. Maybe that's just the way my life was supposed to go. Maybe I was just never meant to function in society. I'd like to check myself into a hospital, but I know I wouldn't want to do that because then I'd have to deal with my mom and brother and everybody and I don't want them to know I feel this way. I wish I could just completely fade away from existence, all memory of me wiped from this earth. Then the world will go on in the exact same way as it would if I were still here because, let's face it, it's not like I'm going to have much impact on anything anyway. I'll just keep being the same person I am today and continue to live my miserable existence for however long I have left in this life.

Typing all this out didn't really make me feel that much better but at least I tried. Now I'm going to go buy taquitos from 7-eleven (even though I have no money with which to afford them) and watch Smiles of a Summer Night even though it's 2:30 in the morning. If you read this whole thing for some reason, thank you. If nobody sees this post and it gets lost in the internet, good. It doesn't really matter what happens because one day all of us will be dead anyways. Jesus. Well regardless, I hope your day has gone better than mine.",0

I lost a job I loved.   
I left the man I loved and moved 900 miles away.   
I left the home I created for myself and had lived in for nearly three years.   
I left the only real support system I've ever had.   
I was 17 when I left ""home."" I had done it all on my own. Supported myself, supported my dogs, supported my chosen family when I needed too. I did it all. Alone. The last five years, I have worked my ass off to make sure I was well taken care of mentally and physically. 

Now, I am alone. 900 miles away from everyone, living in a house full of people who are literally about to drive me bat-shit crazy. 

I feel like I'm drowning. Drowning in debt, fear, and constant anxiety. 

I don't want to do this anymore. I don't want to do anything anymore. I just want to sleep.   


And to top it all off, I have my parents breathing down my back over every little thing.   
""You didn't clean this dish the right way.""  
""You don't help enough around the house.""  
""You don't act like you want to be here.""  
""You're acting very selfish.""  
""You have double standards.""  
""You don't have your priorities in check.""   
""You don't do enough for your dogs.""   
""You're late on your rent.""  
""You could get a better job.""  
""You are becoming a problem here.""  


For the love of all things holy, shut the fuck up. 

Leave me alone. Stop. I can't fucking breathe. I feel like I'm suffocating.

348,"I am unsure of whether I have depression or not. I've been struggling with my mental health for, at least, the last three years. However I only managed to get myself to start going to a psychologist a few months ago. I thought I was doing better: I'm finally talking about it... 

But lately it actually feels like it's getting worse. It's the morning and I'm already feeling a pain in my chest and crying in my room. Normally it only hits me like that at night and not everyday. I notice myself drifting off conversations when I am with friends and acquaintances; I can't really bond anymore. At work I'm a mess, not being productive and not making any improvements. The headaches are getting worse, it's like being hungover without having had a single drink. I know sports or meditation would be good  for me, but I can't get myself to do it consistently. 

I don't see the end of it. I was happy to at least had make the first step of going to a psychologist. But it doesn't feel that helpful and now she has referred me to another practice. They won't see me until June. It's been so long since I had not been feeling ok, and yet the idea of not going to even be able to strive for getting better until June is killing me. And I know even then it's not going to change from one day to another. I don't have self-harm thoughts, but I can't imagine living like this two more months, knowing I'm making no progress, feeling like it's getting worse.

I wanted to post this to ask for tips, or encouragement or anything. I know there's people who are stronger and getting on with much worse circumstances. I want to know how you do it. How do you keep going when you see no end? How can I get out of this mindset? Then I've actually read the rules and realized that maybe this is not the place to ask for tips, just support. That's already good for me. Simply writing this already helped. Only a bit, but it's something.",0
349,"At this point in my life after losing the girl I thought I was going to marry to a good friend of mine, losing a lot of friends even after trying to reconnect, having no family to turn to really because we aren’t on good terms. The absolute last person I could go to is my now ex-girlfriend but she’s tired of dealing with me. My absolute last hope is tired of dealing with my depression and I’ve never felt so annoying to someone who cared/possibly still cares about whether I’m alive or dead. Why should I keep going? I have almost nobody to talk to, even on my good days something always goes terribly wrong and brings me down immediately. 

It’s just getting to the point where I feel not a single person cares about my well being or how I’m doing. They just see the fake smile I put on while on the inside I’ve never been more dead, emotionless, lack of any happiness whatsoever. I hurt myself for a couple weeks but the pain was temporary and just wasn’t enough. I don’t understand why at 21 I feel like my life has already had its run of good times in the 6 years I had with her, full of laughter, meeting new people who became great friends that faded out along with my ex. Her family that became my new family because they knew where I stood with mine and were always so welcoming. 

I just feel like my time is running out and I’d do anything for someone or something to pull me out of this. I just want to feel happy again and have that stay even though I know with my luck all good things come to an end. It feels like I think about me dying in some way, shape or form a hundred times a day. Whether it be an accident on the way to or home from work, someone taking my life, natural causes, or taking my own life. I hate waking up everyday with no purpose or reason to be happy, waking up to notifications on my phone only from people wanting to keep the stupid snap streak then never replying to anything I send for the rest of the day just trying to talk and keep my mind off of killing myself. 

I realize more and more as the days go by that nobody gives a single fuck about how I’m doing. Not a single person bothers to ask, check up on me or anything especially with what’s been going on (break up). I’ve already attempted to overdose multiple times but I just wake up disappointed or get no sleep at all and head straight to work that morning. I made a lot of promises to people including my ex that I wouldn’t kill myself, the only reason I promised her was because I helped her through some really dark times also so it’s only fair, but I just simply don’t want to live up to the promises let alone live in general. As soon as you make that promise everyone just assumes “they’ll be okay now, they promised” and forgets about all of your problems and just goes on with life. If that’s how it’s always going to be then why in the hell should I keep going? What is the point if my life has been nothing but sad and depressing for as long as I can remember",0

352,"Throw away for obvious reasons.
My best friend of 3 years had asked me to hang out earlier today, but I refused since I was busy with preparing for my moms birthday and I honestly wasn’t in the mood to be around people. A few hours later I received a casual text from her asking me what to do when you overdose on antidepressants and your head is spinning.
I was obviously panicked and scared, so I told her to call her mom immediately and in the mean time drink as much water as she could. (We’re both minors and I can’t drive yet, so I couldn’t go to her house myself.)
A few minutes later I texted her again asking if she called and she said she didn’t. Her parents aren’t as caring as most but I was obviously frustrated and anxious. I snapped at her to call and she said she would. I haven’t heard from her since. This all happened around 20 minutes ago, and I can’t call the police because I don’t want her to get scared (she’s had bad interactions with the police in the past and doesn’t trust them.)
I really don’t know what to do anymore. I can’t lose her, she’s probably the best person I’ve ever been friends with. I had to tell someone. I feel terrible, is there anything you guys can do to help? Should I be mad? Should I tell her it’s okay? Any input would help a lot.",0

More examples of thoughts I have are ""my voice sounds so weird"" or ""where should I look"" (when I'm speaking to my friends) or ""am i talking too much/too little right now?"". When I'm sober, I describe myself as a relatively quiet person, but can still have decent conversations with co-workers, family, friends, etc. But I do also worry from time to time and also am quite sad most of the time.

354,"For as long as I can remember I’ve always been alone. I was an only child, maybe that explains it, I don’t know. But I’ve never been able to maintain friendships. I’d start talking to someone and we’d seem to get along but the friendship would either fizzle out or they’d never talk to me again, even if I tried to keep in touch. And as I’ve gotten older it’s only gotten worse. During college there were days where I wouldn’t talk to a single person. Even online, I can’t make friends and it hurts. I see other people with significant others, friends, and/or family, and all it does is make me realize I have nothing and no one. I have no support whatsoever... I feel like I have the weight of the world on my shoulders all the fucking time. And I know I shouldn’t be putting this burden on others, but I’m just tired. Not just physically, but also on the inside. My soul feels tired. I have become almost afraid of other people because I’m wary of their intentions... the few times I did put myself out there to try to connect with someone I found other people to be very unkind and not at all understanding. I just... I don’t know. Maybe some people were meant to be alone... but I’m not prepared for it. I don’t think I can handle the rest of my life being like this.

I'm a full time college student with a part time job and a long distance boyfriend. I bring each of these up because they're all the biggest parts of my life. For the past possibly 6 months or so, I have felt like there is just NOTHING good going on in my life. And it's not that things are terrible or miserable, but there's such an absence of good that it's enough to drive me insane. It's the absence of good that's nagging at me more and more each day. I feel like I'm always on the verge of tears and that any little road bump thrown at me will trigger me to bawl my eyes out. I mean, I'm a pretty sensitive person so that's also a factor. I also struggle with anxiety.

Let's talk about school: I currently go to a shitty community college and I'm a psychology major taking 17 units. Prior to this, I majored in dance but I've come to realize that psychology is a better career choice for my introverted personality as I'd like to work more ""behind the scenes"" in research rather than own a dance studio and teach dance, which is obviously working heavily with the public. I'm getting pretty fed up with this school because I don't feel like I belong: I feel so much more ambitious and ready to get to the next step of my life, aka university. This is okay though, because I am transferring in the fall to San Diego State. So I know I have something to look forward to, but dragging myself through the now is proving to be more and more difficult. My psychology classes aren't really challenging or super specific to what I want to pursue yet, so I'm bored in class. Along with this, I STUPIDLY thought it would be fun to tack on some dance obligations at school. So I'm stuck in this boring mediocre belly dancing class because it was the only thing that worked with my schedule and I must have at least one dance class in order to perform in the dance concert, which the dance concert is proving to be overwhelming and essentially turned out to feel like such an obligation rather than something enjoyable. But I can't drop out of these now without my grades being affected. Go figure. I was so excited to show up for my classes last semester but it isn't the same this time around.

About work: I work 16 hours a week at what should be a pretty low-stress laid back job for the library headquarters in my county. Tasks consist of pulling big tubs of supplies off shelves and making sure they're sent out to library branches, along with taking inventory of these supplies upon return. Additional projects throughout the year. However, my manager is a nut case. She makes what should be a low key job into the most stressful depressing mess it could possibly be. Whenever she tells me to do something, she says it with such condescending attitude and tells me ""the pressure is on."" After I complete a task, I apparently can't do anything right by her standards because she always gets visibly angry with me and tells me what I did wrong in an incredibly not-constructive-criticism type way, mostly just a barking at me because I messed something up for her. She blames me for what her boss might say to HER for a mistake I made that could've been avoided had she given me more thorough instruction. She inappropriately shows her anger at work. I spend a lot of my days incredibly depressed and anxious at work, even on days where I'm not working. I feel like I'm walking on eggshells with this manager and my heart is constantly pounding whenever I hear her footsteps coming into the room. I've been searching pretty hard for a new job but dealing with interviews (which usually end up being a flop) only makes me more overwhelmed having to incorporate them into my schedule. And forget trying to find jobs that actually relate to my career path, as I have no research or lab experience in psychology. I'm stuck applying to admin assistant jobs for a while. Between work and school I have no other time or sanity to tack on additional unpaid internships or volunteering in order to gain relevant experience, so I am also stuck in that regard. I'm sick of having to put up with irrelevant mediocre jobs just to pay my bills because they are truly a distraction from my studies and disable me from building more relevant experience through volunteer means. This aspect of my life upsets me THE MOST and I am highly considering living off student loans next year and quitting these stupid ass jobs because they affect my mental health so bad. 

&amp;#x200B;

About my relationship: this is the only truly 100% healthy, positive, encouraging, exciting aspect in my life right now. Aside from wanting to achieve a good career one day, my relationship is what keeps me going and I don't know what I would do if I didn't have this great source of happiness in my life right now. My boyfriend is stationed in Japan (navy) and I am in California. We are working through this incredibly well. I've visited Japan in October, I've visited him and his family in Illinois in January, and he is coming back out to San Diego to see me in June. This is a light at the end of the tunnel for me like no other right now. I am motivated to graduate a year early for the purposes of lining my graduation up with him getting out of the navy so we can finally close the distance and live together (also to possibly take a gap year and REALLY focus on honing my research experience for grad school). Basically, this relationship is helping me better crystallize the outlook of my future and my plans and it helps me tremendously from a mental health standpoint. 

&amp;#x200B;

I feel that my experience with depression is unique in that I don't feel like all hope is lost. I do feel highly motivated and ambitious about the future. But ONLY about the future. It's the RIGHT NOW that's fucking killing me to get through. Sometimes it's so bad that it overshadows all the good there is to look forward to about the future. I struggle immensely to get through each day, let alone each week. Every time Monday rolls around I want to cry and I feel almost numb at the same time, as if I'm just so fucking fed up with doing this routine. I realize that almost all of my time is spent feeling like shit because it's spent doing nothing I enjoy, rather only doing things I have to do. I don't have the time or energy for hobbies to find happiness in and nor do I have much of an interest in hobbies anymore anyway. I'm at a loss for how to fix my current situation. I find myself completely consumed by the future because it's the only good thing I have to keep me moving forward. Other than that, I have NO idea how to cope with this. I feel like the only way my life will improve is if I can somehow quit having to work and have time and energy to do things I enjoy or to do activities that will better my future. ",0

I don’t even wanna get up to do any of things I have time to actually accomplish. I can’t even read a book I really wanted to finish.

357,"I am 21 years old and I have never had a job, a boyfriend or a friend really. I haven't attended college yet either.

I know I can change things around if I truly want to, there's a part of me pulling towards a greater future and another part that desperately wants to cling onto my lame predictable life. I'm terrified of driving or maybe I'm terrified of the independence that driving would provide me. I feel so disconnected from other people my age.

358,"Don't bother making responses, in fact don't respond at all, all I am doing is monologueing. Venting. 

Ever since I was young, I've always had a tendancy for negativity. Whether it be always being on guard around others, having to feel like I need to put on a front, or to simply outright lying about even the most miniscule things all in an attempt to not be hated, not be scorned upon, not be seen as different. I was and am always afraid of what others think of me. I just don't want to be different. I keep people at a distance and put on a facade. I play relationships but the truth is I yearn for human connection so much but I am deathly afraid of it none the less. I crave something genuine and worthwhile.  

I suppose due to my constant facades, lies and fears I developed a strong sense of understanding of how others felt, and am quite adept at deconstructing others thoughts and feelings. I'm good at reading people. I'm good at understanding people. I've spent long hours just thinking. Thinking about the most mundane and useless things. I am good at getting people, including myself. I guess that's why I can say is know for sure I have depression. Why the lofty, self pat on the back attitude? Well it's really an attempt to maintain want little self confidence and self worth I have so I put on a front of intellectual superiority. At least byself to myself. There are many people who are depressed, that's obvious. I'm not any different, nor am I special. But when I say I'm depressed, I'm not clinically depressed. I am a self diagnosed depressed person. That's right I'm just a self diagnosed shitbag. 

The first time I thought of suicide, or at the very least the first time I remember of wanting to end my own life, was grade 3. Why was it, I don't even remember, all I know it was for some stupid and idiotic reason. But I guess the simple act of thinking of suicide at that age is a indicator of my mental health being less than desirable. Ever since I was young I put on a facade of social and academic success. I got good grades, maintained a good social standing amount my peers and acted in accordance to how the adults expected me to behave, I was quiet, attentive and a ""good kid."" It was all a lie. I may have got good grades but I felt no desire to pursue education. I had fun with friends but I could never truly call them friends, they were strangers I spent time with for long periods of time. I was incredibly lonely and sad. I spent all my time just being weak. Are like a pig. Lazier than a pig. And a lustful sack of shit. But I guess that's all boys at that age, eh? But I felt less than, I felt weak being so pitiful. No drive, so ambition, no nothing. I did well in school but for what? But I still continued with my facade of excellency. It wasn't like I didn't have fun, but at the end of the day j felt so empty and alone. 

Highschool. I kept up the facade. Good grades. Good friends. I should be happy. But I'm not. I continue this until grade 11, when I failed my first test. I attributed that failure to reasons such as it's a hard class, or the teacher is shit, or I'm lazy, or it's a combo of all those. In retrospect it was an early indication that I couldn't fend off the dark thoughts on my head any longer. I've always had passive suicidal thoughts. Just what ifs and maybes and long silent and tiring thoughts in my head. But I kept them locked up. I kept them on a leash. But The mental blockades I so meticulously constructed were crumbling. My grades startied slipping. I was becoming more and more reclusive. I was becoming more and more pathetic. In grade 12, my average was, well average, and as a result, was rejected by the university I was supposed to attend. Not like it mattered because I was not in a mindset I could attend post secondary education and not feel like jumping off a building with mind numbing sensation of just epmtyness I felt at times. Although the act of finding out I was rejected was in of itself another reason, a harsher reason I wanted death. It was numbing nothing felt real. I felt like an outsider in my own body. Depersonalization is what they call it. Not like it happened often, but enough I knew it's not normal. I'm now repeating a year in order to make of for my poor grades. Have a ok average but only because I cheat like a bitch. Something I never would have dreamed of a simple 4 years prior, hell 2 years even. And it's not like I feel this way Al the time. I laugh, I get angry, but I am immediately reminded of how little I am worth in every action I take. 

From New years of this year to about the end of March. That passive suicidal ideation turned aggressive. Thoughts of suicide every single day, of every single hour I'm awake and aware. Cursing my time I had to be awake. Engaging in dangerous behavior like rough driving. Mind numbing terror. Pure terror and fear of just being alive. Aggravated, violently soul crushing suicidal thoughrs. It hurt to be conscious. To think. So much guilt, so much anxiety so much disappointment and dissatisfaction of myself. Last week of March I planned to end it but chickened out because I am scared of death. thought to myself ""Ah, so I'm just gonna have to live with this insanity now aren't I? Well I guess so."" And put those thoughts of ending my life on the shelf, sitting there collecting dust until that day I may need it again. When I need it again. 

No one suspects any sort of this behaviour of me. Although I have cut off all of my friends for the most part, delete almost all social media last year, only retaining some apps for the bare minimum amount of social interaction needed to not tip anyone off of my poor mental state. Though some people did reach out and ask how I was doing. I lie and tell em I'm ok, but I'm not. But I feel anger. Frustrating. Disgust, when they ask me whats wrong. Why are you asking me this? Do I seem weak? Am I weak? Why are you wasting your time on me? Why? Why? Why? I feel disgusting when someone wants to help me. I feel less than. I feel weak. To me help is something I give to others but am not suppose to receive myself. I'm not worthy of that kindness. I'm a less than? I as a man am not allowed to be depressed. I don't want to be pitied. I do think want to be treated differently. I'm scared. So incredibly scared. Of the future, of getting help, the next day, the day itself. 

What would warrant such negitive and depressive thinking? I have a few ideas, long winded explainations, but ones that hold true and would need seperate posts of their own. A few. My home life is good, it has its ups and downs but I can't complain, or at the very least don't complain about its downs when they happen. I've never been bullied, thank god or else I may have end it long long ago. Again, good grades and social life. I don't have, or ever had a girlfriend, but am in no way resentful of that. I don't think I am worthy of one, in consideration of my poor physique and destructive personality. I'm not partner material, and rightfully so. Something's just wrong with me, that's why I feel this way. 

That's where the plan comes in. Sometime grade 10 I decided to pursue physiology. I plan to study the brain and why it's so retarded and attempt to fix myself. It's a dumb dumb idea I know but I have nothing else. I have no ambition or drive. I have no feasible dreams (my ultimate dream would be to have a beautiful wife and cute kid working a stable job that helps others but A) that's cringe and not something a 18m would want. B) it implies I am worth/deserve either/or and C) I am not responsible enough for a wife and kid, I'm too dumb) and so I choose phycology blah blah blah fix myself. Although, I still cheat, which is the only reason for my good grades at the moment. 

I know I need proper medical attention. I know I need to be formally diagnosed. I know I need to open up about all this. But I am a coward, I can't fathom the ideology of.trusting.someone enough I can be vulnerable to them. I know my parents can't afford the price tag that comes with severe depression. I plan to seek aid if and only if I become self sustaining and can purchase the meds myself, as to not notify others of how terrible and weak I feel. 

All in all, I just don't know. 

I stopped watching porn since I just don't feel comfortable with it, i find it disgusting and I haven't gotten properly hard in 2 years. I eat once a day or only junk food. I sleep alot less. Wake up very early in the morningand just lay in bed frozen with fear.  Tired all the time. I submerge myself in videogames, YouTube, Reddit. I cut off most of my friends. What little left I have now. I listen to music and feel bad about myself. I do nothing productive. I just waste away. I. make comments on Reddit to stack up imaginary internet points, I eat out more than ever skip class like there's no tomorrow. I'm just as self indulgent and pathetic as before. Nothing's changes. I try to, but it seems like all I have is a dull, grey, tomorrow. Although that in of itself is a nice thought of its own. The future I envision is a one bedroom apartment, single, no spouse or kids, stable medium income job, beat up car, money in the back, few items because I'm not materialistic, work alone, eat alone, sleep alone, die alone. Work is something to help others. Contribute to society in someway and just stay away from others. I just be an outsider. I stay away from others. I stay alone. 

In the end, idk. I don't want death, k just don't want to feel this way, wanna be happy. Thing is, the only way I feel that is in death. But idk. I just don't know.  ",0
359,"I've had a serious break with my family today and I'm all alone tonight, wondering why I have no-one in my life who can comfort me. Wondering why I was begging for my family to just hear my side and have some sympathy for me and all i got was told how evil I am.

Does anyone else ever keep tabs on your actions during the day as evidence that you're really a nice person? I've been told I'm horrible so often that i find myself doing that just so I can believe I'm not the monster they make me out to be.


Lke if I pet my rabbit and feed him real well and he's clearly happy, I'll think I cannot be a monster if he shows me affection right? Or sometimes if I do some random thing like give money to a homeless person or help out a co-worker, in the back of my mind I'll think - ok, this means I'm not a beast. I'm actually human right?



Cause I haven't been treated like a human being by my family in so long and now I'm alone and I just feel awful. Like maybe it was all my fault and I'm horrible and monstrous and that's why thy don't care what they say to me. Even when i'm begging for understanding. Just a little sympathy and understanding.

365,"I would like to clarify that I have been to therapists and certain groups to help cope with my mental condition. 

But I used to have a fantastic group of friends that I considered best of friends. Due to my self loathing and addiction I selfishly destroyed all trust I had with these people. After my first 2 or so years in college I lost touch with most of these friends. As recent as a year ago I met up with some of them but it felt out of place as I was out of their lives and couldn't relate to anything. So I ghosted and isolated myself went back down my rabbit hole battled my own demons since then. There is a certain intimacy of trust between friends that family or a therapist can't replicate. It's been a couple of years since I spoke to most of these individuals since we used to be a group. I have this unrelenting feeling that probably some of you on this sub can relate to; that feeling that everyone hates you.

 I honestly just want to reach out and try to rekindle that relationship with them. Not only for myself and my quality of life, but I don't think I could live this isolated lifestyle anymore. I can't even sleep somedays, my peace of mind is at a crossroads; and I think the lack of friends to speak to contributes to my mental state and depression. I don't feel comfortable sharing my depression with others, often time it's hard for people who don't suffer to understand what you are going through. I don't think they understand my mental state, and I'm not to good with opening up to people.

I'm curious if anyone else was in a similar situation or have advice on reaching out to friends/family that you lost touch with.

TL;DR : Reaching out to a group of friends that you haven't spoken to in awhile due to lost of touch/conflict. Depression and loneliness is something I have suffered for quite sometime now. I haven't spoken to most of these friends in around 3-4 years. Don't know where to even start. ",0
366,"Background:

Chronic, severe depression, GAD, PTSD, bulimia- shit sucks, I know you know.

The past two years, my depression has worsened drastically, and to prevent giving in to the symptoms, I throw myself into my work- it's with kids at a gov-funded non-profit, so it's super healing in some ways, but the 11 hour days, no time off, and lack of managerial support is really hard. The structured time forced me to keep going for the kids' sake, but on weekends I just collapse, cry, isolate, disassociate, and wish I was dead. 

The symptoms are so bad now that they're hard to hide at work, and I recently called in sick on three days when I knew my absence wouldn't negatively impact other people. I told my manager I could get notes from a doctor and present proof of disability and illness to HR no problem, but that illness was something impacting my wellfare in a big way and I'd try my best to fulfill my contact and do right by the kids we serve. I did not tell him what was ailing me.

My manager was immediately sympathetic, and even asked how he could help me day to day if there were reasonable accommodations he could make for the remainder of my contact. All in all, it was really cool of him and I was hopeful that I could finally manage my health and serve my students. 

This past week he requested that I tell him my symptoms so that he could better help me, and that he needed to know what I was sick with so he could ""better understand my pattern of absence"".

I could tell he was serious, and in fear of making him more suspicious by not telling him, I divulged a lot. I regretted it all the moment I said it. He could've asked me to present medical notes to HR for days he was suspicious of, or asked ""how can I help you"" without requiring symptoms. I feel taken advantage of, and so, so vulnerable. I don't know what to do, but I feel sick that I said anything, and sick thinking about seeing him again. If he harbored any understanding of this stuff he never would've asked that of me.

Has anyone experienced anything like this? Was I coerced or just stupid? Any advice is appreciated.

367,"I don’t know if this is the right subreddit so if anyone knows it’s wrong pls do inform me:) 

I haven’t been diagnosed by a psychiatrist because there is high stigma about mental illness in my country (especially since I’m a medstudent, a lot worse since I’m supposed to be treating people myself) so this is all from what I’ve learnt and secondary research. 

I have mostly no problem meeting my obligations (ie doing my work, going to school, doing laundry etc) but sometimes I shut down and all I want to do is lie in bed for like half a day before I can drag myself back up. There are some happy days but sometimes I feel super lonely and empty. I crack suicide jokes to hide the reality that I wouldn’t mind dying just to end this madness. And mostly they are well received Beca use I use a really light hearted tone and laugh afterwards. 

I have friends, but a lot of times I feel like they don’t care. , and I could call them crying and they would just hit me with ‘oof’ and continue with their lives.  The only few real friends I feel truly cares are all out of the country (I used to study overseas) and we have time difference and our own lives to live. 

My parents pushed me into med school and are paying for it, so I can’t exactly say that they don’t care, but then I can’t help feeling that they only love me that I’m in medschool and this bring prestige to the family (yes I’m Asian. ) 
The minute I fail out they’re probably going to disown me and I wish I was joking.

Sometimes I wish I felt more strongly, that I was seriously depressed enough to having thoughts of suicide, because then I’d feel the drive to do something to fix the state I am in.

373,"Until recently, I wasn't able to pinpoint the start of my depression. I knew it was in early childhood when I started to have crushing sadness for seemingly no reason, without a huge life event to spark those feelings. Yesterday I was at a memorial for a family member when all my immediate family were all sitting toegther for the first time in years, maybe 10 or so. Somehow my childhood characteristics came up and everyone commented on how loud and full of energy I was, and how I've changed so much. My aunt talked about how much my mom complained about my rambunctiousness a as a kid and adolescent, and then went on to talk about how horrible of a drunk I used to be (none of my family drinks, which is good for them but im not there yet, plus I haven't been drunk or felt like I've had an issue with alcohol in years (I'm 26 now). My only sibling i grew up with (7 years older) told a story about how I complained once at a family dinner when I was 8 or 9 that we didn't talk enough as a family or spend enough time together by saying ""well in 7th heaven the family talks to each other during meals"" to which she replied ""well life isn't a fucking tv show"". Everyone laughed and she actually apologised to me yesterday for being so rude to me when we were kids. I got this horrible feeling that I haven't had in a long time, the belittled, worthless  despair I had as a kid when my parents told me to shut up or that I was too ambitious and to suck it up and face reality. Though that built a good work ethic, I realized that the numb depression ive had for years started when i was a kid, feeling like i needed to be quiet like my family. My parents didn't sleep in the same bed, they have no friends, and we never did anything as a family except sometimes eat together in silence. I thought this was normal, and my self doubt started when I was younger when being put down for being ""too energetic"" when looking back now, I was just a fucking kid! I can't blame my family for eveything, I understand that my choices have also shaped my life and only I can make myself happy. Yesterday just made me want to tell my entire family to fuck off and never speak to them again. I know that's selfish, but I want to get back to being that energetic person I was at 7 years old who thinks they can do anything, and no one can tell me to shut up.

Until just over a year ago I had a healthy social life, friends, and had just started to become a more confident and outgoing person. then all of the sudden my parents decided it would be a great idea to move to a new state last March. I hated it. I secretly hated them for it. But I tried to make the best of it. It's been over a year now. I still have no friends here. The only people I care about (which is a kinda short list) all are spread throughout the USA. I have no motivation to to do anything.

Now to clear I'm not feeling suicidal I never have when I'm depressed. It's something I can't do to those around me. 

But to get back on point I'm losing interest in anything I enjoy. I use to when I was young (I'm 23 now)play video games all hours of the night. I'd play modern warfare 2 and blast Eminem's the show album. Never once during that time did I lose interest. I met some good friends my age because of that. But as I got older I just lost the passion for it. The thought keeps coming up of ""what do I get out of this when I'm done?"" Or ""what's the point?"". I try and look for the value of what I get out if it. Or the thought of even if I get a slight bit of excitement it's crushed not too long after without fail. Good example is the new borderlands game will be released first on PC and held off from consoles for a couple of months. 

Also I've suffered a lose 2 years ago that didn't help anything. Fell in love with this girl and for once in my life I felt alive and happy. I wanted to greet the day and make a difference in people's lives. But we found out she had stomach cancer. She went through the treatments (not once did I think I need to leave. I stayed cause I loved her) and she beat it but had to have surgery to have it removed so it wouldn't cause problems. The day she went into surgery she had a seizure on the table and they knicked an artery in her stomach. She bled out and passed (she had other health issues) 

That destroyed me as a person. That seems to be the constantly recurring theme of as soon as something good happens it's destroyed right in front of me. Now cause of that I just lay in bed and sleep. That's all I do anymore. I mean I think ""I wish I could do this"" or ""if I only had the ability to"". Even if I muster up enough energy to I watch twitch or YouTube. When I do I just hope and wish I could have fun like that again. I wish I could surround myself in that world again and for once smile genuinely again. 

My only other thing is I look up reviews for things that I'm interested in or for a game I like. I see some good then others that are just horrible and point out all the terrible things and that's all I can think about then. I rethink about buying that thing and just wonder ""is it worth it?""

386,"I really miss the big parrot I used to work with. He was a really young but fully grown Red Lored Parrot. I'm crying like a little bitch right now just thinking about him. None of us could ever agree on a name, but I always called him ""Nova"". He was a fucking asshole when he first arrived. first day he bit just above my nail but still low enough to crack straight through it. He didn't like anyone and hated any interaction with people. I absolutely love animals, especially birds and reptiles, so I didn't let his bites discourage me.

&amp;#x200B;

Over the next few works I obtained a lot of deep bites, ear piercing screams, and he even stole then broke my favorite pen. I was more persistent with him than any of my own animals. It took awhile, but I was finally able to have him step up onto my hand from out of his cage. A lot of birds are cage aggressive so being able to do this with such a large bird with so much stimulation every day was amazing. He would take treats right from my fingers so gently. He was starting to mimic the parakeets and was even getting the hang of a short tune I'd whistle.

&amp;#x200B;

Then one day my coworker, Cheyenne, came up to us and said ""You know it's going to be hard on both of you when he leaves. You two are going to get too bonded that each of you is going to be really really depressed when you have to get separated."" I knew she was right. I just never wanted to think about it. I didn't have the $1700 for him plus the entire set up, but I was honestly thinking about selling one of my cars for him. I had the space, I sure as fuck had the time for him, I just kept hoping he wouldn't go.

&amp;#x200B;

One morning I woke up and everything was just going so wrong. I had a bad night, i got very little sleep, I felt too sick to eat breakfast, I was late to work, and it wasn't even 9am yet.  I finally clocked in and was already starting to feel better knowing I would get to spend the next 3-5 hours with Nova. I practically ran across the store out of excitement to my department only to be stopped dead in my tracks. He was gone...

&amp;#x200B;

""I had just worked yesterday....did he really sell in the few hours I was gone? Why didn't any of my coworkers let me know...?"" I was heartbroken. This was the bird that I spent 5-6 days with a week with. For fucks sake I would even come in on my days off to talk with him and walk him around. He actually *wanted* to leave his cage when he saw me. He would always try to fly to *me* no matter who was holding him. I checked the sales log and he went only an hour after i clocked out yesterday. I walked out back to the warehouse and honestly started crying. I knew it was only a matter of time, but god damn it still hurt.

&amp;#x200B;

I pulled myself together and went about doing my opening routine when I found the bag of papaya treats and sunflower seeds he loved. I had to try so many different things and suffer so many bites just to find his favorite snack. The store was open and customers were starting to come in, but I could feel my eyes sting. I looked over at his big empty cage and couldn't control myself. I started tearing up again.

&amp;#x200B;

A few hours later Cheyenne comes in to work. She sees that Nova is gone and immediately knew how I was feeling. She tried to comfort me, but nothing could really help in that moment. It was one of my worst shifts I have ever had to work. All because of a single, 1 pound, feathery, screeching, bird.

&amp;#x200B;

I never got to seem him again. I still look at the pictures and videos of him on my phone once in a while. I know he wasn't with me long, but it felt like years.

It feels like my thoughts constantly revolve around the fact that I'm single and I have a hard time accepting that.

395,"For the past several weeks, I've had multiple moments where I should be happy for myself, but I have this insane inferiority complex that seems to ruin any positivity. 

I recently got a job as a nurse in an ICU. I'll be starting after my graduation from school. It's the job I've wanted since almost the beginning of nursing school, however I keep on playing out scenarios where I screw something up, or the severity of the patients gets the better of me, and I lose the job. My dream. 

I also recently started to rekindle a relationship with a girl who I love very much. We dated for a year and half before splitting up for a couple of months and now we're trying it again after a long discussion about what both of us need to compromise on, and how we picture ourselves growing together. The two of us are actually doing well on rectifying the big issues we had, and on paper, things should be going very well. However, each night when I drive home from her house, I break down sobbing literally saying out loud ""You are a fucking loser, dude."" Each night I convince myself that I blew it today, and that she's no longer interested. I'm not sure the extent of how irrational this is, but part of me can tell that shes getting tired of explaining her love for me. She's nearly spelling out her feelings for me and I. Just. Cant. Buy. It. 

I used to think that my lack of a cohesive and tight group friends is due to the city I live in, or the lack of time I have between full time school and a job, or the fact that I didnt go the conventional route at 18 and stay in the dorms. 

It's all bullshit, pathetic excuses. 

I think the reason I dont have any friends is because I have this nearly debilitating, ""stiff board"" creating anxiety when it comes to meeting and hanging out with people that I could see myself enjoying being around. I'm horrified to address that. I have NO motivation to reach out to the few acquaintances I have, and sometimes seem cold by walling myself off. 

I'm writing this because I'm sick of the self loathing, the anxiety, the fear of celebrating something too early. It's time to make a change, and it's time to get help.

I’ve been dealing with family dying and fighting and it’s taken a toll on me. Is he going to leave me at this point..? He won’t talk to me about his feelings anymore.

406,"I don't know what I'm doing when I spend time with people. I don't know what to say and often have nothing to say, but then that just makes me aware of the awkwardness and boredom and silence of the moment. The awkwardness makes me zone out, and tbh I'm almost always zoning out. The present moment hardly ever interests me and I always end up back in my head somehow.

Socializing and connecting with others has become impossible. Im boring. I have no idea what aspect of life I would enjoy other than sleep. I never have jokes to say. I feel like I'm interviewing people. I talk to them while I'm zoned out. I don't look them in the eye out of fear of them seeing just how little I care about the conversation. Or so that they don't see my as creepy when I zone out and just passive spectate them kinda. I feel like a robot when I'm talking to people, just completely absent and going through casual speech.

Jokes make me laugh and enjoy life, but I never seem to be able to come up with anything myself except stupid low quality dad jokes sometimes. Other than that I'm just zoned out and ""not here"" I laugh at what other people say often, but I'm so zoned out that I often can't think of anything to say back. It makes me jealous of funny people, because being funny is the metric I use to judge whether or not someone is having a good time in their conversation with me. That's also slightly a projection because I never seem to enjoy any conversation unless it makes me laugh. Conversations about anything else just seem empty.",0

408,"My SO and I were visiting a friend in an apartment that we both use to live before we moved. We were starting to leave and then got stopped by the landlady. She was so excited to see my SO since it has been awhile since she last saw him. Talked up a storm. We never officially met before but seen each other around. 

She turned to me and said so you’re the girl that he was so worried about? SO and I were so taken back for a minute. I was speechless. Nothing was coming out of my mouth so I just smiled and nodded. 

Last year. I was not in a great place. I was depressed and suicidal. One night. I was done. I told my SO I am sorry and that it wasn’t his fault. I packed everything up so it would be easier for him after I was gone. And I wrote a letter. He was freaking out because he was a half hour away working on the car and couldn’t go anywhere. He also didn’t know where I was since I stopped replying to him. He broke down and finally called the police. And then called his landlady to let the police in if they couldn’t get in. 

The police showed up and talked to me. That police officer had saved my life. He took me to the hospital to get admitted and checked out. I stayed there for the night then got discharged. SO picked me up. And we talked about it then moved on. 

That night was not a good night or memory for us. It was a distant memory. Everything has gotten better for the both of us and I am now in a better place now. 

When she said “so you’re the girl that he was so worried about?” It made both of us speechless. 

I am trying to let not ruin my day but that cut deeper than I thought but like I said to SO give me time and I’ll be okay. I’m taking the hit and rolling through it. 

Sorry for rambling on but just wanted to get it off my chest. Thank you for reading this far. 

TLDR: Had a bad night, moved on and forgot about it. Was reminded about it today and it took me back.

I’m living but I don’t really feel alive. I don’t want to kill myself but I don’t wanna be be here. I wanna sleep and never wake up, my dreams are better than reality. 

Also, all I have are nightmares and in those, I lose the ones I care most about because I push them so far away from me that they’ll never find a way back. 

And in addition to that, I just pretend to be happy so that nobody questions me anymore, nobody can help, nobody but me, but I don’t care, not anymore, not again. Like, every time I rebuild myself, everything just crumbles and I’m back in the same place I was before, empty and depressed.",0

From time to time I get hit hard and it makes it difficult for me to be social. I understand this and bare through the dark times knowing the good will come again if I'm patient.

I have opened up with my girlfriend about this, I am usually very very secretive about it (first time posting online aswel). The issue is she doesn't understand that my lack of communication isn't an attack on her it's simply the best way I've learned to cope. I like to compare it to riding out a bad high.

When I am in these low states she turns it into a conflict, stating I'm just making it worse or that I am mad at her in particular. All in all she turns it into an issue about us even thou it's the farthest thing from the truth. Our relationship is great and I love her very deeply, most times in a state of conflict we can talk...but when I'm depressed I don't think the clearest and I'm scared that this will be the end of our relationship. I've explained this to her but she just can't seem to grasp that I need my space and it's not her.

I'm curious if anyone has been in this situation, and what have you done to help it?

417,"Just another post. I just need to vent because I have nobody to talk to. Everyone I've tried to reach out to about my depression have taken steps away from me and now don't associate with me unless they are forced.

&amp;#x200B;

I told him I'd try again for another 6 months. He doesn't want to responsible if something happens to me but he also doesn't want to take on the responsibility that is my happiness of well being. I don't blame him, its a big responsibility. He is my world and I wish I was his. I know I'm not, its why he doesn't tell me he loves me, rarely show affection and hasn't been intimate with me for over 2 years. I live with him and his family, they adore me and give me the illusion that I have the happy family I dream of every day. 

&amp;#x200B;

I need to cry less, I need to be able to operate on my own, I need to have my own life. I know that. But I become crippled with fear of being alone. I just want to feel safe, stable, loved and intimate with him but how long will it last?

&amp;#x200B;

I had such a broken childhood with a lot of physical and mental abuse, it made me the emotional and mentally unstable person I am today. I have been depressed, anxious, no self esteem and suicidal since middle school with intermittent improvements that just spiral back down when shit hits the fan. Nothing in my life has gone the way I wanted, People come into my life only to leave it and forget about me. Fear of abandonment makes me an anxious wreck and I always wonder what I did to deserve this. I am a genuine and nice person. I do my best to make sure others don't feel the pain that I go through. I'd never wish this pain upon anyone else. I work as a nurse and I make an effort to make my patients feel appreciated. All of my patients love me (except one crazy patient). It's not real love, at most I am a positive entity in their revolving lives.

&amp;#x200B;

I am 29 years old and exhausted from emotional pain and constant anxiety. Strangers online tell me to leave the person I love. But if I leave him, I have nobody. No family or friends who genuinely care about me. My boss tells me to try and find someone else... but if I do,  I don't want to fall in love, become attached and  be cast aside and used again.

 

Right now I am so overwhelmed of taking yet another risk only to feel disappointment again. I can't do it anymore. How many times do I have to lie to myself? Things will get better. You'll find someone who really loves you. You'll be happy. All the chances I've given myself up until now. All failure and no sense of achievement and security. I want to quit, I'm so tired of this. Everything hurts and feels so hopeless. Am I going to spend every year wishing I ended it? Seems like it. 

&amp;#x200B;

In the back of my mind I want to just go through some of my bucket list then either end myself ASAP or take some heroin, get rid of the pain and eventually die from heroin overdose.

418,"I’ve been in a high school musical for a while and today we had our performance. So many frustrations that were hidden in me came to light. First we had a show circle where everyone organized and shared some thoughts to the entire cast. My class was expected to do so today and I felt horrid sharing my thoughts. Everyone else shared personable memories and spoke about how much they enjoyed the musical. I had to lie, as I realized that I never enjoyed this show, people never talked to me at rehearsals and I just would be bored for hours on end.
During the performance I was equally as bored. I really felt as though I were going through the motions and utterly unimportant. 

I will say that I do have one friend in the musical, but I can’t help but be annoyed by him often. I would never tell him, but he can be so irritating. He rambles so often, makes this annoying bear sound constantly, and can be repetitive. What annoys me the most is how normal he acts to other people, but around me he becomes “insane”.  I’m a total asshole for not appreciating him, but I can’t help but be fed up by him a lot of the time.

Anyways, I really got upset by the after party, where we viewed a cast video that was put together. This video cemented how alone I was during the musical as everyone constantly laughed at memories they had but I didn’t recognize anything that happened. I’ve never been the happy person in front of the camera. I left the party early to go home and try to forget this musical ever happened.

422,"I had a bad breakup with an abusive girl. I thought it'd be good to end things, but I guess I can't really escape the mentality she put me in. 
I crave abuse. Not in a kinky way, more of an ""this is the only time I know myself"" way. I want to be hurt. My theory is that being hurt constantly puts me into a familiar point in time where I truly knew myself. I felt like I knew who I was supposed to be because I molded myself into what she wanted me to be. Her and other people who abused me. There's this innately pure energy that comes from my victimized self that I guess I learned to associate with in order to survive. But I left that behind in my freedom.
All I want is to be hurt again. I've had a lot of great women since the breakup who have wanted a relationship with me. I never could keep feelings for long, though. They're always so nice. I don't need to build up myself when I don't even know myself.

My mother has severe depression as well but has been able to successfully treat it for the past decade or so. My dad has a more mild situational form of depression, but still sees a counselor every once in a while. I’m probably at the lowest point I’ve ever been and no matter how much I ask for just some advice or someone to talk to, their responses are never consistent. Sometimes they offer some simple (and dare I say generic) advice, but I appreciate the effort nonetheless. Or they just blatantly avoid me. My father tends to treat my condition as more of a burden onto himself and prefers to yell at me about little things and start arguments full knowing that I’ll feel like shit afterwards, and my mother doesn’t do much to stop him. I can’t afford to move out by any means, and I wouldn’t be able to afford my medication without being on their insurance. I do see a counselor and a psychiatrist, but that’s just not enough.

I'm not doing well. I'm 33. In the last couple of months I've sliced open my hand and needed stitches, started PT for my left knee (haven't been able to run for 2 years, something I enjoyed), tore my ACL in my right knee (so I had to stop the PT), totaled my car, bought a new car and had it die on the interstate.

I don't have any friends and I don't know where to find any. I'm done with school and see like 2 people at work, that I don't want to hang out with. That means I can't find anyone to date either.

I started a new job which is ok, but many of my projects depend on other people to finish stuff, but they don't. They just browse Facebook all the time and I take the flack. My coworkers swear all the time and have really lewd conversations, which I don't like.

I've spent the past several years trying to find work with my masters in mechanical engineering but cant. Instead, I've been bouncing between part time jobs, so my career is in shambles and I'm super poor.

Thing is, i dont even know if I want to do mech eng. The job postings I see just dont seem enjoyable. But I don't know what else I would do. Im mildly interested in everything, but nothing really draws me in.

My siblings dont talk to me and my mom let me know the other day that I'm a disappointment and that she feels like I dont appreciate her. That really hurt. Im really lonely and it's really sad to think that if I got in a car accident or something and died not a single person in the world would be phased.  I talked to my dad about some of these concerns today on the phone but the conversation didn't go great.  He tried to offer support but I came away just feeling worse and that he didn't understand.

427,"As time goes on, the more I question why I do anything to better myself or even continue to survive. Therapists have asked me ""Why do you do things like working out or going to school despite feeling so hopeless?"". I have absolutely no answer other than that I don't want things to get worse. It's all damage control. I'm not thriving, I'm merely surviving. This is no way to live. I want to die, but not by my own hands. If there were a magic button I could press to cease my existence, I'd slam it without hesitation. Maybe with some extra motivation I'll actually end myself, that's a nice thought.

My main cause of my depression is pathetically simple: Complete lack of connection with everyone. I used to want a social life when I was younger, but honestly by my age all I want is a relationship. One single person who thinks I'm handsome, charming, and worth keeping. I'm a 23 year-old kissless virgin who has only had a long-distance ""relationship"" two years ago. I still miss her, which only serves to make me feel more pathetic.

I'm not the worst looking guy on the planet, but I sure feel like it. No woman irl has ever showed me even a little interest, therefore I must be worse looking than I sometimes think. I must be hideous. Gaining 20lbs at the gym did absolutely fuck-all in terms of my appeal to the opposite gender. There is no saving me from being so unappealing.

You could say ""Well, it's your bad attitude!"", but honestly that's simply not true. I put in a lot of effort, and my social skills aren't that bad. I think it's my personality. I'm ugly inside and out. Completely unappealing and completely unfuckable. I listen, I ask questions, I try to engage with others. My efforts mean nothing, I'm not worth knowing. I'm lucky if I'm even just a footnote in someone else's life.

What's there do to escape this lonely existence? Therapy? No. They don't help you solve anything, they only want you to learn your place. It's only beneficial to those who have good lives that they squander, or those who have a good thing going. Cheap and easy, it's a conveyor belt of ""wellness"". 

Self improvement? Has done literally nothing for me in terms of actually being appreciated in life. It's absolutely crushing when you scheme, plan, do, and nothing ever materializes from your efforts. I'm no closer to happiness than when I started. Small ""victories"" mean nothing, as my life is no better having reached them.

Try enjoying doing things alone? Evidently, doing things by myself is all I've ever been able to do. Depression killed my ability to enjoy my uninteresting time wasting hobbies, so it's a non-option anyway. I need people, I want connection. I could hold out for longer had I a choice in being alone or not. As it stands I have absolutely no control over my situation, therefore all I'm left with are questions and self-loathing.

430,"Why is suicide looked down upon. People say “it’s not an option” or say it’s selfish. I would agree that there is a degree of selfishness to suicide but using that as a reason for why it is a bad thing is nothing but hypocrisy. To tell someone who wants to die to keep living is the equivalent of telling a non-suicidal person to kill themselves. It’s like saying “why can’t you just ignore all of your pain so I/we don’t have to be sad if you die”. Ok, sure I get that making people sad is a bad thing  but the fact that people think this is somehow less selfish than killing yourself is absurd. 

Also huge fuck off to anyone saying “it will get better, it’s worth it to keep living there’s so much good in the world”. Better isn’t good enough. No amount of “good” or “happiness” will make it worth it. There hasn’t been a day where I thought “I’m glad I made it this far”. Even on the trip of a lifetime with everything anyone could ask for I still would’ve traded it all away to have been dead a few years earlier. All you are saying when you tell someone “it will get better, it’s worth it” is that you have no idea what you’re talking about. I’m sure your intentions are good but it makes exactly 0 sense to keep someone who’s attempted suicide multiple times and still wants to die around. The only reasons are those pertaining to how other people feel about their loss. I don’t want to get better, I want to be done-fuck your loss. 

I don’t know why people lie through their teeth telling themselves that it’s worth it or that they are happy. I don’t know what sense of fulfillment people get by droning on consuming resources and endlessly fighting for happiness. Why? Why go through all that effort? Because for most people it’s easier than considering death due to our deeply embedded instinct for survival. 

The problem is that some of us recognize when survival instincts drive what we do, and once this happens the whole illusion falls apart. Now, for me, eating is tedious, sex drive is an annoyance, and taking care of my body a never ending, exhausting chore. I want to do none of these things but my body forces me to. My body tries to trick me into thinking that these are good things, and most are fooled and even value these feelings. The easiest to explain (as it’s the only one not tied to living) is sex drive/ desire to have kids. I do feel lust/sexual attraction but it is painfully obvious that I don’t actually want to have sex, my instincts simply use hormones to make me think that I want to. Then neurotransmitters are released in the brain to reward giving into these instincts for the purpose of prolonging human existence. 

Well nowadays reproduction is more of a problem for our survival than a help, leaving it with no value- actually even negative value- after the optimal amount of new people have been born. 

The desire to have kids is even more selfish than asking a suicidal person to keep living. When you have kids because you want to, you are bringing someone into this world just because you seek a feeling of importance, or belonging, or accomplishment. Then you say that suicide isn’t an option, leaving the hypothetical child stuck in existence with the only reason for said existence being you felt “incomplete”. 
All I’m really trying to say is, in a world with too many people, why do we force people against their will to keep living? 

“If you end it now, you won’t get to experience what may be the best part of your life” 

Not like I’ll be around to regret it
“So many people love you”

Then they should want me to be in pain as little as possible

“Life gets so much better”

Better is not nearly good enough. I honestly would rather die right now than live through another year of this even if the rest of my life is completely happy

“But your so young”

The longer I live statistically speaking the more likely I am to kill myself. Also I’m way too old, I wish I died as an infant or even better not born at all. At 20 I already see my body decaying and why THE FUCK would I want to live on as my body gets weaker when I already don’t want to live 

“Depression is a mental illness you’re mind is sick these thoughts have no value”

Well they are my only thoughts and like I said I have no desire to “get better” so either let me die in peace or just keep dragging my limp existence through life just so you don’t have to feel sad... fucking prick

“Your depression is just an irregular amount of chemicals in your brain, you just don’t produce enough serotonin”

So is literally every emotion. You don’t hear me saying “you don’t actually love her your brain just knows that having a partner makes survival more likely as well as providing ample opportunity for procreation. You’re actually just feeling high levels of dopamine, serotonin, and oxytocin in your brain. When you find someone that could make a suitable long term mate, your brain makes you feel connected to them to make you go out of your way to protect them” because that would be a rude, borderline sociopathic thing to say (yes that is how it feels when you tell me this)

I’m not saying that the world or life for that matter is bad, it’s just not for me

431,"It's another night I can't sleep. I've been laying in my bed, looking at the ceiling and thinking. A lot of people are unsure of what to do with their lives. They usually get over it and go with the flow. What's the flow? A miserable dedication to a work that will bring you money you can spend on things that will bring you a brief transcient feeling of joy. You will work to buy things you won't have enough time to truly enjoy because you need to pay your bills and cover other required expenses. Working an unsatisfying, monotonous job that will drag you down as you wake up, go to work, do the same thing over and over again and go back to sleep for years without end. Meaningless.

Mankind - assuming it won't destroy itself - will eventually evolve. However, me, you, everyone else living right now, will not. We are at the peak of what our kind can evolve into right now. We are the pioneers of humankind's evolution and yet we're just animals. What really matters to such animals is an unending chase for happiness and sexual tension. Both so greatly out of my reach.

But no. 

I have an unstable family, with a history of mental disorders mixed with alcohol and drugs and I even fear that one is revealing in me. I don't do drugs or drink because of childhood traumas.

 I've been feeling down for almost 6 months now and it's tough, it's hard and no one cares if I'm ok. I feel like I have no friends. 90% of the people that talk with me is to ask me to do stuff or to help, not to know how I'm doing.

The rest I feel like I'm being used and I just don't understand. I don't have great social skills so I don't know how to be around people that well. At my job I don't talk to anyone and it makes me uncomfortable too.

I’m two years on meds that are working for me and I’m doing well enough to start taking steps for my future, trying to go back into school and to pursue a degree and career in nursing. 

And still. Still, when I have a quiet moment at my current dead end job, or a day off all to myself, or when I’m in bed beside my partner who’s already asleep. Basically anytime I’m alone with my thoughts. Still I have thoughts that I’m overreaching, that I’ll fuck up these carefully laid plans like I do everything else, that I’d be better off dead and/or gone. That I’m embarrassing myself with these pathetic attempts to be a “real” person, that everyone (my boss, the asshole customers at work, the people reading my job applications, the employees I’m encountering on my route back into school, my family, my partner’s family) can tell I’m faking my okay-ness and can see how fundamentally broken and fucked up and damaged I am. That they know something I don’t: that everything I attempt is going to blow back up in my face. 

Is this normal? In the grand scheme of things I’m doing pretty damn well relative to where I’ve been. I’m holding down a job and not constantly calling out in order to sleep and cry.

447,"Metaphorically of course.

I have a lot of issues, and I know I am not well. I have had depression for most of my life along with social anxiety and PTSD as a combination.
I known this friend for a year now, she tries her hardest to connect with me and be around me as much as possible--kind of like a child clinging to its mother in a way. She's a lot older then me, she's in her twenties, I am nineteen.
Anyway, she knows I have all these issues, but she didn't know how deep they really were. She knows I have my fears and my doubts, but she didn't know that I have attempted many times--even at a young age to kill myself.
No one knew this, not even my own family until about a week or two ago.
She knew I wasn't okay and I made a rule for myself to not push people over and over, ask them three times and if they don't answer you shouldn't force them to speak.
She however knew something was wrong because I haven't spoken to her in a few days and this was after a falling apart session with some of my now no longer friends.
They really worsened my condition after that.
She kept asking me if I was okay over and over again when each time I told her I was fine, at least fine enough I didn't want to hurt myself or kill myself.
After an hour or so she came back sad and begged me to tell her and how she felt like she wasn't a good friend because I wouldn't tell her anything.
She does this all the time, and has been doing it ever since I have known them. I finally snapped and told her for my own sake just to get her to leave me alone. I screamed at her telling her all the things I think about and how many times I tried to kill myself and how badly I wish I could just hurl myself off a bridge and hope it breaks all my bones killing myself.
If that didn't work I would just drown myself.
I even told her how when I look in the mirror I always see something different and I feel the need to break it and take its shards using them to stab myself in the legs hundreds of times in order to feel something other than anger or sadness.

After I told her that she finally left me alone for the night and I was happy. I felt a weight being lifted--not because I told her, but because I thought she wouldn't bring it up again. I was wrong.
The next day (today) she came back asking over and over again if I was okay.
Yeah, I was fine, I was having a good day and then she shows up pushing me again. So I scream at her again telling her more stuff she didn't need to know hoping it would shut her up and leave me alone.
I even told her during the hard times how everyone has been pushing me over and over again. Pushing me to do things, pushing me for stupid cosplay and pushing me for everything under the god damn moon. I was sick of it, I am sick of it.
I'm so tired of being pushed for information that I don't want to give to people I don't trust.
I only told my family because they needed to know. I was having a hard time cooping with my depression to the point it became too much to bear and my father being the asshole he was--wasn't helping.
I'm thankful for the friends that did leave me alone understanding I need time to piece myself back together, but **** doesn't seem to get it. 
I just want to be left alone and try to fix things myself, she can't do anything about it--I need to fix it myself by taking the right actions into seeking help. 
But the more she pushes me to tell her all of this stuff and how she does it really pisses me off and doesn't help at all. I don't want her help, I don't need her help. I just need to help myself and get this worked out by a professional.
I'm just so tired.",0

Basically I went to college in my home state for a semester and, long story short, I had no concept of finance in high school and chose a very expensive college to go to and I’m not 7k in debt as an 18 year old. I moved back in with my parents this semester because it saved thousands by not living in the dorms. I’ve made absolutely no friends at this school and the only person I know is my girlfriend who came with me to this college. We both are transferring to a different college next year that is much cheaper but this requires moving half a state away so I can no longer live with my parents, who are my only friends, and remain rent free. I have around $3,000 in my savings account from a job I worked previously but I did the math and even if I got a full time job now and continued working full time through my next year at school, I won’t make enough to afford rent and utilities.

So that’s it. My only friends are my girlfriend and my parents, my money is going to slowly dwindle away over the course of a year, and I can’t move back into the dorms because then I’ll have to take out more loans and be further entrenched. I just feel so hopeless. There’s nothing I can do because I can’t stay here with my family because then I’ll go into debt, and I can’t go to this cheaper school because I’ll be in debt.

Ever since I quit playing the guitar and being involved in music, I've lost all direction and meaning in life. I started playing guitar when I was 10 years old and I quickly became my thing. No, music was my all. I would practice guitar for hours, trying to perfect my technique. I took music theory courses in college and I really felt I was where I was meant to be. I was average academically, but I really ""got"" music for some reason and got straight A's in the classes (I was 12 at that point). I'm not saying this to brag, but to drive the point that it really was my element. There was this one moment I remember so clearly... I was at the college walking to another class and one of the janitors randomly pulled me aside and told me that I had this ""glowing"" presence. And that's how I truly felt at the time. But that was a long time ago...
When I was fourteen, my mother passed away from kidney failure. I watched her take her last breath and get carried away. I was absolutely devastated. Life was never the same again. She was my rock. She was the one who was there for all the countless hours of practicing and studying music. She would always tell me how great I was doing and how she was so proud of me. It gave me the motivation I needed when I didn't feel like sitting down and putting in the time and being diligent. In a way, when she died, my passion for music did too. My depression was too much for me that one day I just didn't pick the up the guitar again. My guitar teacher was trying to tell me to just get to it and to practice anyways, but I wasn't in the mental place to do so. It's like life turned black and white. I miss her so much.
A year later, my dad got remarried and brought his woman and new kids to the house. It didn't turn out well for them as a couple and the house was in total turmoil. As the second eldest in the house, I had to take up the responsibility to help out with my younger step siblings, take them to school, and be there for them in general. It wasn't a good situation.
The one moment I did play guitar again was for my school's yearly talent show. It wasnt a perfect performance because it had been some time since I had last performed, but people loved it anyway! Everyone except my dad. He told me it was the worst performance I had given and that he was ashamed that I did such a horrible job. What he said had crushed me. After that my relationship with my dad went sour. He got overly controlling, was telling me I was selfish, and was resentful that I had quit guitar after he had spent lots of money on my classes and tutoring. We just weren't getting along. I ended up getting kicked out and had to move in with my close friends from church. It was really embarrassing because everyone saw me as the ""good son"" of the family. I was a senior in high school at the time, so I had to transfer schools to where my friends were attending. The principle was really supportive and understanding of my situation and let me graduate at that school without paying tuition (it was a private school). Since it was the middle of the school year, I just decided to keep my head down and graduate. I didn't really fit in with the entitled, upper middle class kids there and didn't really make too many good friends.
When I graduated, my family showed up, and I got to see them for the first time in months. My dad went for the ceremony but didn't bother staying to talk afterwards. All I remember is my grandmother telling me that he rode off on his motorcycle because he was disappointed in me. This was a moment for me that I had really felt alone. I sat down on a bench, looked around and saw everyone having a great time, taking pictures with friends, having their family's support, and just being happy. What had went wrong? How did everything turn out this way??
The end of summer came and my friend I was staying with asked me if I would want to go to college with him. It was the night before he was leaving and I decided to just say ""fuck it"" and went with him. I went to major in nursing because i was in complete survival mode at this point and nursing is a secure job. But I felt absolutely horrible about it. It just seemed so life-draining to me. So I transferred my major to music. But I didn't really plan it out (obviously, right?) and the school was having me take out massive loans to cover for tuition, books and literally everything. I was beginning to feel trapped and that my life was spiraling out of control. So I left and moved back in with my dad, an absolutely horrible decision. I was there for two years, not doing shit. I was depressed, a failure, and outcast. I eventually started to get on top of my shit though and got a job and started to save some money. I was planning to buy a car and then save for a downpayment on an apartment, but before I could carry out that plan, my dad and I got into a fight and he kicked me out once again. One of my friends was moving to Vegas for college and I decided to go with him. See a pattern? I couldn't at the time. Anyways, I went to look for work there, but since I wasn't twenty-one yet none of the casinos would hire me. So, I decided to move in with a cousin and this is where I'm at now. I've been working in the food industry and juggling two jobs to make ends meet and pay off my debt. I dont really have friends here because I dont have the time. There are still days when I feel incredibly lonely and have anxiety about how low people probably think of me. But I just try to carry on as best I can. I've been getting into self-developement a bit too. When I have time, I try to hit the gym, and maybe spend some quiet time in nature to reenergize. I've also been getting into some meditation and positive affirmations, and I find that it helps somewhat. I am just trying to get to a point where I can live life and get back to my music. Itll be another year till I'll be able to afford my own apartment and buy a new car. I'm so close to getting there and I know it will happen! I'm going to start doing my music again too. I want everyone to experience something beyond what words can say. I want people to experience new sounds, intricate rhythms, and tonal colors. Everytime I hear a song on the radio I know I can do it better. Music today seems like it's just about the money. You can tell by how most of the music sounds the same. Same chords. Same progressions. Same sounds -- frankly, it's lazy! I want to bring the art back, give people something real to feel again.
Anyways, if you've gotten this far, thank you for hearing my story. Obviously this is a brief version, but I just wanted to share because I've never really expressed or told anyone how I am doing or what I'm going through. I guess this is how I would actually want to reply to someone who asked me how I am doing though. But of course it would be ridiculous to dump this much baggage onto someone randomly. LOL awkwarddd... ",0

460,"so i'm actually in a good place depression-wise but i'm posting this here just in reference to depression as a topic.  yesterday was kurt cobain's death day and i know this because my boss is obsessed with the 90's grunge/punk rock band 'nirvana' (if you don't know, kurt cobain was the lead singer and committed suicide 25 years ago yesterday).  my workplace is a warehouse and we have a group meeting every day to get announcements and do stretches before starting our shift.  yesterday it was all about the mental health services our employer provides which is like some hotline or something that's geared specifically to warehouse workers.  my boss kept making references to some incident like 'with all that's been going on, i thought this was really relevant' and making it sound like someone in our shift was going through something.  everyone i know found that odd because we all had no idea who or what he was talking about.

getting to work after announcements, my neck was killing me from straining it the day before.  like, so bad it was giving me a headache and an upset stomach so i wasn't really in a great mood.  when break time came around, one of the biggest gossips at work asked me if i was okay.  confused i said 'ya, of course' forgetting the physical pain from my neck.  she said she only asked because the person i'd been working with that morning had told her i seemed off.  i could tell she was looking for something juicy like that i was the one being referenced at the group meeting.  i told her i was fine and just had neck pain and it was effecting me.

the part that kind of pisses me off is that people seem to only 'reach out' and want to know if you're okay when it's convenient for them or suits their agenda.  we had a worker who left a month or two ago who was severely, openly depressed and everyone hated her.  nobody ever wanted to know if she was okay because it was obvious she wasn't and she'd actually talk about it.  granted, she was really annoying and the constant negativity got on my nerves but she was openly sick and nobody gave a shit.  and if i were depressed, the coworker yesterday who 'reached out' to me wouldn't have actually given a shit either, she'd just be pleased to have gleaned a useful little tidbit of gossip.  to be fair and honest, even i don't care too much about the mental health of near strangers but i also don't pretend to or use it against them or for my own gain.      ",0
461,"I posted on here a couple weeks ago regarding a similar small episode. That was more of a situation that was affecting me. Although the same situation is part of this, the feelings are stretching more to just hatred of myself. Let me explain quickly if I can.

I got broken up with like 7 weeks ago, and I don't think I've moved on yet. She's my best friend, and was for 9 months before the relationship started. We still talk every day. I don't think us talking causes feelings to linger. But she's with another guy now who ""brings out the best in her."" Great, good for her. Truly. But it makes me feel like I wasn't, and just aren't, good enough. It hurts knowing this guy's making her happy. It hurts knowing she's happy and I'm depressed.

I struggle so much with self-esteem. I don't feel that I'm good enough for anyone, and especially so with my depression. I don't feel that anyone should have to put up with my mental health. I also feel that I'm a fairly unattractive person. Or at the very least, that maybe I am, but there are plenty of other guys who are more attractive and have less mental health issues that girls would rather have. It doesn't help that I'm interested in girls that a lot of guys consider extremely attractive. I'm close to messaging one, but I don't know if it's a good idea if I don't think I'm moved on from the past relationship. Plus, if I were to be rejected, I'm gonna withdraw and never out myself out there again.

Thanks for the read. Any advice is appreciated

474,"My head feels like shit. 
The last time I truly felt some form of positive emotion was the weekend before spring break. Aka in February. Since then I've just been bleh. Void.
I haven't been able to keep on my sleep schedule for weeks - I either get too caught up on things or can't get myself to go to bed. (Recently found out that executive dysfunction is a thing, and I guess that's what describes this best)
I have no purpose in life. Now that I'm finally studying in what I like it just seems as though I have no goal anymore.
My friend group at school is super cool but I feel like I'm just a tool to them most of the time. I'm good at drawing but I have no culture in anything else they enjoy. One of them is draining everything out of me.
I would try to gain knowledge in those things they enjoy but I can barely spark up interest and motivation to invest myself in anything new anymore.
My classes are draining everything out of me. I may have less classes due to not having the basic courses but they still drain me a ton.
I skipped on Friday and no one bothered try to reach for me while they rushed to do so for the others that were absent the previous morning. My mother was only discouraged and like ""Don't make this a habit."" I literally never skip class. 

It's frustrating because before this year I went to another college closer to my mother's house which had me at the worst fucking place in my life. I've honestly always felt like I do, I've always been like this for as far as I can remember, but going to college in a program I despised because my mom indirectly wanted me to (hinted A LOT at it) completely wrecked me. I had had a few suicidal instances in my secondary school years but never had I fully contemplated it until then. Back then I knew I wouldn't last 2 years of hell so I made a letter dumping everything to my mom.
In 2018 I worked to get where I am now. I did my second semester with only basic courses. I got my drivers' license, had my first job, applied for colleges with the program i wanted. Found my apartment. I still felt awful/felt barely anything through most of it though. I would tell myself ""if it doesn't work out, I might as well just kill myself""
I was completely numb moving into my apartment and starting the college year. The first months were a rough patch as I didn't speak to anyone in class, being naturally shy and quiet. Then in a spiral people started talking to me and socializing went through the roof. Ive never been so socially involved with people ever, like at all.
For a moment I peaked a little. I had a better outlook on life and felt a little bit at times. Though I have an inner love/hate relationship with the person I talk to most. She's a lot to handle. She's fun to hang out with but she's draining and hurtful at times. That coupled with the fact that she just this week randomly dumped on me in casual conversation that this guy (that I personally was interested in getting to know better/possibly date) is now her boyfriend.
I'm beyond frustrated.

Last week or this week (I dont remember) this other girl also talked of her similar experience to mine, though in her first year of college she did not know what she wanted to do and eventually she dropped out starting her second year and took a gap year to recover from burn out.

Ever since I started this year I really really wish I would have taken a gap year because I can't enjoy it to the fullest with my mental state. I know it's not too late, but I'm scared to lose everything I've worked so hard for. I've also already signed the contract to keep my room/apartment next year.

I just don't know what to do. I can keep going through the motions like I always have but eventually I'll just break.

I've been trying to hint stuff to my mom, and for so long. When I wrote her the letter in 2017 I eventually had an appointment/had my blood drawn for tests in 2018. The doctor prescribed me some antidepressants and I didnt get a call back on the blood test, so it's assumed everything is fine. I was told to go see the psychologist at my college from then but I honestly didn't want to have anything to do with the college back then. Also because it would have been weird, and I would have been embarrassed for some reasons. I wanted to see anyone but that psychologist (especially related to that college).
But I can't approach my mom for shit. You can never predict how she'll react; just as when i admitted to skipping she was just like ""Dont make it a habit"" ""You're a student you have to work! That's life"" ""If you can barely manage this I can't imagine how it'll be next fall when you have more courses added onto your schedule""
It hurts me more knowing she's had depression before, and though 1. I'm not even sure this is it 2. If it is it's a milder (but constant over the years) version of it, she of all people should know how it's like, obviously. Seems not.

479,"Yesterday I was on my way to kill myself. I was walking to a bridge. I couldn’t get on the bus though, it scared me what I was doing. I have PTSD, depression, and dissociation. I have felt dead since the end of high school. I am almost 27 now. Depression has completely overtaken me and has distorted everything I think and feel. The stupid thing about all of this though was that the “bad” situations I’ve been through have not been worthy of getting depression I feel like. I feel like someone else could go through what I went through and come out fine while I have to go everything with shit colored glasses on turning all of my experiences into terrible ones. I’m sick of not being honest. About how I feel, what I think. I pretend like everything is fine and I am so sick of it. 

The bad situations I have been through involve people in positions of authority over me abusing their power emotionally and spiritually. But I always second guess that these things are valid. I have been exorcised without my consent, have been in toxic environments involving my peers and professors in college, and have been sort of physically abused-being directed in a play to walk around like an animal past exhaustion for well past the normal number of hours you should be rehearsing-I had bruises all over me and there was blood on the stage sometimes. I also felt like I was being hypnotized by one of my professors without my consent but I am not sure that this is true too. She thought she knew who I was, and would often tell me who she thought I was, trying to convince me to believe it. This played with my identity. I have a hard time formulating words for what I’ve experienced. I’m not sure if I will ever really understand what I experienced. 

I have PTSD and I don’t even completely understand why. 

I need help and I’m in counseling but I can’t seem to pull out of this. And the thing is, I had depression before any of the trauma happened.

The 15-minute rule is as follows; let's say your feeling overwhelmed about taking the trash out. So, instead of thinking about it step by step, think to yourself ""I'll do it for 15 minutes, then I'll quit"" and you'll find that you will complete the whole task within the 15 minutes, most of the time. Which leads to the other thing she taught me today; after you accomplish something you've been putting off, congratulate and thank yourself. As ridiculous as it sounds, write yourself a thank you note and congratulate and reward your self. Also, you can congratulate yourself in a sarcastic voice if you want because you can't say it seriously, just as long as you say it.

493,"It's my birthday today, just turned 21. I've been down the whole day and my mom could supposedly hear it in my voice when she called me this evening.  We only spoke for about a minute before she passes the phone to my baby sister but I wasn't really engaging with her either. Towards the end of the call, it got silent and I couldn't hear anything from their side anymore so I said my goodbyes hoping they could hear me and dropped the call.

Apparently I messed up because she calls me a few minutes later telling me she's tired of me and she can't do it all by herself, and she had my baby sister to take care of. I told her I was sorry, trying my best to not sound like I wasn't being torn apart, to sound upbeat for her but she wasn't hearing it. I didn't know what else to say to her and she dropped the call. 

I had a total emotional breakdown after that, I felt so alone. I feel alone. I haven't been speaking to any of my friends and to hear my mom basically tell me she couldn't deal with my depressing shit anymore really broke me.

My final exams for those classes are on Monday and Thursday (the 3rd course does not have a final exam and I'm surprisingly doing very well in that class). 

My Thursday final: there really isn't even any point in me going. I've failed all of the ""midterms"" thus far so nothing I can do on my final will bump me up to a passing grade (and yes, I've talked with the instructor). 

My Monday final: there's hope that I can pass that course, but I have absolutely no drive to get caught up and study right now. I'm struggling so hard and the procrastination makes it sooo much worse.

499,Apologies this post is a bit of a downer and has been asked before. I recently tried to commit suicide by jumping off of a bridge. Turns out the jump wasn't high enough and all I got was a broken knee and a nasty cut on my head. I passed this off as just a drunk accident to my parents. They have known for a while that I've been depressed but I doubt they would have thought this sort of action was a possibility. I'm sure that if I tell them this it will pretty much destroy them. But it would be good to get their advice on this (and just be honest). After this event I have not tried again. Should I tell them or tell someone else to prevent the emotional problems and distrust that are likely to last forever because of this? Thanks in advance for any advice given.,0

I know I have posted this before (but never in this much detail) but I need to get of my chest again, and last time I posted this was different, why? I asked advice on how to commit suicide but I have recently been to afraid to ‘’pull the trigger’’ so to say, whenever I try to take my life I always fail and get more traumas than one! so now I’m just trying (unfortunately) to prevent myself from ending it all.

I like to remind you that some people might be shocked reading this but eh everyone here seems to have expierenced horrible shit. But just so you know.

So a few weeks ago in the beginning of February I walked down the staircase in the middle of the night to overdose myself with medication to end it all, I took alot of pills and rememberbeing so happy, I smiled and thought ‘’Maybe I will in my sleep’’ so I went to bed ready to die… WELL THAT WAS A MISTAKE!!

I woke up as if someone was pulling cables out of my brain, my blood boiled like crazy and my survival instinct took over and honestly… I do not want to die in pain! I want to point out that my memory has been ‘’modief’’ by my therapists so I won’t keep seeing it happen again and again in my head everyday so this will be hard to recreate.

Dad was downstairs, I screamed I have finally done it and he asked ‘’What?’’ and I answered as a drunk ‘’I commited suicide’’ I fell on the ground and he thought I might have had a trrible dream… Than I said one second later ‘’I took pills’’ and he raced towards the phone downstairs and called doctors and what not. I had to call mom and so I did but I could barely move… She came downstairs and was in shock to see me not able to move. I needed help to get downstairs and I laid there on the couch as they watch over me and have the doctors on the other side of the line.

They left for 1 minutes to get something out of the car, why I don’t remember anymore and when exactly to but I tried to stand up, wanting to finish the job but fell back on the couch, I was so weak…

I was ‘’mighly poisoned… A little bit’’ better to say and I was not gonna die according to them… I will only have to suffer for 8 hours long except if I went to the hospital to empty my stomac… But I took the medication 6 hours ago so it was already flowing through my veins and blood.

I needed to go to the toilet and somehow was able to do that without help… For 5 minutes though, I left the door unlocked just in case if something might happen. I didn’t puke or anything like that, after I was done my father brought me back to the couch and my mother had my therapist on the otherline. I laid there with the phone in my hand and we talked for 1 minute or 2… Maybe 5 I don’t know I needed to talk to another doctor according to my therapist (My therapist adviced my parents to remove all the medications, medicenes and etc out of my reach and I felt powerless but I understood why they did it… But I just wanted to die) the doctor who was in charge of my medication… But he was unavailable at the current moment for reasons I don’t remember so another doctor talked to me (I’m not mad or anything, no one saw it coming and it was my chose to begin with) but after 10 seconds hell happened, I had to hang up and started screaming in agony! My father stared at me with a pale face and my mother was sitting next to me as it happened… I screamed and yelled from the pain, it was if someone cut a wound in every part of my body and pulled it open with his bare hands and tried to rip out the bones or break them! It was if someone threw hot licker over me and a rain of poisenes orange juice over the body that makes you melt. My muscles fought against me and I was surprised I wasn’t crying… I only screamed… The pain became worse by the minute, I wanted to puke maybe the medication will leave the body BUT THAT WASN’T POSSIBLE OF COURSE! I looked into my mothers eyes and I felt so bad for her and dad that they had to see me like this and begged when I was able for forgiveness and they weren’t mad at all they felt only horrible for me.

But than I said things I never would’ve imagined ‘’KILL ME!!’’ I yelled, the pain became so intense I wanted to die so bad so freaking bad! My father stood there nailed to the ground with open mouth forming the letter O and mother looked at him for a second or two in complete shock. I said sorry not much later… Maybe I said KILL ME AGAIN but I don’t know… I wanted to die I remember… I remember I said that.

First my feet stopped moving, than it went up to my knees, to my hips, to my belly and eventually I could only move my head, ‘maybe my body is saving energy to fight it?’ I thought as sweat was all over my face as I looked at my lifeless body with big tired sleepy eyes. It didn’t take long for what happened next.

I felt my body again as if someone was blood bending me, I felt my blood trying to get through my skin but that is just my feelings of course and how I remembered it… The feeling was so overwelming I screamed even louder and wanted to end… Maybe I asked them to kill me again but I don’t know… My parents only said to me they were shocked to hear I demanded them to kill me, their blood, their son they loved (still do) and raised from birth.

My left armer was lying somewhere behind my head on a pillow if I remember… The pillow hurted my arm and I asked mom to move my arm and she placed it carefully on my belly next to my right arm. I begged again for forgiveness and they kept saying that I don’t have to say sorry. I wanted them to call the 911 equivalent of my country because I thought I was dying and maybe they had something against the pain (But the last part I did not say.. I was weak and had not enough energy) but father said that the pain will eventually end and I kept asking for an ambulance or the hospita land mom reacted the same… But than I started screaming out of pure anger as the pain became worse, it felt like if someone was shooting needles in my body when I felt my heart bounching in my throat and than again in my chest trying to rip my bones apart… Or maybe escape.

I felt so much pain and used as much energy and strenghed I had left ‘’CALL… 9…1…1’’ As I fell down and father kept calling doctors and they all gave the same answer… Now my muscles were twisting, I asked mom to remove my arms/hands from my belly BECAUSE THEY WERE TWISTED AND ALMOST STARTED PULLING MY SKIN FROM THE BELLY. She placed them next to me and now mom lost her temper and demanded the phone and father gave her the phone after a few seconds because she believed I was dying even though he didn’t believe it. Please don’t take my father as a heartless monster he is a great man and I love him BUT he just tries to stay as calm as possible in these situations and kept checking on me and still remembers what happened all those weeks ago and feels terible. He even asked days of from work or that he can work at home for a few weeks to look after me. He tried to think as objectively as possible to make the most logical decisions… But that didn’t stop me from demanding that goddamn phone! I was never met at him btw!

Mom called the emergency survice and they raised to my house and my father went outside to guide them to our home. My muscles relaxed and I closed my eyes… I closed my eyes and I felt… Empty… I thought I was dying and mom was talking tot he doctors again and they said I had to stay awake… But I was tired and… I fell myself entering the abyss, as if I drifted slowly to the bottom of the ocean and everything around me became absolute darkness… I was afraid that I was gone and that my mom and dead have a dead person lying on their couch… I opened my eyes! I was stil here I was urprised and gasped for air… Something in me get’s excited when thinking about entering the abyss again as I write this down but why? Maybe because it’s all I want from dead perhaps? I don’t like living and it’s what a want… But at that moment I was afraid and felt horrible for my parents.

1 minute before the ambulance people arrived at our doorstep the attack was over and I had control again over my body, I looked like a person who recently puked after seeing guts or something close that. They checked my heart beat and talked with a few people on the phone, they said I was midnly poisoned just to check again and well I have no permenant damage BUT if I had taken more I would be dead and they were unable to do anything because the medication was already flowing through my body.

Some of the neighbours checked our house but never asked what happened maybe cause they didn’t want to ask or they though it had to do with someone else who lives close by and has been ill for weeks.

‘Can we ask you why you did it?’ they asked and I said, ‘yes’ and here comes the shocker… I told them the same answer I gave my parents when they dragged me down the staircase ‘I don’t know’ after so many years my doctors, therapists and etc still don’t know why I wanna commit suicide. We don’t know if it’s something in my genes, DNA or my head we still haven’t figured it out exactly what the cuse of it is. I only know it has been with me since I was a child.

I felt depressed when I was 7 years old and never really felt alive before that to. I startwed cutting when I was like… Let’s say 13 I believe and it felt good and yes it hurted but it feels good. I try to control it but sometimes I cut again.

My father helped me to get to the car later so we can meet the doctors who are in control of my medication and are in contact with my therapists. We (Me and the entire family) talked for 1 hour and 30 minutes I believe and when they asked me I will try it again even after going through so much pain I responded without doubt, I didn’t think twice, ‘I try it again and again and again untill I succeed, I know you guys feel bad but I’m sorry’.

We talked about putting me in special hospital and I didn’t object at all… but I can’t fo there for one reason and that is economic bullshit. We went home after that and I lied there on the couch for atleast 2 weeks.

2 Weeks of pain: My muscles had to be rebuild through training, my stomic and guts got a big hit, I needed help to get agrose the room, I wasn’t able to move much, barely able to eat anything, I slept atleast 3 or 4/5 hours each day because of the pain and nightmares I started cring as soon as I woke up. I had several panic attacks each day and still now but luckily less. I took after a while MANY pills each day that I was aloud to take against the pain.

My friends came to visit me and a boy I had a cruch on for atleast… Let’s say years (He knows) stayed for a while and we kissed many times and hugged but he is not in love with me, he did it to please me I guess which is oke I have no problems with that I’m just happy he was there. I like girls to but boys have my preference XD.

I have been talking to my friends much more and family but… I still wanna die and I’m afraid to kill myself again I’m afraid of failure. If I do again I will just hang myself, jump from a building or something with gas that makes you fal asleep really fast and kills you… No pain what so ever… I recently get more therapy, we use methods against PTSD (Post Traumatic Stress Disorder) so I will stop seeing my near dead expierence with a train, a car riding almost over my head, school days and to stop me seeing terrible things like… Destroyed human body parts luckily that I can survive… People living even though they should be dead… I never saw it in real life but some people just like to post stuff that show someone dying in cruel sadastic ways, people jumping of balcony’s and hitting the ground, dismembered body parts, head removed from body on rails… Things that are horrific and I try to forget… I remember now that my school people liked to watch that shit and sended me it ugggggh!

Sometimes my brain forces me to look up that stuff and watch it and I almost puke, I know that I’m not standing there when it happens but still though… ugh… Luckily people stopped sending me dead people and dogs beaten to dead online through forums and my Playstation account.

Honestly even though I swear my mental health is going backwards… 2019 is WAY better than the last years of my life but I still wanna sleep forever.

506,"All I want is to be in love and to be loved by someone else

I’m an extremely depressed individual who most likely has agoraphobia. I’m a college senior who is not going to pass my classes unless I can get incompletes and work from home. A little background on me is that I originally came from a middle class family that was decimated financially by my father’s legal abuse during my parent’s divorce. By this I mean he would subpoena my mother every week so that she would be bankrupt and unable to work. During this time I took to the internet and made friends about mutual interests in video games. One of these friends ended up sexually abusing me for at least 2 years. He would frequently ask me to masturbate for him, send him pictures of me in my underwear, and when I would retaliate, he would bully me and compare me to other girls telling me I should be grateful that he has any sexual interest in such an ugly child as myself. At one point he coaxed me to cut myself and send him the pictures. Maybe for sexual gratification? I don’t know. Anyway it got the the point where he would harass me on other platforms till I responded. I was afraid he would doxx me too. I was 12-14 years old. 

It finally ended. I can’t remember why. It just stopped. But I felt absolutely miserable and hated myself. He had driven me to a suicide attempt once before. I was bullied in school and neglected by my family. I hated myself and how I looked so much I would scream and cry in front of mirrors for hours.

I’m middle school I met a guy who would eventually become my first boyfriend. I really liked him. Talking to someone had never made me so happy before. And for awhile the relationship, which started my freshman year of high school, made me happy. It changed when I wanted to kiss him. For the first couple of months, there was no physical contact outside of hugging. And when I wanted to kiss him once, it was like the floodgates opened, and he started pressuring me into sex, refusing to wear a condom, not asking me if I wanted to before initiating. I felt so sick at this time. I thought I might have been pregnant. I broke up with him because I couldn’t do it anymore. When summer came, we started seeing each other again. And that’s when he raped me behind a baseball diamond. I cried the entire summer and took so much Benadryl to sedate myself. It felt like my entire world had changed.

I’ve had other shitty stuff happen before. I’ve been hospitalized in the psych ward. I’ve become a 24 year old alcoholic. And now, after being rejected by someone I care about because I am too soft and nice looking, not odd enough looking, I feel horrible and don’t know what to do. It’s funny because I’ve spent my whole life feeling as though I look like a monster, only to be told I’m too attractive for someone I felt a deep connection with to be attracted to me. I don’t even want a relationship. I don’t even want sex. I just wanted to be loved by someone and love them too. 

What do I do? Why am I contemplating suicide over these people?

510,"Just wanted to come on here to vent. I'm a 30 year old man and I'm really at the bottom of a spiral right now. I've made so many efforts to be good and have a decent life but instead it hangs over me as a waste of effort and a failure. It's hard for me to complain because people don't understand how I can fail so badly to end up where I am.   


My background: I was a scrawny small kid my entire life being sort of poor and basically living off peanutbutter sandwiches, I was 5'9 and 105 lbs when I graduated highschool. I did horrible in school and was constantly picked on so I just played videogames at my friends house to cope and skip school. When I graduated I said things had to change, I spent the next 3 years working and going to community college so I could go to university. After such hard work I finally got into a great university and engineering program. It was difficult, I spent 16+ hours of each day working on improving my life- I would go to school, then work, I started going to the gym every day, study and do homework then go to bed. Didn't even take weekends off because I wanted to do well. Probably the most miserable and stressful time of my life, but I managed to do it and I got an engineering degree and improved my health to be a robust 180 lbs. I looked at all of this as a struggle that would make my life better but I couldn't be any more wrong. I did OKAY in school but apparently not well enough to land any job interviews, I got injured by a driver while I was riding my bike and basically lost all the progress I made on my body/weight,etc. I've been working at a grocery store on night shift the last 3 years while all the people I went to school with are happy in their engineering careers making good money, starting families and getting houses. I still try to apply for jobs sometimes but I suspect there is bias against people like me that have basically just spent all their best years floundering around. When I look back, I see nothing positive in my life- I didn't have friends and still don't.. most people say college is the time of their life but I can only recall 2 or 3 times that I even went out with acquaintances to celebrate a successful project, on top of being unsuccessful in career and health goals I still haven't had a girlfriend or even been on a date, no hint of anyone even being interested in me even. The people I work with have hobbies or are older people with kids to take care of which gives them some purpose in earning money I guess, but at this point I just go to work, stare at the ceiling until I fall asleep, and do the same thing the next day. I don't even like my childhood coping tool of video games.. I perceive them as a chore not unlike cleaning the house or doing laundry. I question every day if other people that are stuck in a dead-end like me are just as miserable, but it seems like even the older folks I work with that had backgrounds like being poor, working labor jobs for 20 years straight, etc. are content with this life that I find so miserable so I must be missing something.",0

513,"In high school, for about a year and a half I was the butt of an ongoing joke amongst my so called friends.

It all started when somebody remarked on how non-expressive I often was. I guess I wasn't the most confident kid. I had never fit in in primary school; one kid back then (popular, could call him the leader figure of the friend group, you know how it is when you're young) even told me I was like ""a puzzle piece that doesn't fit, and you drive us all apart"". So yeah, I wasn't popular buy I digress. Back to highschool...

So when high school rolled around I had subconsciously learned to hide my feelings and thoughts, I mean that way people can't shoot you down or take the piss right? Anyway, the joke of likening me to a statue began and it really stuck. You know how kids can really kill a joke and just overdue it? Well that x1000. We could be hanging out, talking about games or whatever, and someone would notice me not joining in too much for whatever reason, and BAM the onslaught began. I'm sure they told themselves it was just a bit of fun, but they could see I didn't like it yet they continued. They'd spin me around as they said it, laughing hysterically. Usually I'd go along with it, laugh it off. I wasn't oversensitive, I could take a joke even at my own expense. But this went on for a year and a half.

We could be sitting in the classroom around a table, going our work, and I'd have my head down on the table between my hands, trying to block it out. You have to realise I was never a happy kid anyway, I had panic disorder, boat loads of anxiety, and I'd be fatigued a lot of the time. Some days I just couldn't summon the energy to go along with it and brush it off. Seeing me like that, they just continue, laughing and making joke after joke without giving single shit. These were smart kids as well, they weren't chavs, they were clever, had good grades, were in the top set classes etc. Not at all your stereo type for a bully.

I really am not describing the bullying very well at all, but it's exhausting to remember and type up a summary that would paint an accurate picture, do I won't. Point is, now my confidence as at an all time low and my issues really started to fester.

I grew to hate my own smile, and in fact any emotion at all. I tried to avoid interacting with people, even adults, for fear of them thinking I was like a stone statue and thinking I was weird. So I went years of my life, from highschool to college (which I dropped out from because of a plethora of reasons) and then to Canada where I couldn't make any friends (or have the belief that I even could), to uni (which I dropped out in my second year because, well thats something I won't go into ) and even now, I'm trying to find another job after quitting my precious two.

If someone smiles at me while I'm walking down the street, despite wanting to smile back I'll pretend I didn't see them or respond in the most minimal way possible. It's like a sickness that has destroyed my social skills and prevents me from enjoying myself in a group of people. Because I'm afraid to act like a human.

It's destroyed me.

I can't go into a relationship, not because girls don't like me, but because I think that I'm fake, I'm not who people think who I am, I try to be as nice to people as I can to people, I try almost to be another person just to pass a good impression to people, but I'm afraid of have a relationship with those people because I know this mask doesn't last so much and they will discover that I'm a sad and boring person, so I prefer not to maintain relationships.
I got also too lazy, can't even get up of the bed, and I procrastinate a lot, I barely go to the gym or university 
Things that then brought me joy and happiness, today don't make me feel anything.
I don't see any sense in life, I feel like I don't have any true friends and no one will miss me if I suddenly quit this world.
I no longer see any sense in life.
When people look to me I feel like they're judging me badly.
I've already been in a psychologist, but he didn't solve my problem, he was crazier than me, he told me his dog did astral trips and asked me questions that made me uncomfortable.
What do I do? I don't want to need to take medicines.
I look at the mirror and don't see anything.

517,"I have had different kinds of bodily symptoms over a long time and for a long time, i believed that I was seriously physically ill without ever telling anyone. I had panic attacks for a long time. Sometimes it got better for some time, then again it got worse. It went up and down, but all in all I did function well enough to go about with my everyday life. Last year though, after I had had to deal with a lot of love-related stress, new symptoms popped up. It started with enormous pain in the back and from one day to the next I couldn't normally sleep anymore. Obviously, I was really worried at that point that I was physically ill and that that was now kind of coming to the surface, but after seeing several doctors and being examined at hospitals I realized that physically there was nothing wrong with me. For more than 6 months now I've been sleeping really poorly and my digestion isn't working as normal. I've also got a slight vision disorder that has no physical cause. It's really frustrating at this point. What I know now is that for many years I've had an anxiety disorder and I know that those bodily symptoms that appeared last year can be related to depression, but what I don't have is that 'typical' mindset you always read about. I don't feel like nothing makes sense or anything and there's a lot of things I enjoy and want to do. Right now I'm just really frustrated by the enormity of my symptoms (especially the insomnia). Thus my question: can depression manifest itself mainly in bodily symptoms?

I don't think i'll ever kill myself, but then again, i never thought i'd be so frustrated and upset that i'd drive my fucking head into the kitchen bench until i couldn't stand up anymore.

528,"Let me start here. Ever since I was little, I’ve always thought I was an extremely sad person. Most people can’t tell, but recently it’s been bleeding into my façade that I try to hold. 

A year ago, when I was 20, my mom died. She was my closest confidant, along with my girlfriend of 2 years, who broke up with me only a few months before my mom’s death. She had lung cancer and I took care of her in her last few months. Watching such a strong role model degrade into nothingness is the worst thing I’ve ever experienced, especially since I couldn’t stop it from happening, I could only make her feel as comfortable as possible until she passed. I can’t begin to explain the daily pain I feel from the loss of her alone. 

My mom was my only family in the US, so the most logical answer was to leave the US for a while and visit my family, right? Well that’s what I did. Having not seen them for years, the disconnect between them and I was very apparent. Though I was there to be consoled, I felt very alone and was forced to meet a very rigid schedule that they set for me. All I wanted to do was lie in my bed and feel sad, but I was constantly told to get up early and be active, and to stop being sad. This only made me feel worse, that I had to hide my feelings from people who claimed to care about me. This is the typical South Asian approach to every matter, after all.

Upon returning to the US, I moved to my university, thinking it would help me focus on school more and stop wallowing. I was okay for a couple months and was talking to girls and hanging out with friends but began feeling numb to any emotion. I was never able to connect with any of them on an emotional level and still felt alone, but it was manageable.

All of a sudden, my uncle (who was in charge of my inheritance from my mom) stopped sending me money or replying to my pleas. Ever since January, I have struggled to make it through each day. Borrowing money from my dad and friends is the only way I’ve made it to April. This lack of financial security started the decline of my mental health once again. 

I started talking to my ex again and we’ve hooked up a few times but her unwillingness to commit to me has only made things worse. She’s the only person who I actually feel makes me forget the pain (even for the short amount of time we spend together), and I know that I still love her, despite it all. Though I don’t tell her the extent of my depression, I’m sure she’s noticed that I am unhappy with life. I’ve wanted a relationship, but her, having dated other people since our breakup, is not over her most recent ex. She doesn’t want to pursue anything with me currently and just wants to get through college and move to NY, which is understandable. Though I want to be with her and know that I will continue to feel sad that our relationship isn’t like it used to be, the value of our closeness precedes anything in my life at the moment.

It’s gotten to the point where I’m just going through the motions of this mundane, university life. I feel like a robot who just carries out tasks, all while my emotions are slowly building up. At this point, every small bad thing that happens brings me to a worse state of mind. I can feel the decline of my will or hope for the future. 

At this point, I feel like I’m going to end up killing myself or simply joining the Navy to escape all the bullshit that I associate with this place (which would come with their own detriments). I don’t see the point in living if you just carry sadness around, so much so that it constantly affects the people around you. I understand that my life is probably a lot better than some other’s in the world, but I can’t control how deeply I feel this pain. I’m only 21, but I don’t even relate to people the same age as me anymore, nothing seems fun or interesting and living in a boring ass town doesn’t help. I’m tired of being alone.

I can't think properly. I have lost interest in my subject (which i was passionate about, physics), future seems uncertain, I'm scared. I don't see the point in doing anything.",0
530,"Seeking advice on distancing oneself from your parents:

Today I poured my soul out to my mom about my dream career after graduation. I realized I’m graduating college next semester and I really never thought I would make it this far. I lost all hope for myself, and my life just 6 months ago. I’m slowly regaining and trying to find something that I’m passionate about, and I think I want to work for the CDC as an epidemiologist/in public health research to help make the world a slightly better place.

All my life I told my mom I wanted to be a dentist, and that’s all she brags about to her coworkers. She’s foreign, so she was always extra hard on me in regards to school. She doesn’t believe mental illness is a real thing. To her, if it’s not medical/dental school it’s stupid and pointless. My intended career apparently doesn’t offer a high enough salary to her.

Having depression, my values have shifted so much, that I don’t care about status, a nice house, or having a Porsche. I just want to own a tiny little house with a dog. I just want to do everything in my power to be happy. To exist, and survive.

We had a falling out at work (we work together). I help her out with housekeeping because she takes a heavy workload and I do it out of kindness. She kept telling me how I should go to dental school. I told her that I wanted to kill myself. She said she wants to see me try. She said that I brought the depression upon myself. And that maybe I’m the problem, and that’s why things have been going wrong. I got in an uber and left.

In my mind, I was starting to become happy again, making good decisions. But I question who I’m living for? I feel like such a loser all the time already, and disappointing her hurts, she reinforces my negative feelings about myself. I just want to know how to gain financial independence from her, since she pays for my schooling, bills, rent, etc while I’m in school.

532,"I am currently a 17, almost 18 year old male high school senior. I’ve had some sort of mental illness for as long as i could remember, but only really developed depression in 8th grade, and it’s mostly been downhill from that point. I was bullied a lot because of my speech and appearance, but that calmed down as of recently. I had a hobby of mine, that was playing music, that i kinda got bullied out of by the teacher and the entire band so every time i try to start up again i think i’m immediately a failure. I’ve been in and out of group therapy since Sophomore year, just recently finishing my last stint two months ago. I haven’t had a real friend or any consistent social life ever and i usually just turn to the internet for some sort of solace. I also have Aspergers and ADHD, which makes me too trusting of people and so impulsive i do many things without thinking them through. In the context of relationships, it hasn’t served me well at all. Needless to say, nobody will ever initiate a conversation with me, and as bad as i want to talk to people, i’m starting to realize i’m at fault for almost everything that has happened with my social life in general. My only irl relationship lasted 3 weeks, and I can still remember the day I was dumped clearly. Those days were honestly the only time i’ve felt legitimately happy during the span of middle and high school. For a bit more context, she didn’t exactly do it by choice, her had was forced by her parents, but i’ve tried reconnecting with her but she told me to fuck off and blocked me. It’s been all downhill since that happened though. My academic life is doing about as well as my social life as of late as well. I am in my senior year, and i only have to pass four classes to graduate, and one is Physical Education. Sounds relatively easy right? Currently I am not going to graduate due to me currently having a failing grade in 3 out of 4 of those classes. The administration in the school including my case manager are turning against me, citing my “lack of effort”. My parents are also mad at me for not showing much care at all for my academics despite them going to bat for me all the time. Most every day though, i drag myself out of bed and to school just to sit in classes like a zombie and go home and not do anything. I get that what i’m showing off looks like complete apathy to the situation at hand, but it’s all i can handle at the moment. Hell, I see getting out of bed and showered almost daily as a huge accomplishment. Nobody else sees nor cares about the effort i am trying to put in, and that i am doing the best i can at the moment. Most days though, especially nights, i’m just crying myself to sleep thinking about what my life could be if i just didn’t come up short all the time and dwelling on the fact that i have nobody around my age that talks to me and that i’m fucking up my entire life, and it’s basically all my fault. This is basically just something i wanted to write to express my feelings and stuff because i have nobody to really talk to about how i feel because anybody who does contact me only uses me for support and then leaves when i need something. I’m just getting tired of waiting for this fog to clear. Any of my efforts have been futile so far. Basically, as the title says, i don’t know what to do anymore, so can someone tell me what i’ve been doing wrong so i can fix it and reclaim my life back from the hell it has become?

533,"I'm wondering if I should just end my 6-year-long relationship and move back home where all my family and long-time friends live. Every year, I question my situation and want to leave, but feelings of guilt and insecurity keep me here and I wish I knew what would make me happiest. Because living back at home, in my adolescence I was miserable, and thought that leaving would make me happier, but it didn't at all. Like maybe it's something that will continue forever, I think the grass will be greener. 

&amp;#x200B;

But back home, I have more connections — here, I just have my boyfriend and co-workers. He's the sweetest, most thoughtful person in the world to me. But our interests are completely different, I feel bored to death talking to him. I don't feel stimulated at all, our sex life is dead and while I think he's perfectly handsome, I never feel like I want to sleep with him anymore. Living with him, I feel like I've lived my life for the past 50 years, and how it will be forever. He says things will change, because he's in school, but I feel like it will always stay the same, him being on the computer all hours for his dream job. I loathe my job, but I loathe the weekends too because it just gives me time to focus on being miserable, that I lose motivation to leave my bed or do something;;

537," Well, I hesitate to make you all listen to my malarkey, but therapy. exercise, opioid painkillers, prozac, and busiprone have done nothing to stop my crippling depression and incessant self-hatred for more than a few hours so I'm doing this now I guess. I wanna start by saying that while I don't know any of you personally, I feel as though I have a deeper connection to you guys than the vast majority of the people that I know in real life. Since I discovered the subreddit, I've read so many awe-inspiring from people with more courage than I could even dream of having. You're all amazing people who don't deserve the disease you've been cursed with. I'd also like to apologize for subjecting you to my subpar writing; I'm not in a great state of mind. I've suffered from monthlong bouts of depression for as long as I can remember, but since this year it's just been absolutely abysmal. I've got all the hallmarks (I sleep too much, eat too little, don't interact with my friends and family as much as I should, and struggle a great amount with day to day tasks.) That being said, I don't have a very difficult life, which makes me just feel guilty for feeling like shit all the time (I know, depression can come for anyone, regardless of background or socioeconomic status but my brain doesn't seem to listen to logic anymore.) Anyway, about two weeks ago, I got rejected from the three colleges that I really wanted to go to despite having parents that work at two of the three. When I got the letters, I had a panic attack and my mother held me while I screamed and cried. My parents have been very supportive when it came to my struggle with depression but I know it's just a matter of time before they get fed up with my bullshit. I had already been having an awful year and my depression was at it's worst when this happened and I decided that I'd had enough. I've battle suicidal ideations for most of my high school career, and this time, I lost. I took 20 dayquill pills and 12 Nyquil pills for a total of 10,400 mg of acetaminophen (the maximum suggested dose for an adult of 160 pounds is 400 mg and im about 120 pounds). I puked my guts out and had some horrid hallucinations as a result of the dextromethorphan I think, but I didn't die. I said that the vomiting was a result of my panic attack and while my mom was suspicious, she believed me. I didn't get any medical attention and I've probably done irreparable damage to my liver but I didn't die. Anyway fast forward to now and I've been dealing with suicidal thoughts again due in part to due to some other bullshit I'll take about in a later post. Don't worry, I'm getting help this time; I go back home tomorrow and I'm gonna ask my mom to take me back to the psychiatrist and hopefully I get the help that I need, but if the past is any indication, I won't. If this doesn't work I don't know what I'm going to do. I've tried to be a good person I think but all I seem to do is lie and hurt those around me and myself. I just want it to stop.

But during all this I have had an existential crisis on what we are as a species and everything else in this existance. In ways everything being pointless helps me find peace. I start to think where things come from, when I look at a street post I think about who put that street post there, who made it, where did they get the materials. Who got the materials for example. Where is the power coming from. It's pretty crazy that we came from cavemen to all of this crazy shit. Like we made computers, we used electricity and metals and logic gates binary etc to make a computer. Just imagine if there was something we didnt know about, alike to humans discovering electricity. And now look at nature. Look at how things interact with eachother. Look at how these animals survive and the habitats they live in. Its mindblowing. Our world is very alien when you think about it. The fuck is a duck billed platapus, if noone saw it before and you had to describe it with words you would sound crazy. We are very lucky to have companions like dogs cats etc. The compassion and loyalty they portray towards us is unbelievable. We dont diserve them. I'm just trying to say is chasing money and keeping crappy people in your life and caring about the little things is what gets me depressed. I think I'll find inner peace if I can explore and be in nature, help others and be the best person I can be. Yes I still kinda not want to exist because I feel like I'm a failure to my family and I have not found a true calling or passion in this world yet. I know what makes me happy is being in nature, helping others and being around animals so if I can find a path in life that can do 1 to 3 of those I think I can be happy. See the thing is, when I was young I never really critically thought in my opinion, I was taught that this is how it is and I didnt even second guess it. I just didnt really care when I was young. Video games just sucked me up, it was the dopamine hits of winning, of having control over the world I'm playing in, an escape. Now im out on my own looking out my window looking at a beautiful blue sky with nice light paintbrushed clouds across the sky with contrails cutting through the sky and birds soaring nearby ahead, a nice summer feeling breeze. It makes me feel like a part of something, someone else is also appreciating the sky right now. Maybe one of you if you are reading this. It kind of makes me feel like everything is going to be okay.

542,"I am here writing this as a person who has no idea about whether they are depressed or not however I don't know what to do. I don't feel qualified to talk about any matter of mental health. I don't know whether it is simply a product of my surroundings which makes feel depressed as an emotion often or whether it is that I am mentally depressed. I have received suicidal thoughts and self-harming thoughts, only contradicted by my fear, caused by a lack of understanding with time after your own death and also general squeamishness.

I look at what points are often met for a person to be diagnosed as depressed and I feel like that I would self-diagnose myself as being depressed, though when I read through the posts on this subreddit, I don't feel the way the same way in which many people here seem to feel with their problems. On top of that, I am also very cautious about the concept of self-diagnosis, seeing as I fear that it is an idea that leads people down this brainwashed path where they think that everything is wrong with them.

The only logical remaining option would then be able to receive a true diagnosis but that is another concept that I fear. I don't hear positively about the drugs which are taken in order to try and counter depression; I don't often hear positive comments about therapy and I also feel that if it is a matter of the surroundings, as previously stated, I would believe that going to therapy would have made the matters worse. I've had to been held back for protection before, due to speaking about self-harming thoughts, although those thoughts were years in the past and the experience was not pleasant, so I can't imagine experiencing some regular session, which would probably end up by making me feel worse. On top of that, whenever I have talked about the stress and anxiety I push myself under to those members in my family, they don't seem to care. It is not that they don't care about me, it is just as far as I can tell, they don't understand the concept of the mental illness of depression and because of that, I am afraid to go to some doctor in case they ever find out too.

So that leaves me, sitting here, alone, writing away on a subreddit, using an anonymous account, asking a group of complete strangers the question: what should be done? I am not sure what can be done but I feel too cowardly to go and speak to someone properly about my thoughts and feelings that I felt like I had to go down to people who I don't know.

547,"Hi all,

I’m a student in a design course and I just consistently feel down due to pressures that I won’t go into too much depth on.

Title says it all really, I’ve got a hell of a lot of work to get on with but I just can’t bring myself to do it cos of my depression.

I don’t have anyone to speak with about it but I’m gonna see my GP this week to see if they’ll prescribe anything.

I’ve taken courses online to manage it, spoken with Samaritans, spoken with counsellors etc etc but nothing’s working so i’m wondering if medication is the right way to go.

Anyone experienced this and have any advice?

Thanks guys.",0
548,"I find this is one of the main things that made me unhappy was the fact that nobody had time for me, I often feel that in this world that people are just too busy, dating sites are often bad for my emotions because very rarely do I find what I want, usually people are just too far away to even meet and often I just feel people to impact my emotions more negatively than positive because you have time for them but to them you are not so important, you start to question why, what you have to try to remember is just that most people aren't even worth the emotions.

But I find that it's generally bad idea even getting emotional, if someone says they are interested then acts not so interested or is even bothering you, it's best to just to fuck em off and become detached. I find somewhat i've improved my mental health by making some changes,

If someone is less than ideal I find it best to just disregard them, most of the time the connection is ruined by me because I end up getting tired of how they make me feel, so pretty much make a joke out of them.",0

I’ve been struggling with chronic health issues and bipolar disorder type 2...pretty sure I have underlying OCD (obsessive mentally). Honestly at my wits end. Between being in chronic pain almost every single fucking day, as soon as my eyes open, and then dealing with the BPD on top of it. 

I’ve done pretty much everything. Medication....trying to figure out what’s going on with me health wise but my primary doctor doesn’t even spend more than 5 minutes with me during appointments...often forgetting to send medications/ referrals etc....but that’s been almost every single damn doctor + specialist I’ve encountered. Even had this asshole tell me “Blue Cross Blue Shield has never covered this procedure for anyone under 50” (colonoscopy) so I ended up having to do two minor surgeries....versus just paying for one.....and which was a I just recently found out my insurance won’t cover a much needed lower MRI or my physical therapy.... 

I don’t really sleep, I barely eat once a day...I’m in so much pain I slip into suicidal ideation...a lot...I only have my best friend as a support...both parents were cut off...both abusive in their own ways and could care less about my health or what I’m doing. I hate it. The obsessive thoughts are like clock work...I’m literally awake while I’m asleep.

550,"idk where else to go. i realized that my family had given up on me years back when a friend called my mom to tell her i had attempted suicide by overdosing. apparently my mom opened my bedroom door, said ""she's still breathing"" and hung up. 
i don't really talk to that friend anymore. or any of them really. that specific friend stopped talking to me months after we graduated, even though we had been friends for just over a decade. the only time she talked to me again was to unload some heavy shit on me and to cry on my shoulder. then back to dead silence.
my other friends, idk. i know it's hard to keep in touch after graduating, and I'm still in the dead group chat (there might be a small conversation like once a month), but nobody actually checks in anymore. they used to. and i used to hate that i made them feel like they had to, i used to feel bad that they'd take their time out for me. but now the only personal relationships i have are at work, and the second we're off the clock we're like strangers again.
my family doesnt text either. 

if i died today, nobody would even know. 

my roommate has his own shit going on, but he doesnt care either. the only time he texts me is when i haven't gotten to the fucking dishes yet. we're literally home together right now and he hasn't spoken a word to me all day. or all week really.

Finished and proceeded to do things to kill time til I went to see her, came over, and I was told she didn't want to be in a relationship with me after almost 2 years, and I wasn't even offered so much as an explanation.

Everybody who has asked me how I'm doing given everything, I have just told that I'm okay, that it's not as hard as I thought it would be. I've been lying to myself and them every time and I don't know why.

I don't know what to do, I don't know how to feel and I'm just a husk, functioning on the assumption that people don't want to see a sad wastoid. This post is just to say that I'm not okay, and to not lie to somebody about this for once in my fucking life. ",0

557,"My depression and anxiety has really flared up recently so I thought I'd try to vent by posting here.

I'm almost 32 and I really don't feel like I've accomplished much in my life...
I'm seeing more friends around my age get married and have kids and I really struggle to actually feel happy for them. I try my best to encourage and congratulate people but can't help feeling jealous.

I work as a bartender which I love but I'm barely making enough money to get by.

I can't help thinking about what I call 'My old life' around 3 years ago. I was living in a great sharehouse, had an amazing supportive girlfriend who who loved me unconditionally and a great income.

Through a period of drugs and border-line psychosis I lost it all as well as bunch of friends with my last resort being to move back home to reset.

My ex and I talked about having children - she barely speaks to me any more and I sometimes feel like I missed my only chance at real love.

I tried to kill myself around Xmas 2 years ago and I think about suicide a lot as I don't feel like my life is going anywhere...

Getting the motivation to do most things is difficult for me and I don't take care of myself as much as I probably should.

All of this is starting to bleed into my working life too which frightens me as I've been fired 3 times in the last few years and each time it has taken a huge toll on me mentally and emotionally.

I'm not sure what I'm expecting by writing all of this but thought at least the process might be cathartic.

Youngest person there was a woman in her mid 30’s. Going to this support group was one of my last options in making friends or at least getting to socialize with people my age. 
I’ve been isolated at home for years now because of my social anxiety and depression and I can’t work nor go to school. I lost my friends from high school years ago.

She recalls everything in a dark and miserable way about our relationship and says she isn't sure if she ever loved me (she used to tell me she loved me all the time). I know this is partly due to her mental health and stresses in her life but did I have any hope of even seeing her again? I really want her back in my life.

I don't know what to say. I saw that you had updated your Facebook picture and I thought it was pretty. It was on my feed. As I scrolled a single tick, I saw all the comments. You died a month ago, and your parents picked to display what I assume was their favorite photo of you. 

I remember meeting you playing neopets when we were both ten, around 2005. I remember logging on in 2011 and sending you a random mail to see if you were still around. You sent me your Facebook link.

We had such a unique friendship. How many people are friends with people they met on Neopets? You and I always shared dark humor memes. Depression memes. You and I wished each other happy birthday every year.

On mine last year, you wished me a happy birthday. You called me family. I didn't respond. I just didn't see it. I'm so, so sorry that I didn't even like it. Didn't leave a comment. It seems so small but it's all I can focus on right now. The only solace I have is that it seems like your last few months were great. 

Cancer is a fucking bitch. It's bullshit. You were an amazing person, and I can't tell anyone I know. Because you were from a different state. I can't mourn with your friends because I don't know them.

566,"Hello, I am a 21 year old undergraduate student going to a large University with around 40000 fellow undergrad students. Im making this post because I have never truly expressed how I feel to anyone ever in my lifetime, and I am hoping that telling you guys anonymously will help me in some way. I hate talking about my problems because when I think them through, they seem like first world problems that my parents would dismiss as me being ungrateful for what I have. My parents are extremely hard working immigrants from a rough urban environment that moved to a great suburb with great schools and great communities. My mother is a doctor and she is the reason why I want to become a physician. Since my mom is a doctor, my family has more than enough money to support me through college. My parents are paying for my whole education, they bought me a decent car, and they even give me some money to spend for fun. However, I cannot manage to be happy for longer than a few days. I feel like a fraud to my parents. Whenever they call, I tell them that I am doing well, and that everything is fine. I am studying for my MCATs now and my scores have been dropping for the past weeks and I can't do anything about it. I try to study, but I can only get 3-4 hours on a good day because I cannot get out of my bed before 1 even if I wake up at 8. I just lay and try to sleep more. I have no motivation to do anything other than sleep or look at social media on my phone. When I get to study, the negative thought patterns emerge. Whenever I get a question wrong, I worry about how if I can't get it now, I wont get it right on the real exam. I start to imagine myself calling my parents to let them know that I love them and that I have let them down before I commit suicide in some fashion. I feel weak all the time, but everyone else thinks that I am some type of superhero. I make jokes in class, and people think I am this funny, well adjusted student who is achieving his goals and is going to claim his destiny, but this is far from reality. A good portion of my jokes are some sort of depression or suicide joke. I joke with my friends that if I don't do well on my MCAT that I will jump off a bridge, and although these jokes are jokes, I cannot help but think that there is some truth in them. People ask me if I'm ok and I just laugh it off and assure them that I am fine. 

&amp;#x200B;

I have this paralyzing fear that one day everyone will know how much of a fraud I am. I fear that when I get rejected from med schools people will think less of me and value me less. I recognize that most of this is projection, and that I will value myself less, as my parents always tell me that they will love me no matter what, but I cannot stop these thoughts. I recognize that my parents do so much for me, and I feel like I will disappoint my parents for not living up to their expectations. I just want to make my great parents proud, and live a healthy and worthwhile life. But every day, I think that this idealized future is some fantasy that will never be achieved. 

&amp;#x200B;

In addition to my academic problems, I have even deeper social problems. I am 21 and have never had a girlfriend or any significant other. I have problems making new friends or really not acting like some weirdo that cannot hold a normal conversation. I overthink every social situation to the point that once I start talking to someone that I don't know, I desperately hope that the conversation ends quickly. This has harmed my relationship with my parents, especially my dad. My father is this handsome, well built, extroverted man who cannot understand why I have never brought home a woman. We have had fights over my sexuality since they worry that I might be gay. My dad talks about how his friend's sons are having healthy sexual relationships and that he feels sad that he cannot relate to them. This kills me. I tell him that I am trying to focus on my school work and that I don't have any time for relationships, but the reality is that I am a fucking loser. I cant ask out women because I am petrified of rejection. The only women that I really like are close friends, and I know that if I do ask them out on a date or reveal my feelings, our friendship will probably end and I don't want to risk losing the few friends that I do have. I hate myself for being such a loser. I wish I could be like my dad more than he realizes. I see my friends having these great relationships with others and I wish I could be like that too. I am 21 and am still a virgin. I just want to be a normal college student who has fun but also gets his work done and I have come to the realization that this imagined life is just a fiction that I come up with to help myself sleep. I have to lie to my friends about my sexual history so that they don't see the real me. Last year I got the courage to ask one of my friends out on a date, and she just said that she's too picky in her taste of men to go on a date. That was the last time I talked to her because I feel humiliated.  

&amp;#x200B;

All of these things stay on my mind and transform most of my day from productive living to self pity. I don't think I can keep this up. I like to think that I don't really want to kill myself because just thinking about suicide calms me down whenever I am having a bad day, which is most days. I know I need help, but whenever I imagine myself getting therapy or something of the sort, I worry that they will advise me to stop pursuing medicine and try to talk to my parents, which is the last thing I will do. I feel trapped in my own mind and suicide or running off to some far land sometimes seems like the only way out.

567,"Hi. I got diagnosed with severe anxiety and depression. Even got short term disability. Just a few months ago I could do 40 pushups - now 5. so I am 8 times weaker. and energy so low that I constantly want to lay down. I am getting antidepressants of course. 

Recently made myself go and gym training bike for 45 minutes like 6 miles. Didn't feel ""refreshed"" after. so should I go to the gym with all my will or it is not advisable. and I do have WILL. also they prescribed me Diazepam what makes me unable to ride my motorcycle. I can get it less and less, Diazepam I mean, but it feels like shit when its low inside the blood stream.  should I endure to stay away from it will it get better eventually like hangover? motorcycle is my life

1.) call his grandma and ask to speak with him for a minute, and tell him not to contact me for a couple months

2.) only tell his grandma

3.) stay silent and get rid of the problem and hope he doesnt contact me within that time

569,"We are depressed because of the internet. Think about it, on the internet we're always bombarded with stories about how the economy is going to crash, climate change is going to end the world, etc. The internet isolates us socially as well, we're always checking our phones. This week whenever I go to work, school or social activities, I always leave my phone in the car. And this week my mental health has greatly improved. 

And yes, they are other issues making us depressed like unaffordable housing, healthcare, etc. But in my situation, I don't have to worry about paying for housing, food, college, etc. Because I'm from an upper middle class family that let's me live with them rent free and are ok with the fact I'm transgender. I also have great health insurance. I shouldn't be depressed because of everything I have.

It’s like how playing pickup basketball is fun but training for it is fucking boring. I understand you have to fall in love with the process and not expect things to be easy. I don’t expect things to be easy, I just wish it was more natural maybe. It feels like a lot of hard work for little to no progress. If I’m not making progress but do stupid things like say “try harder” then the approach and understanding is wrong. I just wish there was more joy in the process.

I don't know why, but hoodies give me more confidence and well-being. Sometimes I wear shirts because of their collar.

578,"My childhood was filled with abuse.   
My late teens and 20s was filled with a fainting disorder from the concussions I had from said abuse.  
My 30s are presenting with silent migraine type of issues.    
I'm having a crazy amount of neurological disorders and I'm scared.     
They have all been chronic,progressive, and disabling. Every few years I get a new permanent symptom.     
I always thought as a kid, if I could get over the emotional side of everything, my adult life would be just fine.   
And I did get over the emotional side of it. There's no ptsd, maybe a lot of anger, but I think that's acceptable. But it's hard to let it go and get on with your life when it has caused permanent injury that disrupts everything normal you try to do. I cannot have a normal life.         
I tried so hard to just make a good life for myself despite my obstacles in my 20s. And on top of trying to not kill myself as a kid, and now getting yet even more diagnoses, I am absolutely fucking exhausted. No one knows by looking at you what you struggle with so they make judgement like 'must be lazy' or 'spoiled millennial' because of the lifestyle I've been forced into of staying at home and buying things online. If only they knew if I tried getting things myself, there would be a lot more ER bills I'd have to pay.             
I see SSDI attempts in my future. And that's even if I get approved. You all know how terribly difficult it is to get before 50. It's a game of begging while they look down on you and tell you you're just being lazy, and can take years. They know they're nitpicking any reason for denial even if in the back of their mind, they know jobs won't hire or keep an employee like that. It's just a stupid game with stupid rules and serious consequences.         
I have all of the above running through my head when I try to figure out what kind of future I have.   
And it's so fucking exhausting.  
I'm sick often, in debt, scared, depressed, and no one can help.    
I can't even own a pet because I am so unbalanced and lightheaded that I can't even take it to a vet when it needs it.    

I can't enjoy anything in life. I have dreams where I'm walking, visiting places, and just living life without the thought of being sick even existing. Even if something bad happens in a dream, I don't get held back from being sick.. and I wake up only to realize my nightmare is being awake.   ",0

My mother doesn't understand that and expects me to be your average adult. She also thinks she raised me well although my brother disagrees and thinks that she was overprotective when it comes to me. If I would have given you the examples of new situations which cause meltdown it would be just ridiculous. I'm constantly hearing that I'm miserable and my mom doesn't know that she had a massive influence on who am I today. I'm helpless and I don't know how much I can cope.

So a week or so ago, I started my ""experiment""; I stopped messaging people first.  The number of texts I've gotten asking me to hangout since then? You can probably guess.

&amp;#x200B;

I've been struggling with depression for my entire life it seems, nobody can really find where it started, probably at the beginning of my puberty. I'm 24 now, and we've finally had the tests I was waiting for to know ""what"" I am : we think I may be autistic, but in France until the mid-2000s if you spoke you were considered non-autistic so I never got any diagnosis nor any help (it was just ""if he has issues, it's his mother's fault !""). We've already got some results : very high IQ, moderate to severe depression with huge anxiety issue. I've had nausea non-stop for four months after the tests started until I finally went to see a doctor and got both anti-anxiety and anti-depression treatment (I thought I could get over this on my own, I was wrong). 

This treatment helped me a lot, made me realize I haven't been alive for the last 15 years or so, made me realize how fun some random things like ""listening to music"" can be, made me realize that my two friends I managed to get thanks to pure randomness are really amazing and made me realize that I have to be honest with them to keep them because they're worth the effort. It also gave me the energy to seek out help and start to see a psychologist. This was all very positive and a ""second birth"" kind of thing, until anxiety came back strong and... at first I rationalized it, it was ""the anxiety"", or ""the sickness"", but on Monday I'm gonna have the final results for all those tests and this time I just can't.

This week, before anxiety came back, I was thinking about the future, I was sure of my bisexuality, I wanted a boyfriend, I wanted to cure myself, I was dreaming of being a little genderqueer or full on androgynous. I wanted to be a little bit childish, very expressive of my feelings. I wanted to find love, I wanted to have more friends, I was feeling like I had to turn the page and put an end to the ""asocial / sick"" phase of my life and start a brand new chapter. I was full of hope, capable of making choices, capable of helping people I care about. Everything was really positive. Everything was great. I was impatient.

Yesterday I had to see the doctor for my treatment, everything went well but this is the first rendez-vous of the trio that I'm gonna have to get through (general doctor yesterday, tests results on Monday, psychologist on Wednesday) and suddenly the anxiety came back, nausea came back, but more importantly, it feels like everything I just lived was a dream or an illusion.

I came back as ""me"", not the ""me"" I was pre-treatment, for the first time in a decade I'm done thinking about suicide, but pretty close. I can't think about the future, I'm doubting my sexual orientation, I don't want love because it would just be too complicated, I don't want new friends because I'm just gonna be a dead weight for them like I am for my current friends. I want to be a manly man, an invisible normal guy and have full control on my emotion to never show anything. I want to run away from all of this and come back to my previous stability. I'm certain I won't be strong enough to do anything else, I feel like I'm worthless. 

These are just too different, it's like there's two different persons in the same body but at the same time they're both ""me"". I know what euphoria feels like, I've felt it once and this positive phase doesn't feel like it but it feels like ""euphoria-light"" and I'm terrified because one of those isn't the real me, one of those is just the sickness taking over and I'm totally unable to tell if I'm me right now and the positivity is a maniac phase or if I'm depressed right now and the rest is the real me. I'm unable to tell who ""me"" is. I've had anxiety issues since I was 4 or 5 and depression symptoms since I was 12 or something like that : ""me"" and ""not me"" are insanely blurry, it's impossible for me to see which part is me in my current state.

&amp;#x200B;

I just want to be ""me"", whatever that means, whoever that is, but I've no clue who this individual is and I don't know if I can become him or what I would need to do to do it. And even if I did, I don't know if that guy is likable, or interesting, or has a life worth living, I'm just lost and have no clue what to do. 

And the worst thing is : tonight one my friend is going to come on messenger to talk, and just talking to her is going to make me feel better and I'm going to go back to being positive and confident and all of that and I'm gonna be convinced that this is the real me and what I'm feeling right now is depression, and tomorrow I'm gonna wake up and I'm gonna feel like I'm feeling right now, and start this entire loop again. I need this to stop, I can't deal with this anymore. ",0

Process

Giving up is
Never an option

Three times.... 

Never again

Its something that
Keeps me kind

Maybe it's also

As I want to 
Prevent others

603,"Hi All. I wanted to share this with anyone struggling. If you can relate at all I hope you never give up on yourself.

I began to experience depression in my teens for a myriad of reasons I won't go into and only recognised as i got older.

At times it got very dark for me. But at some of my lowest moments it was the love I knew my father had for me that kept me going.

Last year I lost my dad.

I thought this would destroy me. 

I have recognised that I am immensely sad and heart broken but not depressed.

Because now I refuse to stay in bed all dark or hide myself from others. I get up and I do the things that will make me feel good about myself.

Eating right.

Going for a walk.

Dressing well.

Presenting myself as I want to.

It's a journey but I believe that I set myself a goal to succeed.

I made a promise to myself that in 3 years, when I turn 33 (which is fast approaching later this year!!!) I will be happy.

That's it. That's my goal.

I will tick off every box to achieve it.

I will no longer look in the mirror and hate what I see.

I will no longer feel less than or that my voice doesn't matter.

Anything that stopped me feeling good about myself I am working on and addressing.

One of the challenges for me was this feeling of being lost, not good enough and having just thrown away my life. Regrets tortured me. I held onto resentment, anger and blame.

I have to let those go.

I started to do little things for me.

And if you are suffering, please do the same. Indulge in anything that is just for you. No one else, no approval, just you.

Take an hour or even a half an hour each day to proactively have some me time.

Maybe use it to have a facial, to write, to draw, to exercise. Whatever brings you any sense of joy add it into your daily routine to ALWAYS do something POSITIVE for you.

Indulge yourself and be nice to yourself. Don't feel guilty for doing it. It can be big or small. But do it. 

You deserve it.

I also started going to sleep listening to positive affirmations and I have to say, I see it working.

I have spent months now torturing myself over not knowing what to do with my life and not trusting myself and doubting myself.

I almost signed up for (another) random course as a knee jerk panic reaction.

But instead I took the time to think about it all and I spoke to a person in the (online) to college and she helped me out and now I've decided to make a POSITIVE investment in myself.

It feels great and I know there is challenge because I have work to do but my attitude is changing and I'm so fucking happy I made this decision.

I know my father (and mother) always believed in me. Even when I (privately) felt very lost and did not believe in myself. Now that my best friend is gone physically, I know that it's time for me to keep his legacy going and believe in myself.

To round it out what I'm saying is, no matter now hard it gets. No matter how low you get never be hard on yourself and NEVER give up on yourself.

Be kind to you. Treat yourself. Do good things for you, I did just a little change here and there gradually and now after so much work it's starting to pay off.

Seriously, please I know how tough this illness can be but you hold on there. There is a light at the end of the tunnel and your life is so important, you are so important. Enjoy it.

Enjoy being you.

604,"10 years ago, I was living in Manhattan, lying in bed all day feeling upset that I'd never had a boyfriend.

I've lived in different countries since then, but I've recently come back to Manhattan and I'm lying in bed with the exact same situation.

I rarely leave the house.  In the past I did go to museums, Central Park, and art galleries around twice a week with friends, the rest of the time I'd sulk at home.  Now I sulk at home all the time.  Back then I was living in an apartment building with lots of newcomers to NYC so it was easier to make friends.  Now I can't really be bothered since I struggle to leave the house at all.

I felt that I was wasting my life with this wonderful city but doing nothing but rotting in bed but my unfulfilled desire of having a boyfriend really got to me - it still does now.  I've been diagnosed with severe depression and put on antidepressants, with the psychiatrist finally giving up and telling me to just get a boyfriend.

If I had that lovely feeling of knowing someone cared about me romantically, I'd love my life here in the City.  I'd dress up, enjoy the shops, the cafes, Central Park, the museums, and I'd adore just walking around.  I'd be full of energy to match that of the City itself.

It's true that I can do this on my own. The problem is I'm too depressed to even get out of bed.

Once a guy said he liked me (turned out it was a prank). Before I found out it was a prank, I had the motivation to not only leave the house, but go places.  It was so different.  Having a boyfriend wouldn't solve all my problems, but it would make things better knowing that he is there in my life.

By the way I have put myself out there by asking out and getting rejected by 95 guys.  So right now my hope is to be happy alone.

Here's an example of my ""friend""'s response to me when I told her I'm trying to accept and make the most of being single.  I told her it's possible to be happy alone like Isaac Newton and Mother Theresa and that I hope one day I'll get there.  This was her response

The fact that you have to be alone because no one loves you is much more sad than someone who doesn't need to make any effort being loved, not just for sex, and gets it all anyway. I mean it must make you feel much better comparing yourself to iconic people like the ones you've listed (yeah, some born in the 16th century or whatever) even though you're certainly nothing like them at all.",0
605,"I'm a 30 year old female living at home with my father. No job, no career, no friends, no life. 

How did I get here? This is my story. 

I was doing very well a year and a half ago. I had a well paid job, living alone and in the city of my dreams. I wasn't happy with my job, but it paid the bills and I found ways to do things outside of work. I've always been an introvert, so I would spend most days exploring the city alone and exploring random restaurants and cafes. 

&amp;#x200B;

One day, I got fed up with my corporate job and decided to move overseas to work on a business venture. It ended up being a completely different experience from what I had imagined, and I instantly regretted my choice to leave. I fell under deeper and deeper depression, and ended up pulling almost all of my hair out. On the weekends, I would not get out of bed. I would keep the curtains closed. Finally, I had to have my family fly down to literally pull me out of bed, and take me back to America. 

&amp;#x200B;

I ended up quitting the job. Ever since, I have been jobless and depressed. It has been 5 months and I have no job. What is worse is that I have become somewhat afraid of working. Even when I hear back from an interview, I am too depressed and scared to follow through. Some days, I go on an application spree--applying to anything and everything in sight. But when I actually hear back, I am too terrified to follow through. It is a vicious cycle. 

&amp;#x200B;

Today I literally speak to NOBODY other than my family. I live at home. I don't do ANYTHING all day. I have no idea how to move forward. It has been 5 months. I sleep every night hoping that tomorrow doesnt come. I have flashbacks of regrets that keep me up at night. Regret of moving overseas, regret of not having a social circle, regret of living life.  I have no idea how to get back on my feet. I feel alone and suicidal every single day. I have no motivation to do anything, but I desparately want to change my situation.

I talk to women, and they come over regularly, but it's all fake. I feel like I just methodically know what I should say, and what responses they'll give me, and what will cause them to like me. My views on women just get worse. The women I talk to don't really know me, the shallow words I say to make them feel interesting and wanted make me realise that I can't have genuine interactions with anyone since I constantly think of a plan of action to ensure their interest in me.

There was one girl I tried so hard to be real with. But she's long gone. Women say they want a emotional man who can tell then their problems and insecurities. But they don't want a man who has deeply routed issues, issues that far surpass their own. She's long gone now.

611,"I've always been pretty depressed, but it's never afflicted me to a dangerous level thankfully. I found that using self-deprecating humor was a great coping mechanism for me. I could say something negative about myself that I may have been thinking in a humorous way, that would make me feel it isnt true, but now I'm not so sure. After I met this girl last Thanksgiving, who suffers from a lot more serious form of depression, I feel that my coping mechanisms only seem to hurt her. She hates hearing me use self deprivation humor, but it's become kind of my stable for humor. I'm at a complete loss... I'm not sure what to do. I feel like every time I open my mouth I am hurting her, my humor no longer amuses even me, and now I'm back to being depressed myself. 

When we first started going out, she told me about how I was super pessimistic, and I agree with her, so I started making efforts to be more optimistic. In light of this though she still says that I'm horrendously pessimistic even though I have made great efforts to change my views.

A portion of my pessimism comes from my anxiety of future bad events. For example, I dont normally leave valuable items in my car, like let's say a $1000 worth of camera equipment, because I fear it being stolen. She views that as being pessimistic, and in her brain ""that will never happen."" So she would rather leave it in her car overnight for multiple days. Which obviously freaks me out. 

I feel like I'm just ranting now but I don't know what to do and I'm desperate for input. She wouldn't give me a kiss goodbye today, for the first time ever and so I'm really hurt. Hell, I've never even owned a reddit until just now...",0

I've always told myself I cant do it because of the pain my parents will feel, but I'm 26 now and if I have to carry on living depressed/suicidal forever, I don't think it's worth it.

613,"Hi Everyone,

Since I was a teenager, I've suffered from severe depression and anxiety, likely the result of my Hashimoto's disease (hypothyroidism). I more or less lived with it until I turned 28, at which point my fiancée suddenly broke off our engagement (via changing relationship status on Facebook), and ghosted me. This triggered some unwelcome trama that exacerbated my depression symptoms. Since then, my depression and anxiety have been so severe, that I have turned to Lexapro (first 5mg, then 10mg, then 20mg), Xanax, and then Ativan, as well as Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (which did not work as I had hoped). This regimen ""worked"" to various degrees, such as eliminating my suicidal ideation, but still suffered from low energy, lethargy, insomnia, and severe fatigue. Mostly, I've been coasting with my symptoms, unable to make any real positive progress, and mostly work and sleep, and more or less do not trust people nor do I have any desire to enter a relationship (at present, 33 year old). I'm ""functional"", but take no joy in life or activities.

Up until about 2 weeks ago, I was solely on the Lexapro (20mg), until I suddenly while leaving work I suffered a cardiac event and losing consciousness. I woke up in a hospital that diagnosed me with an Acquired Long QT Syndrome. As a result, both my new Cardiologist, as well as my Primary Care Physician, suspect that my Lexapro triggerd this Long QT Interval, and are no longer comfortable with prescribing any antidepressant or anti-anxiety medication, as SSRIs and other antidepressants can trigger the Long QT Interval. While in the hospital, they discontinued my Lexapro immediately, and my depression symptoms have been turned up to an 11. I've been about cold turkey without Lexapro for about 2 weeks now, and I feel it is getting worse and not better.

At this point, without the ability to take medication, I have very little options, but recently found TMS Therapy in my area (Philadelphia, PA/South NJ Area).

I've found two TMS treatment centers, but both do not accept insurance, but can be billed back for out of network costs.

* One center uses Neurostar rTMS, at a cost of $8,825.00 (30 sessions, 5 days a week).
* Another center uses Theta-Burst Stimulation TMS that offers a three minute treatment, or a six treatments for 1.5 hours each day, or two treatments a week for four weeks at a cost of $3,900 (8 sessions, 2 days a week).

Obviously, the lower cost, less weekly treatments, and overall treatment time for the Theta-Burst Stimulation is quite attractive, but I haven't seen many folks who have tried it. For those who have tried it, have you found Theta-Burst Simulation successful in treating severe depression (and mild to severe anxiety symptoms) vs rTMS or dTMS?

Thanks in advance everyone,

Joe",0
614,"So my doc had me reduce my dosage from 300 a day, to 200 a day about a month ago, she wants to taper me completely off of it. She added Lamictal and Seroquel to my daily routine which made the Effexor tapering unnoticeable.

619,"I have been lurking in this sub for quite a while now. Today I slept pretty horrible and while I was laying in bed, feeling like my worst, I decided to post what's going on with me.
I was typing up a different post than this one for a good 60 minutes and had to stop a couple of times because I just couldn't hold it together anymore. While I was describing my situation, I got a bigger picture of it which calmed me down a great deal and I think it made me realize what steps I have to take in order to start taking on the problem (which is depression). 
Of course, it's not the first time that I've thought about these steps and maybe I won't follow through but as I said, at least I feel better now and it also made the possible solutions more seizable.

I will probably post about my situation in the future but for now, just writing it all down has helped me dealing with being overwhelmed by this feeling of being trapped(?).

I go weeks without human interaction, I take a couple community college classes and I'm about to regress  where I was back at university with slipping.  I hang out with my friends once a month to keep up appearances and put on a show that I'm happy.  Only thing I get happy from are masturbating and eating.  Because I enjoy eating I've gained 60 pounds over the past 5 years I've been dealing with these demons.

621,"I don’t post here much because, so forgive me if I am in the wrong spot. 

I’ve been struggling with anxiety, depression and PTSD for several years now. For awhile I was stable with therapy and Wellbutrin 300mg alone.

Then a traumatic event happened to me over the holidays and my doctor (GP) added Xanax and we have switched from Zoloft, to lamotrigine to now Prozac. 

I was okay until this past week. I’ve been on it for 6 weeks and fell into a deeper depression than ever, thinking dark thoughts, isolating, having tremors and lots of gruesome dreams of death. My therapist sent me straight to my doctor who took this extremely seriously. Wrote a letter to my office that I’m prohibited to work for one week and he added abilfy to my regimen until he can refer me to a psychiatrist who would be better suited for me.

I’m sad right now because I live alone. My doctor told me I need someone to stay with me but most of my friends have kids and can’t, some are busy with other plans, and my one friend who was supposed to come stay didn’t call me until after 10 and I was already asleep. I just feel like no one cares what happens to me and I feel even more isolated.

626,"I remember my friend saying something that was really upsetting (&amp; frustrating, for me at least). It was along the lines of “Stop talking about all this death and depressing stuff” when just hours ago she said things like “i’m here for you always, you can talk to me about anything.” Clearly that’s not the case. 

It was disheartening because I’ve always been one to keep things to myself lest I become the “downer” or run the risk of passing on my sadness to someone else or being burdensome. So when I took the chance to share something, and mind you it wasn’t even some incredibly upsetting things on my mind, and I was met with this flippancy + distaste, it felt bad. 

I regretted opening up that tiny bit and now I don’t think I’m ever going to her to express my feelings ever again. She knows of my depression which makes it kinda worse because it feels like she’s dismissing whatever I’m saying and that she’s going back on her words. It feels like people are there for you when they want to seem like they’re “good friends” and “want to help” when in reality it’s just an empty promise.

I’ve seen a couple posts saying we have to pick and choose who we share things with but it’s difficult when you have a small group of friends. You worry that you’ll lose people especially since you don’t have many to count on already. 

But even after all that I’m still very thankful for her and all my friends. At least they try or try to show that they care. It’s quite nice in that sense, knowing that you have the option open.

I concluded that to counter ever feeling like they’re empty promises I guess I’ll just have to not actually go to them lest I get let down but keep in mind that they say they’re there for you.

I am a 17 year old biracial kid from London, My dad was pretty much the main cause of my depression along with childhood trauma which I have never told anybody about in my life. Only a handful of close friends and family members know what happened to me when I was young.  Him and my mum were never together which left me feeling unwanted growing up. Why was everyone else’s mum and dad together but not mine?  It made me feel like shit. My mum pretty much used me as a tool to try and get under my dads skin and irk him. I don’t blame her for this she has done the best she can for me under difficult circumstances. Also being poor used to be really difficult for me. Why was I in this shitty position while others had everything. I always felt sorry for myself and barely got outta bed. I felt trapped in my room and it got to me a lot. What’s the point am I right? I often smoked weed as much as possible to try and numb the pain which had an added effect on my already poor-ish mental health and not really  understanding my place in the world. I felt like a lost soul. People often stereotype black men especially as somehow not giving a shit about their kids which is simply untrue. My mum is  white and my dad is a black British born Jamaican so I guess that makes me a 3rd generation Jamaican mixed dude I have a similar skin tone to Bob Marley.I used to be filled with anger and resentment for my dad. I felt like he didn’t love me at all. Why would he not contact me for nearly 3 years. Not having any contact with my dad left me detached from reality. Better know as apathy. I didn’t know one side of my family and I was struggling to live with this fact. Last night my depression was coming to a head honestly I felt extremely suicidal. I had to do something. I let out my anger at my mum. I have apologised I think I may have had severe manic depression (bipolar)but I needed to get my feelings off my chest. I’m glad I did because honestly I had so much pent up rage I felt like I wanted to hurt someone badly to make them feel how I felt or worse. I decided I needed to let my pops know how I feel. This amazing girl pushed me to do it. I won’t name her but she knows who she is. I will forever appreciate her for it. I phoned my dad. He was at work. We had the most amazing conversation because honestly before this it felt like my dad was dead because he hadn’t been there for years he may as well have been. I’m ngl I got choked up at one point because I was so full of emotion. We talked about everything. From his youth to how my life was going and honestly I felt like I could be a normal teen again.

When being alone, I can't feel anything but a void inside me. When being with others, I'd be more cheery and friendly for them.

Maybe that's my mechanism when dealing with people but, I feel more depressed when people think I don't have depression. Am I that good at hiding my true image from people?

I think they think that, ""Just because it's him, there's no way he'll be depressed!""
""I mean, he's cheery guy. He'll never be sad even though we don't talk to him that much!""

They don't really want to know a lot more about me. Because I'm me. I'm that guy. The one who's always picked last. Who's always remembered last. Who's only given attention when needed.

I don't feel very down about this though, because after this, I'll be finishing high school and go away from that miserable excuse of a school and go to college. A fresh start at least.

Btw, this is just me opening up a bit. I've thought about suicide and the temptation, but I've never act upon it. It was and always will be a thought. There's too many things I'm looking forward to to give up right here right now.

I guess I'm socially depressed. I don't know any of that though. I'm just guessing.

Edit: Almost forgot. Can anyone give me some pointers on how I deal things? Maybe a few words of advice would help.",0

648,"For as long as I can remember I’ve been depressed, I’m not sure if I have *depression* or if I’m just kinda a sad person, I’ve struggled with life and self image issues and confidence and just generally being melancholic but I think pretty much everybody can relate to that. At particularly stressful times in my life I’ve found myself experiencing dissociation and intrusive thoughts of suicide but have never actually wanted to die, just sort of a little voice in the back of my head saying “yeah fuck all this noise it’d be pretty neat if this was all over” but that was always just a passing thought that I never thought further into. Recently though I went through a breakup and I found myself completely floored, I have no energy whatsoever yet I’m filled with this feeling of complete frustration with where I am in life. I’m barely sleeping and when I finally do, I almost always wake up from a horrible nightmare whereas usually I don’t dream at all. I have of course been pushing myself harder than I ever have to change my situation, I’ve been eating really healthily, I’ve been exercising a fuck ton, I’ve read like a thousand pages of ‘self help’ books and applying for loads of jobs and apprenticeships. Basically my life seems to be completely on track but for some reason my emotional well-being seems to be completely plummeting, I still feel that constant frustration, I sill feel sad about everything, but more than anything I’m tired, I’m sick of being unhappy and I hate myself for being the way that I am. When I’m not actively distracting myself a lot of the time I start fantasising about jumping off a bridge or something, the idea that in an instant all of my pain and sadness would be over is incredibly appealing. Again, I know for a fact that I’m never going to act on these thoughts, but are these thoughts something I should see a doctor about regardless?

I didn’t intend for this to be so long so thank you if you managed to read through it, any advice would be appreciated.",0
649,"I [25M] really just don’t know what to do anymore. I feel like every aspect of my life is just another thing to “get through” without any of the rewards or satisfaction waiting at the end. Nothing I either personal or professional levels.

I’ve never had a girlfriend, had sex, been kissed, really anything of an level of intimacy, so I’m alone on that front. I had a decent bunch of friends from high school but only one left after one left just last week to start a new job in another state. The only one I “have left” is a girl that I’m in love with that I know doesn’t feel the same and honestly hanging out with her just makes me feel worse because of it. So I basically have no friends anymore.

I work in the literal job that I always swore I’d never do and would count myself as a failure if I wound up in it: insurance. I basically directly work for everything I hate about society. They pay me just enough to where I don’t feel like I can leave and find something equivalent, yet not enough to make me feel valued or like I can fully support myself yet. I live at home with my parents as I always have, so my life is just an endless cycle of wake up, go to work, waste away for 8 hours, go to the gym (I still like to delude myself into thinking if I look better I’ll be able to get a gf), come home for dinner, go to bed.

I feel stuck and I feel like every time I think it can’t get worse, it does. Whether it’s a shit day at work or getting a speeding ticket or my favorite team playing like garbage or something way worse like a family death, it just never seems to end. I keep waiting for something to turn and anything good to happen, and it never does. I’m at the point in my life where I don’t know how to fix my social issues and lack of experience, and I also lack the experience and abilities to find a different job, so I genuinely don’t know what to do except feel worse and let another tiny piece of me die every day.

Three things keep me from offing myself: I’m too much of a wimp to do it, I actually care about how it would destroy my parents, and I’m an atheist so I don’t think I’m going “somewhere better” at the end, just fading away into nothingness.

I don’t even have a question here. I’m just at a loss as to what to do next. I feel like I can’t do anything, not even give up on it all. So instead I just go through the motions and exist. That’s it. If you read this, sorry for wasting your time.

651,"I know that feeling inside of you. The one that makes you not wanna talk to people, the one that doesn't let you go out despite feeling lonely, the one that makes you look at the mirror and call yourself a useless being, the one that makes you feel tired all the time, the one that sucks fin out of things you like doing, the one that makes you feel alone in a room full of people, the one that makes you not trust anyone. I know it. I know that it's not a good feeling. I know you want to vent. Vent it out !! Let it out if your system. What's worse than dying and never being able to tell your story ? 

Tell it to everyone. Open your heart and let those thoughts you have been bottling up for so long out. Cry your heart out till you have no more tears. Be terrible at stuff. It's ok if you are doing not as good as your friends. It's ok if finding a job is difficult in the current economic conditions.

 It's ok if you don't like the way you look. I don't believe you look bad. You are unique and beautiful in your own way. The way you smile warms my heart. The way you feel sad sometimes makes me want to reach out and hug you. To give you my time, my love and my heart. I love it when you talk about things that interest you. I like that you are passionate about things. I love the way you feel emotion with every task you do. I am so proud of you, as to how you carry yourself on everyday despite all the dark days. I feel motivated looking at you and I feel that I should take a look at you and not feel sad myself. I love that your hobbies  are unique. I love your stories. I don't mind that you sometimes add a little bit of lies to your stories sometimes. We all do that but we are just too vain and scared to admit it ;)

I know you want to be loved and I know that you wanna have friends who can say that they understand you. It's not selfish of you to expect that. It's normal. It's completely normal !!!

652,"The title pretty much summarizes it.

A few months ago, I was in a terrible depressive episode and was on the verge of killing myself. At the last minute, when I was writing my suicide note, I realized that I didn't want to go through the physical pain of dying. I knew I needed help so I texted my professor and he talked me out of it. He was very kind throughout it all. He was the person I confided in eversince and basically the only person I trusted in for a long time.

One night, I relapsed and drank a few bottles of beer. I've been feeling guilty about becoming a burden to him and I wondered if he would stop helping me if he knew I was an atheist (He's an orthodox Christian). I ended up drunk-texting him and went on a rant. Apologized because I've become a burden to him and all that jazz. 

He began quoting the bible and, frankly, I became annoyed. I told him that I was an atheist. I told him I respected his beliefs, but ""I can't listen to any more of this. I can't be helped by something I don't believe in."" He told me it was alright, that he also respected my beliefs...

""But...""

There's always a ""but"", isn't there?

He then went on a rant that basically just said depression is a ""void"" in my heart that only God can fix. (In other words, ""God is an egotistical maniac who will induce depression in you until you blindly worship him!"") And added, ""If I was an atheist, I wouldn't have helped you in the first place!"" (I only heard ""ATHEIST BAD CHRISTIAN GOOD)

I didn't bother answering him. 

I wanted to swear at him. I wanted to tell him that depression is a mental illness, not a lack of religion. I wanted to tell him that I was literally SICK and all he could tell me was this. Fuck, a million words couldn't sum up what I wanted to tell him.

Instead, I thanked him for his time, and didn't speak to him again.

656,"Quantum immortality is a theory but I swear I've experienced it so I feel the urge to warn anyone who reads this. Read my post history to read what I experienced, I truly do believe quantum immortality is real and my rational mind can't convince me otherwise even when that's all I want. 

I hadn't even heard of the theory when it happened, and after reading other people's experiences it just all adds up. It's very important you know this, to prevent unnecessary suffering of loved ones. 

Think of your life like a tree with long branches, spreading out into more and more smaller sub branches. You ARE the tree: roots, trunk, and branches. You are always the tree, BUT you're limited to experiencing the single subjective experience of each tree branch, moving further and further from source (the tree itself). And every little decision you consciously and unconsciously make, two paths split off from each other into two branches (if the universe has infinite possiblities then what can happen will happen). The decision 'you' make will happen and you will go in that direction of the branch, completely unaware of the other 'you' (it still IS you, the universe IS you) slowly branching away until the other 'you' could go some place different entirely. But it's all still you. 

Whatever choices and thoughts you make will lead you to wherever you are now. And you can't die until there are no more possible scenarios of life (you're old). So don't kill yourself. You won't even remember you killed yourself because the second you fade away, your consciousness will immediately transition into a timeline where you're still alive, moments before it was about to happen but didn't (say in one of the possibilities the gun jammed). And 'that' you never actually experienced it because it never happened in the current timeline. But now your broken branches are still very real branches for all the family and friends that are in that specific timeline, their hearts broken for absolutely no reason.. because nothing changed for you, you're still alive on this shitty planet. 

Suffering can NOT be ended by killing yourself, I wish that for just a second you could drop your preconceived beliefs and your 'rational wall' in your mind about what you think will happen and to at least consider this being a possibility.. because no one actually knows shit, I don't know shit, but I wouldn't be sharing this if I didn't feel like this needed to be heard. 

Literally the only way out of suffering is to find a way past it enough so that life is worth living, because I believe it's the only option. Ever seen groundhog day? It's a perfect representation of our lives.

Im being very careful with any thought that I have now, because I know thoughts lead to actions and actions leads to whatever branch that goes to. I want to be experiencing the best branch possible, and being mindful is the solution. 

If you think too many ruminating thoughts, it will become habit and you will feel powerless to stop them. They're literally just repeated and ingrained thoughts though, they just feel like more than that because you're emotionally attached to them and it becomes a part of what you think 'you' are . 
Think of a very depressing thought you believe and think, ""If I thought this thought when I was younger or even a child, would I instantly believe it and become attached to it, therefore identifying with it?"" Of course not, it's just a passing thought at the time and that's all it is. It goes away. Letting go of these ingrained beliefs are hard but completely worth it, otherwise you're just choosing to experience a shit reality when the potential is ALWAYS there, just waiting to be unlocked by YOU.

Past few years I was mentally getting worse and worse and after that I was depressed almost every single day. A few very hard mental breakdowns. And then the worse mental breakdown I had. I was very badly depressed for a few days and after that another mental breakdown. Right after I messaged my friend that I'm badly depressed and that I need to talk. She managed to make me feel better for a bit. For maybe 20-30minutes I was relieved and felt somehow better. Then I told her that I love her but she rejected me. She tried to be nice and all but it broke me apart. She told me why we can't be together but that story sounded so ridiculous I just couldn't believe it. Suddenly I felt bad again. I felt every single negative emotion that exists. It wasn't longer than a few hours but I really wanted to kill myself at that point if it didn't stop. But it stopped. It was weird. I felt nothing. I didn't feel anyhow. I lost emotions and empathy. I felt numb. The morning after I noticed that I can't think like I used to. I couldn't concentrate and everything stopped having it's sense. I saw no point in anything. I did even before but not that much.

I introduce myself, I am a man and I am 23, in a few months I will celebrate my second year of celibacy, for some people it may seem very long, but for me it's just something basic and it's it hurts, I never chose to be single, actually I'm just waiting for the arrival of a girl in my life, while some of my friends are already expecting a child, I'm the single bachelor among my colleagues at work and I do not hide the fact that the atmosphere is heavy in the long run, between thinking that I am gay because they have never seen me with a girl and tell me that finding someone is not a difficult thing, by the way is I really bother to meet someone? I earn more than the SMIC, I am sporty, I am sociable, I go out as much as I can, I am funny, I travel several times a year, I think I do what is necessary to at least meet people a girl, and it works, BUT, it never goes further than the stage of friendship (which explains that half of my friends are women)

To tell you the truth, I just know a friend who is in the same situation as me, except that he does not look specifically for it and waits for it to magically fall on him, but I doubt that by not doing the minimum we can actually meet someone, however, begins his fourth year of celibacy

&amp;#x200B;

I'm 18 years old, I'm a female college student, and got out of a year-ish long relationship about more than a year ago. I had a traumatic past as a child as well as some bad encounters with self harm during my mid teens, leaving me to cling to any emotional/physical affection anyone gives me. He was my first boyfriend and my first encounter with any type of intimacy (I avoided any types of physical contact from anyone including hugs from my loved ones, and anyone around me), and so when this boy came into my life and changed my world, I opened up and finally felt okay to touch another human being. It was happiness I had never experienced because of the contrast it had with my whole life. I never had motherly or fatherly affection, it was all so surreal and blissful to me. I truly felt like I was floating and that I was exalted from all the pain I've felt from my life; it was a feeling of release when I was with him. Before you roll your eyes at me, I do believe that I was in love with him. (Regardless if I am a teenager I believe that what **I** felt was love and if you disagree, that is perfectly okay and I respect your opinion greatly, but I would prefer not to hear it concerning that.) 

&amp;#x200B;

But uh, unfortunately, he left me for someone else in the end. He told me that he loved her and still wanted me in his life but the situation gave me too many shocking parallels to my mother leaving me and it felt like I was experiencing this desertion all over again. I always blamed myself, and I blamed myself for not being more beautiful, for not being more interesting, for all of these things that would make me a better woman for him... so that I could've kept him. 

I don't even know if he's as amazing as he seems. I just know I'm obnoxious, damaged, very unstable emotionally and he found a way through all these barriers I put over myself and showed me what love was and *that I was, in fact, lovable*. 

I went through a lot to get over the relationship, it was a journey in it's own but the wounds were still there and never fully healed. Closure is a thing I have to work on as a person, so I could never 100% be over him. Spare me on this, I feel as if it's important to the story- I guess my appearance changed a bit after the fact since I dyed my hair, styled it differently and started eating right, and ...well I experienced a lot more male attention than I was used to once I was in college. Again, not bragging, I'm just sharing as to why he possibly took interest in me again.  
About a couple months ago, he messaged me on New Years (drunk) telling me he missed me, wanted me back, etc. He explained he was just drunk and his words meant nothing but urged that we should be close as friends again, and I agreed foolishly. I  hung out with our friend group from HS and we ended up seeing each other on New Years as well... I was very drunk at that point too and I have a vague memory in my head of him putting his hands down my shirt and carrying me back into the house because I couldn't walk. I'm aware that it's nonconsensual and completely awful, I do, please understand that my emotions cloud my judgement VERY MUCH when it comes to him so I took it as some sort of validation (so I never brought it up to him). We kept talking for a couple months after and he made all these subtle things and clues of him wanting to be with me (while he was in a relationship with someone else), and I started falling all over again. He finally came over one day and I thought this would be finally when he left her for me. I thought he already broke up with her... so I made some moves, and turns out he was still in the relationship and wanted to keep *whatever we were* silent for now. I freaked out... started screaming, told him to get out of my house. I wish I'd handled it better. I wish I'd talked it out, told him it was wrong and tried to handle it smarter. I'm sure he knew it was wrong. I regret it sometimes. Sometimes I wish I were selfish and just let myself have him in that moment, but I couldn't. I'm no amazing person. I didn't morally decide to abstain from hurting another woman by having her boyfriend cheat, but I was just frustrated that I wasn't enough STILL for him. I'm glad of the decision I made because I didn't want to hurt someone else but I want to make it clear that I am not a good person 24/7 and that was not the reason at the time. 

&amp;#x200B;

 Now, I'm at a state I haven't been before. I've been pushing myself hard in school but the only thing I want is love and affection. I know I have a loving sister and a very close best friend, and I love them so very much, I just want to feel something physical and emotionally satisfying again. (and something that isn't platonic, LOL) I've had quite a few chances with some very decent guys but I keep turning them down because I'm still in love with this horrible person. I can't let him go, I don't know how to. I try to ban myself from thinking about him, I try telling myself that he isn't who I thought he was, but there's a voice always crying out for him.   
I'm guessing I just have to wait for the right person to make me forget all about him, but I'm starting to think that he'll never magically show up into my life like my past lover did. 

&amp;#x200B;

Yeah... I know I'm ridiculous. 

&amp;#x200B;

&lt;/3 love sucks!!! feel free to share your stories below, we can cry together. &lt;3

672,"Every morning, I wake up and take antidepressants. I take them not to make myself happy, but to bring me out of the depths of misery. Six months ago, I made a decision to visit a doctor after 3 years of avoiding it. Ever since I moved to Auckland, I hadn't registered at a local Doctor's office, because I was adamant that I didn't need to see anyone. I was wrong. My life was crumbling around me. My relationships with the people closest to me were falling apart. I was working long hours to distract my mind from the hurt and pain I was feeling all the time. I was drinking more than I'd care to admit. I had never been on regular medication before, and the thought of it didn't scare me, it made me embarassed. I'd known for a while that depression ran in my family. My mom has it, and so do my two siblings. When I found out that my two siblings were both on medication, I told myself that I didn't want to go onto medication, that I could get through this on my own. I was strict in my beliefs - I was not going to go on pills, I was not giving up. 

I soon came to realise how stupid I was. Taking medication isn't giving up, it's making a step in the right direction. Now I'm not saying that medication is right for everyone, because it isn't, but it was the right choice for me. Burnt out from working long hours, and miserable from my dying relationships, I finally made the decision to visit a doctor. I registered at my local medical centre, and made an appointment with the first Doctor I could see - his name was Paul. I was scared walking in to his office. I was not prepared to talk to anyone about my problems, let alone another man. Growing up, society painted an image of independant men - we never asked for help, especially from another male (I'm talking about sharing our feelings and stuff). When I walked into Paul's office, and that door shut behind me, I realised that this was the height of my fears. I had to open up to this complete stranger, and reveal my inner demons. It could not have gone better. The first question Paul asked me was ""how can I help you today?"", and as soon as he asked that, something happened and I just started telling him everything that was wrong. I told him about my miserable work environment. I told him about my failing relationships. Perhaps the deepest thing I told him that day, was how I hadn't processed my best friend's suicide - because I didn't know how to. We talked for a while, and at the end of my appointment, he asked if I would be open to medication - I said yes. The experience of that appointment changed my entire perspective on life. I didn't need to be afraid to open up anymore. I didn't need to be scared of asking for help. We are all human. 

Skip forward six months to now. I still battle my demons every single day, but I know I'm not fighting a losing battle. With the help of medication, I am slowly piecing my life back together. I quit my old job and found a place where I am valued, and respected. I am able to enjoy life more. 

Now I'm not saying that medication will fix everything, because it won't. I still have bad days, but they come around less frequently and I know how to deal with them when they arrive. I may not be able to see the light at the end of the tunnel, but at least I know that the tunnel does end - and that there is light waiting on the other side. 

There is hope.",0

674,"Hi guys. I don't know if I'm posting it in the right place,but i am somewhat depreesed right now. I live in a hostel with some other boys. Some of them fuckin ignore me. As for example,suppose  three of my 'friends'  and I are walking and they are speaking about yesterday's cricket match. Now I ask something to one of them and he pretends not to hear and they continue speaking normally,as if I was not there! 
Look,I am not a very socially skillful person . You can call me an introvert.  But it hurts when someone ignores you,whom you consider as your friend. Should i also ignore them and keep everything to myself and accept this loneliness. 

Edit: I just realised something. I always try to be the good person. I never tease anyone or hurt anyone intentionally. May be that's why they think of me as a weak person. May be i should change myself first and build up a strong personality.",0
675,"My legs hurt like hell and I can barely walk without my knees buckling but I finally did it. I’ve been telling myself for years that I needed to do physical labor somehow, and today I got a surge of energy that was enough to power me through a basic workout routine. I did cut some corners (mostly because I didn’t realize how weak my arms are and couldn’t do more than 7 pushups, as well as not having any dumbbells for one part of the workout) but I managed to go through the workout twice. That’s 2/3rds of the whole workout, which is 2/3rds more than I thought I could do. I never realized how good it felt to finally do some exercise. I’m proud of myself.

677,"The last two weeks have been so amazing, but im so scared of losing everything I’ve gained. I asked out my crush and she said yes, but all i can think about is getting rejected and left behind by everyone. I want to kill myself and get it over with, but I’m too much of a pussy.",0
678,"Firstly, I want you to know that I believe that child abuse is despicable and evil. That if I ever acted out on my strong urges I could continue a cycle of evil. But sadly, my urges are strong.

I wish deeply that I had a normal sexuality, but I'm not even attracted to adults either and that fact pretty much sucked out any joy from my life. I pretty much feel constant existential dread.

However, I do want to say a few things about life as a letter of sorts.

I believe strongly in good, in hope, love, beauty, and acts of kindness. I was born to a very caring parents and the part that pains me most is making them suffer. This will distraught them. My sister is amazingly talented and I fear strongly that this will hold her back.

I'm very likely autistic and maybe a child abuse victim (some memories from when I was very young with another boy coming into my bath)

I grew up reading many books and I always supported the hero to the fullest. I loved people coming through despite the harshest of adversities, facing the darkness to save their friends and become a hero.

I saw many doctors and psychologists and they were always helpful and caring but deep down I know that this can't be cured.

I may suffer from pedophilia but I do care a lot about the world and people. I worry greatly about climate change and the effects this will have on humans. It will cause great suffering both to people and to the flora and fauna of this world. I believe we need to act far more then we are currently doing to prevent the widespread suffering.

I swallowed some pills that I know are lethal (and I took 2x the lethal dose.) I'm feeling hard to stay awake.

The last thing I want to talk about is my great love and passion for fantasy and sci-fi. It truly is a shame that someone who is sick like me grew up with such a true love for fantasy worlds. I could never explain the pure euphoria and nostalgia I feel when I saw a piece of artwork, movie or game that took me out of this world. I always felt a deep longing for the strange, unknown and beauty of these fantasy worlds. I also deeply admired music that felt genuine and took your breath away. My dream in life was to spread this feeling by being an author or an artist but I could never succeed.

I believe the game Abe's Odyssey is what sparked these deep feelings. Despite what you might think of me, I urge you to buy the new Odd world Soul storm game if it resembles any where near the uniqueness and creativity of the original. (And the backdrops of the strange alien planet)

I urge you that no matter what, or what you think of me, Please be kind to one another, please do good deeds and follow your passions in life.

679,"So my wife moved out and I am now a single dad of 4 children. The younger 2 spent the last week at her boyfriends 4 hours away so they didnt take it that hard. The older 2 definitely did though. I managed to get them doing ok, and they all wanted to live with me because they are not only upset about what their mom is doing to our family, but have also thought for years it was bullshit that they have to clean but she never did. Now that she is gone its time to give them the structure and consistency they just didnt have with her living here, but damn its going to be hard. While I'm also angry with her, before she left I pulled her close to me and whispered in her ear to remember that no matter what happens I will always love her. She said nothing and left which kinda hurt but I don't know what I expected anyway. I dont know if she understands that when I say this it doeant mean that I am still in love with her like I have been for 18 years, just that as the mother of my children there will always be a place in my heart for her that no other woman can replace. Before she moved we spent a few days hanging with her cousin and I mentioned being there almost made me want another daughter and again not sure what I expected but she shut me down fast with a comment about how I should find myself a young woman then. At this point we have been seperated but living together for months so I knew having another child with her ever is incredibly unlikely to happen but at the same time she also knows I refuse to have children with more than 1 woman. Now with her officially moved out I just need to find the strength to not lay on bed crying at 2am when I'm lonely and cant fucking sleep.

Today I hung out with some friends and people I really admired, but couldn’t help feel my social anxiety and felt that I was perhaps unwanted. I understand that this thought may come across not helpful and likely not true, but my self doubt always takes over. 

I never felt I could find someone I could come to, and I always wanted to express my emotions to someone I trusted. I have close friends but I know that I would burden them with my feelings. I can’t help but think things like “No one wants to hear about my sad thoughts. It disrupts and totally ruins the mood and it makes everyone uncomfortable!” (Of course not always the case) I know an appropriate time to be vulnerable with people and I thought I found the perfect time to share my thoughts to my sister. I got dropped off her place because I wanted to see her. 

I hate to admit this, but I’ve always looked up to her. She got me through hard times and looked out for me, however,today she ignored me. I know she is going through a hard time herself and I know that she has her own life now. I feel selfish but for the first time I emphasized with her less. She seems not to care what I think and won’t even let be be there for her. I wanted to spend more time with her but she clearly did not. She didn’t want to deal with my vulnerability and ran to her boyfriend. I hate myself. I hate myself for being selfish and that I felt hate for my sister. That one day I will lack empathy and only think about myself.

2018 was a tough year for me. Cheated on my wife (not a healthy relationship) and I got a divorce. Cut my ties with my family because they refuse to admit that there's a child molester in the family, and I'm the only one who was trying to help the girl. 

&amp;#x200B;

In the beginning of 2018 I had

* A wife who fulfilled my emotional needs
* Loving in-laws (mom, dad, brother, sister, cousins)
* Both of my brothers

&amp;#x200B;

In 2019 I have

* One brother

&amp;#x200B;

There's no reconciling with my family, I've already tried. They sued me for not taking their side.

&amp;#x200B;

To make it worse, I lost most of my friends during my relationship. I only have a few left and they all live pretty far from me. I moved from LA to SF, I have one friend in this new city. 

&amp;#x200B;

I have a job that I really love, but I feel like my attitude with my life in general is starting to effect my job as well. I don't want to lose the one thing that I actually truly appreciate and the one job that is here for me right now.

&amp;#x200B;

I hate my physical appearance, I hate that I'm turning 29 this year. I hate that I am getting old. I hate that I don't want to imagine the rest of my life being alone. Looking ahead is like looking into a never-ending abyss. I always thought when I was older I would have so much family around me. I always thought when I was older I would have a support network. I never imagined myself as the 40 year old, 50 year old, 60 year old man who doesn't have anyone.

&amp;#x200B;

I just wish this life was easier. I wish it wasn't so hard trying to be happy. I wish more people were nicer and less superficial. I wish people didn't treat me in ways that I feel are lesser.

&amp;#x200B;

I wish I accomplished more at 28. I wish I wasn't turning 29 having to start back all over.

&amp;#x200B;

I wish my ex understood that I still love her. I wish she knows that I would go back and try to be better to her, and I wish she would try to empathize with me and take my needs seriously.

&amp;#x200B;

I wish things turned out better. If things get worse... I don't know what I'm going to do. I want to believe that I would have the balls to go out and take the world on. But there's no warmth for me at the end of the day. Every day when I get home it is cold, sterile, empty. Every day when I go to work it takes so much energy to remember that I have a lot to live for, that at least I'm working the job I always wanted. Even though it's not everything that I thought it would be.

&amp;#x200B;

I wish my parents cared about me. I know they love me, but loving parents don't sue you and leave you out to dry.

&amp;#x200B;

I just want to feel like I have people rooting for me. I just feel like it's myself now. I feel like a loner, like a loser. I feel like I'm not who I'm supposed to be, who I thought I would be at this age.

697,"Because depression deals with the brain, I've never been able to really escape from it or forget about it. Over a long term period, it's affected so many aspects of my life: I'm exhausted, I spend all my time looking for relief while trying to fulfill my responsibilities, and I end up not having many friends or hobbies.

So when I meet new people and they're trying to get to know me, I often find it awkward admitting that I've struggled with mental illness. And without doing that, they end up thinking I'm this bland, colorless person with nothing going on in their life.

It hurts because I feel isolated already. People have generally been understanding once I've opened up. But that's not really something I tell people that I only know in a work colleague/classmate kind of way.

I find music has been very therapeutic. Usually when I'm chill I listen to Pink Floyd (trippy, but with a dark undertone). When I'm agitated or chilled but slightly on edge, I love listening to Kyuss. When I'm depressed I listen to Soundgarden. When I'm losing my mind I listen to Tool.

You’ve gotten drunk at home, tired of being alone, and you’ve sauntered on to the pub to try to find some level of human interaction, only to find a bill with nothing to show for it. You’ve sauntered home, getting high (yay Canada?) and thought about your life and how at this moment you could give two f—-s about the rest of it. I am not talking about suicide, I do actually want to live the rest of it, but I don’t feel that emotional connection to anything or anyone, including my family. Don’t get me wrong, everyone in my life is incredible and it isn’t like I’ve had a shit upbringing, but goddamn sometimes I wish I could just... leave. I know I’m not a unique snowflake with this s—t, so I need a bit of advice to push through this hard stuff.

Sincerely,

The Dude",0
712,"It's my case. I only go out when I am going to colege but it's not often because the attendance don't matter. I stay inside I spend most of the time on internet. I have no friends. My family is in another country.I lost all my motivation for life. I fucked up my sleep schedule. I stay up all night and I wake up at 2 in the afternon. Is my lifestyle an excuse to be like this? Or I am just lazy??? I feel guilty. I'm so dissapointed with myself. Right now I have to clean the house because it's a completly mess but I don't have energy to do it, I don't even care.I feel like I don't wanna live anymore, I have nothing to live for.",0

715,"I'm so exasperated that I have no friends to hang out with on a Saturday night. I'm 17, I should have friends to hang out with. But of fucking course, I don't. I'm here every Saturday in my bedroom reminiscing about the past and wondering what my future will hold. I have no friends, you may suggest finding new friends. I can't, not until I'm 18 when I can go to nightclubs to make new friends and to have fun. I absolutely have no friends in my grade and it angers me to see other people having fun on their Saturday night or any night in general. Why can't that be me? Why does everyone hate me? I don't understand. I haven't done anything wrong to make everyone so against me. Why couldn't I be the one who is having fun? I deserve so much better than what I have. I have been through so much shit and this happens to me... Tears are streaming on the face and are splatting on my keyboards as I'm typing this. I just want to have fun in my life. ",0
716,"Ok, so I told my friends about my depression, kind of 80% of the truth. First they said that I was imaginig it which made me quite dissapointed. But then they were supportive and I was so happy! But yesterday, everything changed. They started talking about it and asking me questions in the middle of the street, and one of them yanked my arm and tried to pull down my sleeve, to check for scars. I told her to stop and she threated me to stop being my friend, then they yelled that I should stop complaining if I'm going to refuse help. I told them to stop talking about this in public and they told me that I always talk about stuff like having diarheea and everybody hears me, so they can talk about my depression whenever they like regardless of the place. I was so angry at them and so dissapointed that I legit wanted to slap them HARD. When I finally thought I had support it turns out that no, I still didn't have it. I hate them for what they've done. From now on I will change my behaviour to a better and more happy one, just to make them forget about this subject, and I SWEAR that I will never tell them anything again. Is asking for a real friend that much??",0
717,"I’m honestly just ventilating. Feel free to skip over. 

I fucking hate life.

Everything is disappointing. I’m overly sensitive about everything and I kinda just wanna die. I’m tired of feeling inadequate and tired of being in this body and this life. 

There’s so many people who have been through what I have and worse. Yet, I’m constantly thinking about how shitty my life is and want it to end. So many people would love my position in life, but here I am wishing I could just piss it all away. 

If I die, so does my depression. I just want it gone. It has convinced myself that this world is better off without me. While my logical can’t say that’s true, I know very well that the world will move on no problem and very few would be affected and fewer would actually mourn. 

Maybe I’m just sensitive to everything. But I’m tired of it. Tired of the obsession, anxiety, lack of will to live and loneliness. It’s like I’m wearing all this weight and can’t ever take it off.

I’m currently going through counseling. And hopefully it helps. But all these feelings come back and I’m tired of feeling. Over stimulated with emotions. I feel exhausted and can never rest. I pray for my death every day and night. I’m tired of being the worlds burden and tired of my life. Fuck this life. 

Thanks for reading if you’ve read this far. 
Take care everyone.

718,"I don’t belong, not in the I don’t fit in with my peers sorta belong. I believe that some people weren’t cut out for this world and I think I’m one of them. I want to die but I’m not suicidal. I’m just stuck and I don’t know where to go. Ever since I was young I knew I didn’t want to live past high school and I never pursued anything because I wasn’t going to be around. So here I am, few years after high school crying, and wasting away, wishing I had ended it when I had no reason to stay. Now I have reasons to stay but I just want to leave but I know I can’t for their sake. I don’t even feel real anymore. I moved to a different state after high school so I don’t have friends, I don’t work a normal job so I can’t make friends there. I don’t enjoy anything, or have any hobbies, I work, sleep and occasionally eat when I remember. That’s it. That’s my life. I don’t want it anymore. ",0
719,"Everyone i know could never know the urge (of mine) to kill myself, to not want to live anymore.

im not suicidal. i know i'm strong enough to get over it.

but damn everytime shitty things happen to me i'd be like ""ok,  cool. am i allowed to die now or do i have to life a little more?"" - the answer of course always is ""nope! you would have to live, bitch!"". im afraid one day it would be different. 'cause once in a while i often wonder ""why do i have to live anymore"".

im just tired of fighting inside.",0
720,"I have a dual diagnosis of depression &amp; alcohol addiction. However, I suspect I’m actually bipolar (but still an alcoholic). I have been on 200 mg Zoloft for three years and it doesn’t seem to be helping; frankly, I don’t know if it ever did or if life circumstances were what made me feel like it did. I also have therapy but I only see her once every two weeks and I just started seeing her last month. Nonetheless, the past few months have been absolute hell. A lot of change in my life has occurred and therefore stress has followed, but some other things outside of being stressed have also added to it. 
1) I’m a special education teacher &amp; this is my first year teaching. I feel like I’m completely in over my head and like I’m not supported at work. I’m the only SPED teacher there and am constantly overlooked.
2) I moved out of my parents during the summer when I got my job here in San Diego. I absolutely love my apartment and where I live &amp; I’ve always my own space (I grew up sharing a room with my 2 sisters my whole life). While I love it and am grateful to be where I am, I’m alone every single day and don’t have friends here.
3) I’m codependent &amp; am constantly on the lookout for a man who will temporarily fill the void that my ex has left in me. This turns into having strangers come over and sharing my bed with them for the sake of feeling desired and not alone &amp; jumping into relationships that are short-lived because I’m a mess or because they move on.
4) I was drugged by someone I went on a date with who then took me back to my apartment and raped me in my bed. That was on November 6th.
5) My social anxiety at work is through the roof. I feel scrutinized all the time. I’m afraid everyone thinks I’m not good at my job and I’m only there because they were desperate for someone to take that particular class (moderate/severe disabilities).
6) I attempted suicide last month and was out of work for two weeks. They were supportive but my anxiety tells me I’m a burden. This has also caused great concern for my parents who already have to deal with my older sister (that’s a whole different story).
7) My drinking is out of hand and I feel completely lost. When I’m not drunk, I’m numb and my thoughts are too much to handle. When I am drunk, I lose control and slice up my thighs with scissors. That happened just a week ago. However, I’ve been managing my drinking since then, but I don’t know how long that’ll last.
8) Today I tied a scarf around my neck and tightened it until I couldn’t breathe just to see how it felt. Suicide ideation is constantly running through my mind. 
9) My sleep schedule is absolutely fucked. I’m either awake for 30 hours at a time or I have to sleep for an entire day. 

Basically, nothing is getting better. Ideally, I’d like to make it to the end of the school year and then look into rehab options for the summer. I’ve been depressed for three years and this is the worst I’ve ever had it &amp; it is affecting every aspect of my life &amp; I would rather deal with it all now than let it continue to get worse. 

Has anyone here ever been to rehab for something similar and was is helpful? ",0

My mistakes, my agony, my misfortune, my stupidity,  and my pathetic stupid worthless life just becomes a joke to everyone else.

725,"Sorry if this is rant-y - I'm genuinely distressed at the moment and idk how coherent my writing will be. Also, this is a throwaway since for some reason I have followers on my main reddit account.

I was diagnosed with major depression two and a half years ago after going through a crisis period where I stopped going to class (I'm a college student), found every excuse to cut work and just lived off the couch. I would even order pizza instead of walking to the food in the kitchen ten feet away because it was easier. I gradually clawed my way out of that and got to a better place, but I never really truly stabilized. I just cycled between being functional and collapsing, and the cycles got worse and worse over time. I bounced between a few different therapists, and ended up sticking with one for a while before ghosting him because I felt like he was just applying pet theories to me rather than actually listening to what I was saying.

This whole process (along with a 2.5 year break) has prolonged my college, so now I'm a 25 year old man that's like two classes away from graduating. The problem is that I'm in the worst depressive period I've ever been in. I don't know how to get out of this, and it feels like I'm just drifting on inertia.

I came into college wanting to be a hospice doctor, and I pursued that for a while until I ran into the brick wall of organic chemistry and scrubbed out. I technically withdrew from the class, but it's because I was rocking something like a 40% and that was trending downwards hard. That was one of the contributing factors to the initial downwards spiral that led to my diagnosis, but I sort of gathered myself and decided to instead study history. I didn't excel at it, but I did well enough and had some interest in it. I've since decided to take that and get into library science.

Throughout this whole process I've been trying to live the college dream - make lots of friends and, most important to me personally, fall in love and build a real relationship. I never had any romantic experience as a teenager and figured that I'd have more opportunities in college than I did in my tiny hometown. That was technically true, but all of those opportunities have failed miserably. I've gone out with something like 30+ women while here at college, and it's literally been the same every time. I'm funny/nice enough to get a few courtesy dates, and then they shoot me a text saying they'd rather be friends (which was only true once). I'm turning 26 in a few months and I've never so much as held a girl's hand. All I want out of life is to be a good husband and a good dad, and I don't see a path forward with that. I know that I'm probably being overly pessimistic with it and that I'm theoretically still young, but it just feels so crushing to have tried and put myself out there so many times and to have it end the exact same way every time. I don't even know why I keep trying. It's clearly not genetic, since my older brother got married a few years back and two of my younger siblings are going to get married to wonderful fiances this summer. Maybe like 1% of me still thinks that someone would choose me for any reason other than settling, but the rest of me thinks I was sold a fucking lie by every movie I've seen or every book I've read and that my own unrealistic expectations are the reason this keeps hurting me. I'm not an incel - I don't think anyone owes me sex or love because I opened the door for them. I just really, really wish someone of their own choice would want to be with me. 

Anyway, at the moment I'm kind of stuck in an extended depressive episode that goes back to last fall. I've dropped a bunch of classes over both semesters, and am on the verge of failing the three classes I'm still enrolled in this one. They're not even hard classes; I just have nothing left. I try to write a paper or do my homework and I can't. I want to go to class and spend the whole day in my room looking at shitty memes. I tried to go to my colleges counselling service but they told me that, because they have a wait-list system now, they can't help me until the summer. Well, based on how they calculate eligibility to attend the service, I'm not eligible in the summer. I could find a community therapist, but I turn 26 in a few months and will be off my parents' insurance and will be 100% unable to afford a therapist. So, at best, I can get like three months of therapy before being back in the exact same situation I'm in now. I've talked to my professors and they've been very accommodating, but I know that I'm stretching the limits of what they can accept.

I just feel like a such a failure. I failed at becoming a doctor before even getting close, I'm 20,000 dollars in debt with nothing but crippling depression to show for it, I still need to do grad school to become a librarian, and I'm a complete failure when it comes to relationships. It just feels like my life gets emptier every year. Four years ago, my birthday party was at a Buffalo Wild Wings forty minutes away and like twenty people went. Last year, I only did anything because a childhood friend miraculously happened to be in town and looked me up on my birthday (despite now living here, he hasn't wanted to hang out since). My closest friends are either estranged, moved on/away or about to move on/away, and it seems like I've pissed away my youth. I'm also now unable to keep anything close to a consistent sleep schedule and have no idea how I'm going to deal with being at work at 9 am in the real world.

In what was probably a bad move, I watched Mulholland Drive a couple days ago and again today. There's something about Betty/Diane that resonated with me.  Maybe just the feeling of putting too much of myself into something that turned out to be poisonous.  My life just feels empty compared to what it could have been. There's a reality out there where I became a doctor and fell in love with someone who loves me.  There's a reality out there where it didn't take me eight fucking years to almost graduate before falling short at the finish line because I'm breaking down mentally and just can't keep doing this. I don't even know what to live for anymore. It seems pretty obvious that, as I currently am, no one's going to be interested in me, and I don't know how to not be how I am.  I just feel so emotionally drained.  It feels like the only emotions I'm still capable of feeling with any consistency are melancholy and the occasional flash of anger.

Today was especially shitty. There was this girl that I went on a few dates with a few years ago and we matched on Tinder a couple weeks ago. I really like her back then and had a genuine, surprisingly strong moment of hope seeing that we had matched. After chatting for a while to gauge if she might be interested still, I asked her out and we went and got some tacos today. I thought it went well. She sent me a text a few hours later that I'll let you guess the contents of. Suffice it to say the pattern is still going strong. This one really fucked with my head - we matched on Tinder, so she had to swipe yes on me, right? I thought I had a chance here. Now I'm sitting in my room at 4 am and I've been crying for hours and listening to Pretty 50's on loop  and I just don't really want to wake up tomorrow. My dreams are pretty good about filling in the holes in my daily life, so maybe I'll get lucky and just not wake up tomorrow. A few nights ago I dreamed that I was walking around a Walmart with my former best friend (who moved away and doesn't respond to my texts; I might still be in love with her) debating which flavor of Ruffles is the best and goddammit if that wasn't the happiest I've been in months. I don't even remember the last time something real made me that happy.

I'm sorry if this is incoherent and rambling - I just really need to vent this to someone, even if it's just the void of 4 am reddit. My parents are great but they don't know how to talk to me about my mental health issues and my remaining friends don't know (but probably suspect something if we're being honest).",0
726,"If this post doesn't read well it's because it's my first serious one and I'm currently experiencing some extreme brain fog.

I am severely depressed and this has been diagnosed (along with a tirade of mental health issues that goes with a bad childhood) with a doctor where I go to university, and I am capable of getting medication and therapy when I'm in university during term time. The problem is when I go back home to my family.

It feels like I have a constant brain fog and I'm having to rely on my friends who understand to get me through assignments in university, which makes me feel really bad because it feels like I'm copying from them because I'm lazy. The constant flip-flopping between having medication and not having medication is exhausting and damaging in its own right due to the withdrawal symptoms to the point where I've given up until I can know it'll be constant.

In reality I have had to remain unmedicated and without therapy for long periods of time when I'm at home. And I know the simple answer seems to be ""but just leave"" - I'm 19, and currently I rely on my parents for my rent because I live in London during term time, which is ridiculously expensive. Also, they question me any time I go to leave anywhere so hiding the fact that I'm having therapy is difficult. Also, I have a complicated relationship with my family where I feel like I love them because they're family, but sometimes despise them because of what they put me through. It's a mess and I feel like I'm trying to swim to fight it and do well in life.

Problem is, my family don't believe in high-functioning depression, or any depression besides the idea of ""doesn't eat, doesn't sleep, doesn't move"" and don't believe you can be mentally ill if you are doing okay at university (which I am, but it's a fight). I can't slip up around them and show an unhappy expression because they completely deny I can't be being anything emotionally but well. They also don't believe in disorders like chronic fatigue syndrome.

By the way, my brother  (the perpetrator and one of the causes of my mental health issues) is on antidepressants and has had therapy. It boggles my mind how the victim is left in the dust like this but the perpetrator is given help. I think she's just denying the idea that she could have messed up her children in anyway. Lol.Honestly I don't really know why I'm posting this, I'm just tired and foggy and I need to know that this ends eventually. Sorry for rant.

&amp;#x200B;

Edit: Let me just quickly add that I was going to be away for the entire summer, but my best friend from childhood who I was living with at the time decided to not join university but also not tell anyone about it, meaning that I had no money as I had to support her financially until she told me (had the usual excuses of not having money) and then she just up and left to live back at home anyway.

727,"I am sitting in my room,, alone. It’s been almost a year since I left my job and came back home. In this year I haven’t learned much about the world or the things that I meant to understand. But I learned a lot more about myself. And with every passing day the knowledge about myself, about how lonely I am becoming and how alone I feel in this world is just crushing me. It is almost too much to bear. Almost. It feels as if I am at the edge of a cliff and it is taking all the strength I have to keep me from falling over. 

I knew I was depressed for a long time now. Love, family, career, money, friends…losing one thing or the other or not having someone to understand how I feel. I had it all my life and I dealt with it by being a stubborn idiot with my head held high and it was only my pride and my ego that kept me going. But lately I am losing it too. I feel like I am losing myself. There were times when I googled about depression and how people felt like when they feel depressed and I see articles about how people feel like they were drowning, or the feeling of having the air choked out of their lungs even when they are standing in a crowd. But for me it was always me at the edge of the cliff holding onto dear life. Or maybe I just never had to courage to let go of it.

I had a dream last night. Some might call it a nightmare and oh how I envy them. Because well who would call dying a dream. I woke up in the middle of the night. I still remember it, clear as day. I was dead and I was floating in an empty void. It was silent like it would be in space. But then there were voices. I looked around and there they were, all the people just like me. Shouting, screaming, asking for help, everyone of them reduced to just an echo in an empty void by life. It was those voices that woke me up. Is that where I would go when I die. 

I know. This may all feel silly. I don’t expect you to understand. I type in google that I have depression and even before any real suggestion I see the ads for suicide helplines. Every one of them have the same kind of mottos and taglines just beneath the numbers. ‘Life is precious and we are here to protect anyone from trying to end theirs’. And then I shut down my computer. How would they know when the people in my life who actually know me, care for me can’t possibly comprehend how I feel? You may say I must talk with someone. I did.I told my friends, because my family would not understand how a healthy 26 year old can be depressed. They have their own worries. But even they couldn’t say much than that life sucks and I must deal with it. Well I am and it hurts like hell. 

I am not expecting guidance. I am not expecting help or even kind words. I stopped expecting anything from anyone since when I was a kid. I want a friend. Someone who can really understand me. But then again there is a limit to wishful thinking. No. I am here writing this because I wanted to write. I was drowning in my own life so much that I forgot how to write and that’s the one thing I don’t want to lose too. My passion. So if I can write and the only way is to face my sorrow I gladly will. If this was a mistake I apologize but I didn’t know what else to do or where else to go. But if anyone is listening, thank you. ",0

729,"Hi guys. I have just turned 15 and I have something that's really bothering me. Ever since my parents broke up (after years and years of fighting), my mom started drinking more and more. I just realised not that long ago that she's almost never sober. The moment she comes home , she sits alone in the balcony , starts smoking and drinking up to the point where she seems like shes on drugs. It hasn't gotten to the point where  she can't speak, move or becomes violent , but all she really says is ""do your homework"" for like 4 times in 10 minutes, even though I am doing them right in front of her. Its like shes out of it. She tells me ""go get your backpack ready"" , I go do it, 2 minutes later she tells me the same exact thing , over and over and over again, and when I tell her for the millionth time that I did it, she tells me that I'm a liar and I never do what she asks of me. Even worse, she starts comparing me to my father, when I didn't do anything, just out of the blue , telling me that I have the same shit behaviour as he does. I have been living with her(without my father) for about 3-4 years and I still feel like I live alone, since I stay in my room or in the living room, I don't get to see her all day given the fact that shes in the balcony smoking a pack a day and drinking 4 beers and even when she comes out, she goes on the couch, turns on the tv  and falls asleep at 8 pm. It's gotten to the point where it affects me very much. Everytime , before I enter the apartment I wonder if shes sober. It's really a shame because I love her. Shes an amazing mom and understands me very well, when she is sober that is,which is not very often. What can I do about this. Every time I bring up her drinking and smoking habits, she just starts screaming at me and gets extremely defensive. Please help me and sorry for my poor english, I'm not a native speaker.

731,"I so desperately want to drop out of college and get a no-name job full time in my shitty little hometown. I can’t take the city anymore. I feel so alone, so stranded. I tell people that this town is going to eat me alive, and we laugh— meanwhile, I feel myself crumbling on the inside.

I’m a normal person, I tell myself. I have normal interests, I can hold a conversation, I have a few fun stories to tell— so why am I always alone? Why can’t I connect to anyone? Why do I ache and ache over my lack of belonging? 

I’m only lucky in the sense that I have a doting and loving partner. He’s my everything and I want to marry him someday— but I constantly struggle to pull myself together. I’m unraveling, borderline losing it, trying to make it through another semester of my personal hell. I’m constantly tired, constantly wanting to skip class. 

My private Twitter is just a record of my depressive episodes. I think about posting a cry for help on Instagram every day, but I don’t want people to rush to my side just because I feel this way. I just wish someone would take the time and invest in me, trust me, look after me. I just want one more reliable person in my life that would be willing to stay and support me. I’d do the same for them.

I can feel how I’m wearing my partner down with my constant sadness, but I’m trapped here and he’s over 800 miles away. I don’t have the privilege or choice to drop out as an upperclassman from a financially disadvantaged family. I numbly go through the motions of each day, like a puppet, wishing someone would reach out to me.

I started the afternoon with Nirvana Unplugged while I powered through and made like 50 calls for my work from home gig. Made some really good progress.

Then it was off to the gym for some hydrotherapy and upper body training. “Bleach” played for pure rage.

Conclusion of the day: a Foo Fighters bootleg from a show I attended in Detroit. Dave gave EVERYTHING HE HAD THAT NIGHT in just over an hour. This was a man still coming to terms with the death of his brother....his band mate....his friend.

It was as raw as the MC5 when they played earlier.’

Three weeks ago I asked a sheriff’s deputy to shoot me through the heart. I was hospitalized, lost my job, but today I am a working comedian who just got his first charity gig.

I’m only going to plug one more time. I made a few key mistakes and rubbed some of the greats of the area the wrong way.

738,"This post is going to revolve around my experience in school. Up until 8th grade, I was a pretty good kid. No savant (though I did have brilliant mental math skills for my age), however I was generally an above average student in areas such as English and maths. About halfway through year 7, something happened. I was just.. angry, like I realize now I was a little shit, but back then I all of sudden thought I was too good for certain people and that others didn't deserve my friendship. On top of that I came down with CRIPPLING anxiety. I mean being fretful of the most insane things. I honestly at one point thought that I at one point contracted HIV somehow (I understand now that these thought patterns are associated with OCD too). I began to skip class being somewhat rebellious, wanting attention, escape from irrational thoughts as well as honestly not being fucked while also figuring that I could stop at any given time.

Once year 7 was over I had a friend who needed my help and so on a 1-2 week basis he would call me and we would discuss his problems for roughly an hour per call. While this guy was somewhat of an asshole to me in year 7, I considered him a friend and figured he would cut the shit. Well year 8 begins and he's a bigger asshole than before, I'm already having high anxiety and I just figure that I could stop skipping at any given time. Some time passes and my friend stopped being an asshole and offered support to get to class which was good however I still had high anxiety, writing this out, I'm beginning to wonder if this friend is the root of why I'm currently the way I am. I came to this conclusion a while back and cut him out, however now I'm wondering if it was really my anxiety. I feel like I know he did however I don't want to confront it. It also doesn't help that hindsight can be a bitch, but back to topic I just got carried away. I spend year 8 feeling like I'm not wanted by anybody and that my presence around my friends is not needed as they would see me as the awkward friend that don't want to present, despite having to be dragged to class by them all the time. It had just basically become drilled into my head that skipping was a very easy escape and I was well renowned by everybody to be some mentally handicapped narcissist plotting the second coming of the Unabomber (my sense of humor but also how I feel I was generally perceived). My first report card for year 8 wasn't too terrible but bad none the less, my second went ungraded.

There isn't too much I could say about year 9 apart from barely attending, I began to feel like my world was falling apart and remembered my friend being an asshole at the beginning of year 8 and holding him to blame for it and so I cut off all contact. Though again I'm beginning to wonder if I blew all of this out of proportion. I mean, why would I continue to be his friend. Though again I feel like I'm telling myself that for comfort. I managed to graduate high school by being enrolled in a certain program however I continue to feel like I'm behind and I always will be. I still have all my friends from high school (aside from ones that just drifted apart) aside from that one who I continue to wonder about. I guess what I'm trying to ask is, am I thinking normally? Do you think my old friend had that much of an impact on me? I guess me debating this says so however I really use anxiety as a defence and offense. Will I recover? I actually plan to go to college with all my friends next year but I really don't know if I should and I wonder ""Are my friends REALLY my friends?"" and a lot more which I might spill out over a different post.

(M36) I've been struggling with depression since I 10. I was meds back then (can't tell you how I felt at that age) when I was in my late teen I had to stop taking them because they weren't don't anything to help me anymore.

I've had my ups and down like most people,mostly down but manageable. I got married had two kids and things seem to get better I felt like I had a purpose. I had a great job as a repair technician (computer, phones,consoles). Then my wife at the time joined the Air Force. 

I found out that when she was in training she was cheating on me. And we got divorced. After that everything fell apart the kids moved with her out of state. I lost everything but my PC TV Xbox couch and microwave and car. (By choice did want a long drown out court battle) .

About 6 months past then I lost my job. I just didn't have it in me to get out of bed and when I could make it in I was numb and slow. Even though I had a great job I just didn't have the drive to ""adult"" anymore. I lost most of my friends here in town because they didn't understand what was going on.

It's been 5yrs now I'm still in same boat nothing has gotten better. I've had job after job and can't find my place in society anymore. I feel so lost. I feel like it's not going to get better and I've tried believe me, I've talk to professionals been one and off all types of antidepressants nothing is working.

The project is called Deep Learner. This is a project my and my friends worked on during one of the Hackathons I thought it would be appropriate for this sub. The purpose of this project is to allow people prototype Deep Neural networks very very quickly and with writing 0 lines of code. For now you can only build regular dense networks. It also allows for data visualization using Tableau and you can also save models in json format. Please note this is very much work in progress and was made by 4 college students in 24 hours, so there will be bugs. We decided to make this open source, so you are more than welcome to contribute, I have posted a couple issues on github so feel free to contribute.  We are hoping to expand on it in the near future.

5,"A lot of companies are creating new data science departments.
But everyone has their own understanding of data science.

Some think it is a data centric platform (combination of data lakes , data warehouse, Kafka streams), while some others think this is statistics and machine learning .. while there are othersothers who collectively call Data lakes, model programing and big data as data science.

How does your company view a data science department ?",1
6,"My employer, which is a big tech company, just launched a coding challenge for analyzing internal trouble tickets to find a way to reduce costs by reducing the number of unnecessary tickets. The challenge problem is worded in a way that's pretty obvious that they are looking for something along machine learning, though they didn't use the word explicitly.

I spent the last few months learning as much as I could (I have no CS, statistics or math background) about data science, machine learning and text analytics. I came to the conclusion that, machine learning is not cut out for this kind of task without tremendous investment - in time, money and quality training data. I submitted my solution for the challenge using other non-AI techniques, but I'm still wondering whether my assessment of the challenge was ""in the ballpark"".

Basically, the data provided to us for the challenge consists of about 2000 trouble tickets from one particular support department, including all the notes and some slightly higher quality summaries written by the technician at the end of support. 

Without any machine learning, I was able to tell simply by analyzing the n-gram frequency what the most common type of tickets are. Then based on those summary texts and the keywords I categorized the tickets. I suppose if there are enough data (maybe in the tens of thousands), a ML model can be trained to do the same categorization with some 90+% accuracy, but since the data set is way too small, and there's no consistent and reliable tagging on the data, I didn't even attempt it (but perhaps 2000 is not too small?). 

Either way, the real challenge comes after the initial broad classification. The biggest category (including false positives) from my own method contains just over 100 tickets, and under that category, there are a lot of different types of issues (we have a very complex environment). That's not gonna be enough data for any sort of machine learning to properly classify further. Besides, how do we know what are all the types of issues to even create the classes?

So I again used n-gram frequency to find common topics and again used keywords to classify. Was I able to come up with suggestions on how to reduce tickets? Yes, lots of them. Did I use any cutting edge, buzzword technologies? No. Maybe the management is looking for the cutting edge buzzword solutions to help sell out, but I don't think ML, DL, NB or whatever is going to help us here. I have also tried topic modeling, but the output from that was 60% to 80% garbage. I think I know why - trouble tickets note are extremely abstract, with key information hidden in just a couple of words, versus more natural conversations between people which are less abstract (people don't typically talk like dorks). Lastly, I have attempted word association, but the outcome was  pretty much tautology - it just reflects the n-gram frequency analysis.

Of course I want to win the challenge, but my bigger concern is whether the company is heading the right direction - it seems like people are hyped about ML and just want to ride the hype train as far as they can before it runs out of fuel. I believe ML is a wonderful tool on its own, but it's not snake oil. I don't think it can be very helpful in extracting answers to ""why"" from text data of moderate size. With my limited knowledge, it seems like they are asking to first predict whether a ticket can be avoided, and then maybe some unsupervised clustering of all the tickets that can be avoided, it just feels like there's no clarity like the problem of ""recognizing street numbers from photos"".

However I would like to hear your opinion and you experience :) Thank you!",1
7,"I feel like this sub only recommends a degree in statistics or CS for budding data scientists (I literally have not seen a single person on this sub recommend ""get a degree in physics""). But it seems like most tech companies don't really give a crap what the candidate's degree is as long as its quantitative. Some examples of degree requirements for data science roles at top tech companies include:

[Google](https://careers.google.com/jobs/results/6033539515744256-data-scientist-engineering/):

&gt;Master's degree in a quantitative discipline (e.g., Statistics, Operations Research, Bioinformatics, Economics, Computational Biology, Computer Science, Mathematics, Physics, Electrical Engineering, Industrial Engineering)  

[Netflix](https://jobs.netflix.com/jobs/868431):

&gt; Ph.D. in Computer Science, Statistics, Physics, or related quantitative field

[eBay](https://jobs.ebayinc.com/job/-/-/403/11381186):

&gt;Strong quantitative background with Bachelor’s degree in Computer Science, Math, Economics, Physics, Engineering, or related.  

[Amazon](https://www.amazon.jobs/en/jobs/750795/data-scientist):

[Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/careers/jobs/205743826659289/):

&gt; BA/BS in Computer Science, Math, Physics, Engineering, Statistics or other technical field. 

So it seems like in terms of degree, a degree in math, physics, economics or engineering should (at least in theory) be competitive with CS and Stats people. So why do people here automatically say get a degree in CS or statistics for a data science role? Or to put it another way: why do top tech companies not put as much emphasis on a degree in CS or statistics as expected? Seems like they just emphasize the ""quantitative"" part.",1
8,"Hi all.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm here to ask you a question about what should I do regarding my future (hope this is the correct place, if not feel free to tell me where should I post a question like this). Sorry all if my English isn't perfect.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm a student who's going to complete his first degree cycle in Mathematics. Here where I live (Italy), after this first cycle of three years I should go for a second cycle of two more years. I could continue with a course in Mathematics, but I'm starting to think about taking a course in Data science instead. I'm still a lot dubious about this and I would appreciate some help.

&amp;#x200B;

First of all the reason I'm considering the option to change is because of job stability. Continuing with Mathematics would mean trying an academic career, which it happens to be a lot more difficult and less rewarding the more I'm close to it. I definitely love Mathematics and I could also say I'm pretty good at it (not a genius anyway, obviously), but the idea of basing my future upon a risk (you never know if you're actually going to obtain some good results which could open up my way) and of passing a lot of years through not stable jobs, until I can finally become a stable researcher / professor (which is not guaranteed anyway) is starting to make me want to try others ways.

&amp;#x200B;

And so I'm thinking about Data science. I must say that I like Data science, it wouldn't just be for career, statistics has always been something that attracted me. But I like Mathematics more, so choosing Data science would be primary for my future. Still I want to be sure. Obviously I'm looking forward two things: salary and, more importantly, stability. I want to be sure that Data science would actually guarantee me a stable job. If not a stable job at least a stable career, meaning that if I lose my job I wouldn't have many problems finding another one. Moreover I'm planning to move away from my country and I would like to know how much this could be an obstacle.

&amp;#x200B;

In the end is it worth taking a course in Data science regarding the stability of my future? Can I be sure that by studying this subject I could stop worrying about the uncertainty of my job?

&amp;#x200B;

Thank you all for the help.",1
9,"I have a non-quantitative BS and will start a MSCS in the Fall but looking at my program’s curriculum and class syllabi, it does not seem to demand any advanced math. 

Machine learning and Deep learning courses are available but they don’t appear to have a strong theory emphasis. Looks like math is taught in an ad hoc manner. I want to go beyond the scope of my curriculum.

I’d like to be able to understand the average machine learning paper without spending hours on the side trying to learn maths I’ve never seen before. However, I do not need to be able to understand bleeding-edge machine learning papers. 

My current road math:

**Discrete math (propositional/first order logic, relations, mod arithmetic, intro graph theory, mathematical induction and proofs)

**Multivariate calculus

**Applied linear algebra (perpendicular frames, 3D matrices, SVD analysis, matrix diagonalization, Spectal Theorem, Root-Mean Square approximation, etc.)

**Intro to probability (probability spaces, random variables, stochastic independence, special distributions, limit theorems, etc.)

**Statistical theory (estimation, best tests, Rao-Cramer inequality, multivariate normal distribution, nonparametric methods, etc.)

Would this suffice as a good enough mathematical base (i.e. be able to derive new needed math quickly)?

If not, what should I add / topics I need to formally cover?

Real analysis?
More Stat courses?

12,"Hi,

&amp;#x200B;

Since completing my Masters in Data Science, I have had a number of people contact me asking for my experience with the course and whether it is worth recommending. Therefore, I thought it best to summarise my decision for starting the course, what I have achieved during my studies, and the outcome in the years following. I created this article for Medium but thought it would be good to post it here as well to help discussions as I often see questions about Data Science Masters and whether they are worth it. 

### Why did I choose to study Data Science?

It was the spring of 2016 and I was coming towards the end of a 6 month internship at one of the largest consulting firms in the City of London. I had taken this role to gain experience and figure out whether becoming an Actuary was the correct route for my career. I quickly found passion in the data analytics of the role as I was being pulled into meetings to discuss numbers I had crunched or was able hack together a tool to automate previously manual tasks. However, I also found that the traditional track I would be heading on if I moved onto the graduate scheme no longer interested me due to years of standardised exams and little to no creativity. Furthermore, most of my work at this point was within Excel and I was gaining little to no coding experience.

It was at this point I also started to explore a magical term that kept coming up in my job searches: *Data Science*. I had come from a background in mathematics and, due to the nature of the job market in the UK, had been nudged towards the well-founded traditional roles such as accountancy and actuarial consulting. And yet, here was a new role that defied all the expectations I had set for myself of my future career. Where becoming an Actuary I would be solving problems by learning regulatory standards, Data Scientists are encouraged to creatively find solutions that fit within the commercial environment. Furthermore, the role opportunities were no longer fixed into a few select firms but almost all companies were looking for some variation of a Data Scientist and the idea that I could move into a completely new industry, from fashion to finance, greatly appealed to my interests.

However, as I started to apply for Data Science roles it quickly became apparent that **I was lacking two key skills: applying Machine Learning and coding.**

### What were my options?

The first solution was to simply teach these myself, I had the statistical experience to learn machine learning and had done enough coding in MatLab to feel confident that I could learn Python or R. However, if I was to do these I was unsure if this was enough and how I would clearly demonstrate my newly acquired skills on a CV to employers.

I considered online boot camps but they were often fixed in their content and I was unsure of how repeating someone else’s work would be received by employers. Furthermore, there was no guarantee that these were credible to employers and were expensive to self fund. Today, only three years later, the list of courses supported by universities makes this much more of a viable option and is something that is definitely worth considering but at the time these were lacking. Unfortunately, boot camps were a costly risk that I was uncertain would pay off.

Therefore, I decided to look for the options available at universities. At the time there were two types of courses that fit within my goals; business analysts courses and computer science machine learning. The former focused on applying analytics within commercial environments but, as this was run through business schools, was far more expensive at over £25,000 for one year of studying. The latter provided the teaching through academic research and focused more on teaching the underlying theory than the application. Furthermore, as this was an academic course run through the Computer Science department, the cost was considerably less for the year at £9,000 (for UK citizen).

### What did I choose?

In the end, I decided to play it safe and commit a full year to the academic masters in the hope that I would gain the applied knowledge in machine learning and develop my coding skills through project work.

Therefore, I joined the 2016/17 cohort of the Data Science MSc at City, University of London’s Computer Science department. This was the second year the course was offered at this university and, at the time, was the only university in London that offered a Data Science Masters (though others had some variations of this).

### What did I learn in the course?

The first term consisted of the three main topics of Data Science: fundamentals of data science, machine learning and visualisations. Each module consisted of a coursework component that we were given a choice of any publicly available dataset to apply our newly learned methods on. With these, I was quickly able to improving my coding skills and even built the confidence to start sharing [these projects publicly](https://www.philiposbornedata.com/2017/06/27/test/).

In the second term we had two core modules, Big Data and Neural Computing, and were given the choice of two optional modules. The list of options was comprehensive and enabled us to pick specialisms from computer vision to data architectures. I chose Data Visualisations (a continuation of the first term’s module) and Software Agents (the basics of AI by applying Reinforcement Learning). Again, these modules included coursework and with the fundamentals from the first term, I was really able to expand my applications and think creatively. Big Data also introduced text data and natural language processing.

Over the two terms, I had been given a broad overview of most of the Data Science topics and had a deep knowledge of Machine Learning and Neural Networks from the core modules. As we moved into the first component of the course, the dissertation, we were given the choice to complete this whilst in an internship role (and be provided an extension on the deadline to account for balancing whilst working). I found a suitable role, defined my research topic and over the following months applied all the skills I had gained so far towards [applying AI within business](https://www.philiposbornedata.com/2018/03/09/masters-thesis-summary-constructing-a-narrative-using-markov-decision-processes-applied-to-data-visualisations/).

### Did I gain the skills I needed from the course?

I had two goals to achieve; to demonstrate that I understand machine learning and apply these with coding. The course not only provided a clear ‘box tick’ against these on my CV but enabled me to continue to expand my skills after with more and more interesting projects. Part of any job application is to get past the initial checks and I was now doing this much more consistently. Furthermore, as I moved into interview stages, I had all these project to discuss and truly demonstrate confidence in my understanding far more than I would have achieved on my own.

The Masters opened up all the doors that I had previously been knocking on and even had recruiters contacting me directly following the projects I had posted publicly. In the end, I found that I enjoyed the research aspect of my dissertation and the freedom to pursue the field and have since move onto a PhD in Artificial Intelligence. Ironically, this is the last thing I would have considered back in 2016 but as the field is constantly expanding it is incredible to be at the forefront of this, particularly because many problems require an applied mindset and fit within commercial problems and are not simply theoretical.

### What advice would I give to someone considering moving into Data Science?

This is always a hard question for me to answer as each person’s position is different so will try to offer some advice based on my experience. In short:

1. **Establish** that Data Science is the right route for you and find a topic or detail to motivate this. For me, it was the ability to apply data analytics in a creative way and become a valuable asset in a business to help others improve their decisions.
2. **Evaluate** what the jobs you want are asking for and where your set of skills currently fall short. Although I had the technical background, I had not demonstrated my ability to apply machine learning or code and needed something to achieve this. For others on my course, they had not come from maths or stats backgrounds and so needed these to strengthen their knowledge.
3. **Review** the options available to you to gain these missing skills. For example, boot camps are increasingly more credible in the industry but they are often following a single path (i.e. learn on the same data and apply the same methods). This may work for some but I wanted to demonstrate my abilities in unique ways to stand out to employers. If you are considering a masters, thoroughly research the modules and who is organising the course as variations will exists between different departments, particularly business and academic schools.
4. **Expand and challenge** yourself through the course, don’t simply pick a course that covers topics you are already comfortable with to tick a box. Find something challenging that will encourage you to develop new skills.
5. **Demonstrate** your new skills by publishing your projects online, either through GitHub or Kaggle or your own site. Building a portfolio of project has taken me further in any interview than trying to describe these within the time limit would allow.

&amp;#x200B;

I hope you find this post useful if you are considering how to get into data science and will do my best to answer any questions you have about this. Am UK time so will most likely reply to questions tomorrow morning when I have some time.

13,"I work for a small company with a 2 person data science team. The data we use is not massive (largest analysis datasets typically in the millions). At this point we're still using our laptops to train models and so forth.

2. Method to ""combat"" imbalanced data - same as above but different approach (maybe combine both?)
3. Method for Generating Measurements and Weighting of each measurement -   
This happens often in business when trying to rank/group something without statistical training. They just come up with a model that take multiple measures.

20,"I'm looking to break into the Data Science field and currently interviewing with a few companies, but I feel I lack certain edge because I don't have much to showcase (very little work exp). So I decided to start by working on mini-projects and putting them up on Github. I started with something really simple but I feel like I could do a lot better than that just Excel charts. So here are some of my questions about github projects.

* **The data part:** Do you (1) think of a problem and then find relevant data-sets or (2) look through a list of available data sets and pick one that piques your interest? So far I have tried method (1) but often I don't find data in a desirable formats or anything close. 
In this case, are there tools I can leverage that can collect data from websites and convert them into CSV or something (guess this is called scraping)? 
If method (2) is ideal for a newbie like me, where's the best place to find data to work on. 

* **The visualization part:** While creating killer visuals using R and Tableau is my goal, I'd like to, in the short run, be able to use online tools to quickly show, say, a pie chart or a bar graph (or maybe a combo of both) of an interesting trend I found. Any advice here?

Not entirely sure if these questions are valid or if the expectations are realistic, but feel free to put me in my place, if required. I'm here to learn. Any other advice you'd like to give me about getting some projects off the ground, feel free to comment or PM me. Thanks in advance!",1

**""What are the qualities or traits which differentiate good data scientists from the best data scientists? How, if at all, can these traits be learned or acquired?""**


Panelist Answers:
_______________________________________________________
/u/creampuffcrusader:

The best data scientists I've worked with had these two traits:

**A deeply rooted paranoia about data quality.**

Starting out a project by trying to replicate KPIs and current domain knowledge before jumping into the new and exciting work. Talking to stewards of the data about any quirks they ran into and taking the time to understand the data generating process. This can be learned either from mentor-ship or from experience. For me personally - it was combination of both mentorship and collecting battle scars.

**Holding themselves to the scientific method***

I had a mentor who was a data scientist before it was cool. He started the quantitative supply chain practice at the firm I work in back when the data scientist equivalent position was called Principal Analyst. He had this motto when interviewing stakeholders:

Tribal knowledge is a hypothesis unless there is evidence.
He had this uncanny ability of organizing knowledge by what has been verified, what can be verified, and what is interesting but maybe out of scope or not testable. And using this categorization to efficiently guide us to a quality analysis or product. Really - he was just very strictly holding himself and his team to the scientific method. It was remarkable.

This trait can definitely be learned. But it takes patience and experience.

_______________________________________________________
/u/amadeusmagrabi:

In my experience, the best data scientists are the ones who have **an intrinsic drive to deliver value for the business** and are **able to think outside the box to make sure that the whole team has the highest impact.**

Good data scientists ask their manager what the project requirements are, do their research, deliver a clean and thorough analysis, communicate their most important findings clearly and then ask what they should work on next.

Great data scientists take a more active approach and think about their work with more context. They ask what the larger goal of the project is and challenge the core assumptions. They have ideas for how a project could also benefit other parts of the company or raise awareness for potential conflicts that could occur down the line. They are informed about new frameworks or techniques that come out and suggest innovative ways how they could be used to improve a process. They are genuinely interested in how the business as a whole works and actively talk to people to understand their perspectives. They are full of ideas of what they should work on next. They pride themselves on how many people they helped and not on how complicated the technique they used was.

Importantly, they do all of this because they care about the impact of their work and not because they want the attention or boost their career. They do not start a discussion just for the sake of having a discussion and they are able to step back when their opinions did not resonate with others.

*As to how to acquire these skills:* 

If you do not have a data science job yet, this is hard to prepare. But it helps to read blog posts in which companies from different industries share how they get value out of their data (there are plenty of those on Medium).

Once you have a job, ask as many questions as possible without being too annoying and talk to everyone in the company. Do not be shy and just sit in front of your data. Constantly ask yourself why you are doing what you are doing, if it still makes sense or if there is a better way. Get involved, be curious and let others know about your thoughts. The more feedback you get on your thoughts, the better you can fine-tune your work to the business context.

This depends on the role of the data scientist and the company.

In a tech company where seconds (and milliseconds) matter, then your knowledge of algorithms, statistical learning, and programming matters a lot.

However, if you're in a non-tech company, where data scientists tend to be more ""decision scientists"", and the transactions happen across days or weeks (think buying a car), then the ""soft-skills"" tend to dominate...things like understanding the business, iterating rapidly, and explaining results to non-math/non-engineering executives.

Both are learn-able. However, in my experience the latter (soft skills) are harder to teach.
_______________________________________________________
/u/dfphd:

There are three things that come to mind:

* **They are driven by outcomes and not methods - but can do either well.** 

The best data scientists I've met are the people that are willing to put their ego aside and cobble together a less elegant answer in two days than a more elegant answer in a week because that's what's right for the project. That's not to say that they cannot put together a complex, elegant solution to a problem - when the problem/project calls for it, they can roll their sleeves up and make that happen. But their bias is for getting results, not getting methodologies.

* **They say ""yes"" more often than ""no""**

It's really easy to say no. We can't do that, that can't be done, that won't work, no, no, no. Really good data scientists say yes - knowing that they may need to change the question for it to work, but understanding that they can likely figure something productive out.

* **They build strong relationships based on work credibility**

These people tend to do more than just be good at their job - they seem to always manage to leverage the quality of their work into really strong relationships at work, which in turn helps them be even more effective by having a lot of people who are willing to go to bat for them when needed. I think the first two attributes tend to help in building these relationships, but there is extra effort and time that they dedicate to cultivate these relationships over time.

Learning these skills, in my opinion, is largely driven by introspection, i.e., identifying that your objective should be to become as effective and efficient as possible, and that you may need to modify your behaviors, your habits, your comfort zone in order to become that person. Once you can legitimately convince yourself that these are skills worth developing, the rest becomes an exercise in keeping yourself honest - in constantly call yourself out when you are being a method-diva, when you're being a naysayer, and when you're marginalizing your relationships at work.",1

34,"Do you all have any best practices in structuring projects (i.e. directory structures for storing data, scripts, exploratory notebooks, etc.; naming schemes; breaking questions/tasks into pieces for teams to tackle in parallel)? This is a little ambiguous and certainly dependent on the specific project and/or field, but I want it to be open ended. Interpret it as you will.

Personally, I am sort of a ""hobbyist"" data scientist (I am a biologist; my ""data science"" type work is all on my own time), so all of the ""data science"" type things I do are exploration of open source biological data (RNA seq, protein-protein interaction databases, anything on the Allen Brain Institute's website; i.e. ""data-science-lite""). I'm usually testing out one-off ideas, looking for interesting ways to combine open source data, and seeing if I can gain any insight into my own project. 

I generally have separate directories for raw and transformed/joined data. I keep scripts in the directory in which they were applied to make it easier to keep track of what I did at each step of the process, and I keep exploratory/debugging notebooks in the parent directory. I also try to keep metadata files in each raw and transformed directory, but to be overly honest I am the only person working with any of it, so I tend to slack quite a bit on creating the metadata.

I haven't come up with any naming schemes that seem to work for me consistently, and since it's just me exploring data to see if I can use it for my own projects, I generally have no need to break it into smaller pieces to be executed by a team.

My approach has a lot of short-comings. In particular, I end up with data files haphazardly named and scripts spread chaotically throughout the whole directory structure. I can usually trace my way back to what I did, but it takes some time. This is particularly problematic when I try to return to a project with a new idea; I spend as much time remembering what I did previously as I do executing the new idea.

I'm just curious what you all do to structure your projects. I've not seen much here in the way of describing best practices in organizing personal or professional projects, so I thought I'd toss the question out to the community.",1

1. data analyst is more manual job, you work with business, produce reports, presentation not software;
2. you will not gain right coding practices and you will not be learning about modern machine learning/statistical techniques.

58,"TL;DR: I did a performance analysis of my production classifier and would like to know what's the method that you guys use, and whether there are any flaws to my idea.

&amp;#x200B;

I work with text mining and the most important model that I have is a document classifier. It classifies if a particular document is a contract or not.

&amp;#x200B;

My team created a pipeline that fetches documents, OCR them, classify them and make them available in a web application, so that our users can find them way faster than by using the other methods.

&amp;#x200B;

The classifier was trained with 1K documents and deployed with &gt; 90% F-score to production (I did the training, testing and validation stuff to prevent overfitting). We then needed to tell the stakeholders our classification accuracy, because of that, I sampled 1K from the 33K classified documents and we manually annotated the sample so that we could calculate the number of contracts labeled as not contracts (false negatives) and the number of documents that were not contracts but were classified as contracts (false positives).

&amp;#x200B;

I then looked at the false positives and false negatives for patterns, after finding patterns in the errors, I created regular expressions that reduced the error for some patterns, and re-trained the models for the other patterns that came from new documents that were entirely different from the samples we had in the initial dataset. After updating the model, the F-score went up to &gt; 90% again, and we got better results when looking in the web application, so the problem of performance was solved. BUT, I think my approach to this problem was very intuitive and not very science-y, so I figured out another way of doing this, a more statistical way.

&amp;#x200B;

What I'm thinking about doing in the next time, is to make a [sample size calculation](https://www.surveysystem.com/sscalc.htm) using the total of documents in production as the population, confidence level of 95% percent and confidence interval of 3%. Then do a random sample of N documents, annotate them and calculate the F-score.

&amp;#x200B;

Now, my fellow data scientists, I would like to know how you do this kind of performance monitoring for classifiers. Also, do you think that my idea has any flaw ?

&amp;#x200B;

Another thing, my new idea will use a confidence interval of 3%, does that imply that the score that I calculate after annotating documents from my random sampling will have a range of +- 3% ? For example if I calculate a F-score of 94%, does it mean that my F-score, actually is 91-97%, because I did a sample of the population ? Or am I oversimplifying things and this is not how confidence intervals actually work ?

At my previous position I used a server with remote desktop and it was clunky so I'm trying spend some time getting familiar with a good setup early in order to increase my productivity and workflow later. I'm looking for recommendations on workflow. Here is my current workflow setup:

* Jupyter-lab server
* Rstudio server
* ssh tunnel from server to localhost on a Macbook Air or Fedora Workstation desktop through Chrome
* localhost:8000 to load up Jupyter-lab
* localhost:8001 to load up Rstudio

I generally write scripts in Jupyter-lab or Rstudio and once testing is complete I open up a tmux shell on the server and run code straight from the command line -- I use tmux so I can monitor it throughout without the need for being connected to the VPN. This has worked well so far but it still feels a bit clunky. Ultimately, I think a vim-python in one tmux pane and ipython in another would be ideal where I can Ctrl+enter send commands using vim-slime. I've tried this setup and it works, but the config is somewhat of a hassle and I need access to quick plotting to check data processing commands and model run outputs, which is not possible with ipython in the command line. An `ssh -X` would solve this, but now I'm adding things that seem excessive.

This setup is certainly better than my previous workflow. I'd like to see what other data science workflows look like when using a remote server.

I’ve stretched what should be week to fortnight-long projects into months because I have nothing to do.  I’ve literally had only 6 half-projects since I’ve been here.  I feel like I’m trying to find things to pass the time with, and it’s really starting to affect my mental health.  I like to be kept busy.

Also, none of the data scientists collaborate on projects, we’re all assigned our own work, which I feel is possibly not the norm.  It's really lonely, and I feel projects would get done a lot more quickly if we worked together.  We also never have code or project reviews, so I have no idea if what I’m doing is correct or not.  I taught myself to code in the language we use so honestly my code is probably horrendous.

I’ve tried to find my own projects, but it’s such a large and global company that it’s difficult to know where to start.  When I have managed to create my own projects, it’s taken MONTHS to get the data, so I just sit around waiting.  In the absence of anything else to do, I've been teaching myself web development.

It’s got to the point where I’m really considering changing to a software engineering/developer role as I really enjoy coding, and I feel like software engineering is an inherently more interesting and collaborative role.  Is it?

Is my experience typical for a Data Scientist, or is it just my company?  Should I try moving to a data science position elsewhere before abandoning it completely?

**tldr: data science job is really boring, involves a lot of waiting, no code reviews, and there is no team collaboration.  Is this typical for a data scientist or just my company?**",1

79,"Hello everyone, 

Long story short: I am a Data Scientist that works for a fortune 500 company in Brazil, and wants to relocate to Europe, but would need sponsorship because I only have Brazilian citizenship. Was a software engineer that transitioned to DS and I work with text mining right now. 

I would like to have some advice on what I should focus on next to maximize my chances of getting a Data Scientist position to relocate to Europe. There are a lot of different fields to work on and I feel kind of lost on how to proceed. 

Since Europe is very big, the options that I envision are:

- The Netherlands
- Germany
- UK
- Ireland
- Switzerland
- Belgium looks good as well, but I would need to study this country a little more to decide. 

Any one of them would be good, since I know that relocating inside Europe is easier once you're there, in case I'm not compatible with my first option. Also, I'm not picky about salary, having enough to pay the bills and eating out two times a week is enough for me, I know I can build upon my opportunity with time. 

I think it's important to give you details about my background, so that you have more information to work with. 

### My background

What I can do:

3+ years experience with software engineering before switching to Data Science so the programming, SQL, NoSQL and ETL stuff is a no brainer to me. I know how to deploy math models using Python and also know infrastructure, docker, Linux, Kubernetes, scalability, networking, etc etc. (I worked as a sysadmin for a year)

I am working with document classification for 1 year already, using TF-IDF + SVM + regex rules. I also do metadata extraction from the text (client name, document id, etc). I have hands-on experience with random forests, logistic regression, NaiveBayes, etc, the standard stuff for text mining. Classification is one of my strengths. 

I know how to explain these complicated concepts to business people, one of my presentations to a C-level executive on how word vectors could be used for a problem made me receive very good feedback from him. 

I am responsible for understanding the problem with the business people so that I can know which problem to be solved first to have better results to then solve it using ML/DL/whatever solves it, I also make the decisions on how the problem will be approached. 

I also know quite a bit about sentiment analysis, since it's what I do in my spare time. 

What I cannot do:

I don't know R (it would be easy to learn R, but I got lazy in that part, Python looks way simpler)

I just have very basic and  theoretic knowledge of regression, that part of DS is not used in my job because I do classification, so I never got past that famous real estate dataset.

I also have very basic and theoretic knowledge of clustering, I know it is very useful for profiling customers, recommendation and all that, but didn't get past KNN and K-Means examples, just the basics. 

My statistics kinda suck. I'm working on that right now by learning on online courses and trying to apply it to hypothesis testing in my work. But I still struggle with how to use random sampling, the exact meaning of confidence interval, p-value, F-test, T-test, etc etc. This is one area that I don't feel confident about. 

My math is not that strong as well, I struggle to understand the underlying maths on state of the art papers. But I don't know if knowing the obscure details of CNNs helps more than being good at using them in a practical setting (avoid overfitting, for example). 

My question is, based on my strengths and weaknesses, what skills should I focus on to have a bigger chance of getting a DS position in Europe? Customer clustering, A/B testing? Financial stuff? Object detection using CNN? Time series forecasting ? Should I stay in text mining and be VERY GOOD at it and search for positions in that field? Or should I know a little bit about everything and pray that it is enough to land the job, to then get very good at something ? 

Will a masters in science help me on getting a sponsored visa position? Or is it more about what I can / cannot do in practice, instead of academic success? 

I have a B.Sc in Computer Science BTW. 

My favorite area of study is computer vision, but I don't see a lot of job postings about it.  ",1

82,"Hi All. I'm having a first world problem dilemma... and would love some advice from people who have been in a similar situation.

I am currently very privileged to be living the ""data science dream"". I work as a product data scientist for a big tech company in Silicon Valley, my work is appreciated by my stakeholders and peers, I am well paid (TC = $160k for 3yoe + stock), and I feel like I am constantly learning new things at work.

I am not originally from the US, I relocated from France where I am from, and would like to move back at some point, to reconnect with family and friends. My original plan was to stay 3 more years from today, and continue saving as much as possible to move back with some savings, with the prospect of retiring early.

However I am realizing that not only salaries will be significantly lower in France (we're talking 3x lower), but the prospects do not look so exciting from a DS perspective (e.g. archaic corporations who look for data analysts, or startups who use words like ""neural networks"" in every sentence).

Anyone has been in a similar situation and would be able to provide some guidance?",1

84,"So you want a coveted internship? This answer is mainly geared towards software, but can be applicable to any industry.

I have some tips that helped me get my first software engineering internship in Silicon Valley, right out of my coding bootcamp. I break down some of the best ways to get an internship as quickly as possible, as easily as possible.

Whether you studied computer science in college, went to a coding bootcamp, or are self-taught, these tips will help you through.

If you prefer video format, here’s a video I made covering these topics:

[https://youtu.be/eyzKYYwB0ng](https://youtu.be/eyzKYYwB0ng)

The first main tip is to start as early as possible. Bigger companies who have the most internships available start early in August, September, an October with posting their internships. The earlier you start, the higher chance you have at beating the competition.

The second tip, and probably the most crucial one is to use your network. Using the back door to get your foot in is much easier than using the door that thousands of people are using (the automated online job portal). You can use LinkedIn, Facebook, and word of mouth to find people who worked at specific companies. On LinkedIn, you can use search queries like \[Insert college here\], and then use people filters such as 1st /2nd-degree connection, location, and company. This helps hyper-target your audience.

The best people in your network to reach out to are:

\- College / coding bootcamp alumni who work at the company you want to work at

\- Friends / classmates who interned at that company

\- Professors / mentors who might have connections with that company

\- Friends of friends who work there (use Facebook to search this - “friends of friends who worked at \[X company\]

The next tip (this is crucial, and will save you a ton of time). Don’t send your resume off into a black hole (such as Indeed, Glassdoor, etc) and do nothing else. My rule is for every job app you send into an online portal, you need to connect with one real person as well. There are a handful of ways to connect with a real person at this company - use a Gmail plugin like Clearbit Connect, or Hunter io to find peoples’ work emails by company search (give them a quick Google - you’ll see what I mean). These are extremely powerful tools. Then, send them a quick note:

\~\~\~

Hi \[person’s name\]!

My name is \[your name\], and I’m an \[type of engineer\] in \[location\].

I’m reaching out because I applied to \[company\] regarding your \[position\].

I have experience with \[this technology, skill, etc\]

Following up, I've provided my resume and cover attached letter below.

Would someone on your team be open to chatting more about this role by \[insert date to add time pressure\]?

Thanks so much!

\[Your name\]

\[Phone number\]

\~\~\~

Following up after they’ve responded:

Would you be willing to connect me to the hiring manager for this position per chance? I'd greatly appreciate it!

Thanks so much!

\[Your name\]

\~\~\~

The most important thing is to not be annoying. If they don’t respond after following up once or twice, try another person at the company.

If you’ve used the last 2 tips (network, reaching out) and have finally connected with a real person, you can ask them “How can I stand out in the intern application process for \[X\] company?”, or even better, ask to buy them a coffee and pick their brain about their experience working at the company, the company culture, and to see if you’d be a good fit.

Another way to stand out is to have an amazing portfolio. This isn’t absolutely necessary (at least for Software Engineers), but will help you stand out above the crowd. My tips here:

\- Host your projects on Github (clean up code, add ReadMe, etc)

\- Add your projects, with screenshots and descriptions, to your LinkedIn experience/projects section

\- Create a video outlining your design decisions, tech choices, etc (I did this when applying, and it definitely helped)

\- Deploy your projects to the web, and have a landing page which can direct people towards them

The next tip is to prepare for the technical interview. If you’ve gotten this far but fail the technical portion, chances are you won’t make it further. They can give you any question, but your goal is to be familiar enough with basic concepts, so you can adapt on the spot. Using sites like LeetCode can help improve your technical ability. It also helps if you’ve seen similar questions to the interview ones - LeetCode will help you with this. Sites like Pramp help you practice interview skills live, which is another surefire way to get feedback and improve your chances at doing well. Take a few deep breaths before you walk into the interview, and you’re ready to go because you know you prepared!

The final tip I have (and one that sped up my job search tenfold) is to track EVERYTHING. There’s a Gmail plugin called streak that allows you to track your job search in a funnel. Streak also allows to send template snippet emails, and you can see if someone has viewed your email. So handy!

I customized the funnel by tracking:

1. Company Name
2. Position Name
3. Contact Name
4. Contact Email
5. Contact LinkedIn
6. Date of Last Contact
7. Job Source
8. Job Posting URL

If you’re not a fan of Gmail plugins, you can also use a spreadsheet like Excel, Google Sheets, and my favorite (spreadsheet/database mix) Airtable! Airtable is a solid option, because it allows you to link different tables, attach documents, and organize things with ease. An Airtable tutorial would take a whole other post, but I encourage you to check it out!

The job search is ultimately a game of failure, persistence, and triumph. You ultimately need to create your own luck, and this happens by widening your pool. Start applying to as many places as possible! These tips I shared above allowed me to apply to 150 jobs in 3 days! Most of the time I ignored the cover letter (do they really matter, anyway?) and focused completely on connecting with a real person. That’s what will ultimately start you on your journey.",1

**Boring explanation for people who've never watched**

For the Non-US among us, March Madness is an annual basketball tournament similar to the knockout stages of football (single-elimination) that is used to determine the best college basketball team in the country  (think of it like UEFA Champions league but much more compressed in terms of timeframe). Since college basketball teams play in separate conferences (think domestic leagues), there is no way to claim bragging rights of the best team in the country. It's referred to as madness because the tournament takes place over 2 weeks and anything can happen (like giant-slayers in the FA cup if you're a Brit).

93,"Hey guys.

I want to discuss about something that is itching me right now.

I recently posted in the weekly Entering thread. I am a student in mathematics and computer science who is studying to become a data scientist. I am currently learning C++ by myself and was told to transition to Python ASAP. I was reading a Data Structures and Algorithms book (in C++) during that time (and still am, spoiler!)

So I did my DD and told myself why not learn that subject in Python to learn the language at the same time? There's where it became more problematic. I understand fully that for someone who wants to become a data scientist, Python is mandatory since it has these beautiful libraries for machine learning &amp; co. But the problem I faced is that when I wanted to implement my own data structures in Python, I realized that so much is done under the hood that it's pretty much impossible to get an in-depth understanding on what is happening, and to optimize stuff on ""my way"".

So my question goes as follow : Since optimizing is a huge part in a data scientist job, and playing with data structures/optimizing algorithms is also so important, why is it not pushed more to get a core undestanding of it? I understand you can use stuff that you don't understand completely, but for someone who's JOB is to use it, shouldn't he understand at least the fundamentals?

I want to hear your opinions!

PS: Just to be sure, I am not ranting on Python, I am saying it's hader to get a grasp on the core because it's all done out of sight. I am not saying C++ is better either, I am asking why people do not recommend to learn a lower level language (any!) before learning Python.

Thank you guys.

95,"(Sorry for such a long post; main question is at very end.)

I have finally received an acceptance letter for a Statistics grad program (yay!), and plan on leaving my company in late summer to go back to school full time.  I currently work as a data analyst for an automotive supplier, and my boss is aware that I will be leaving the company, and he will be working with HR soon to start the process of finding (and potentially using me in part to train) a replacement.  Thankfully, everyone is very supportive.

I was the first person in the company, so far as I am aware of, who does ""data analysis"" and has a statistical background, novice as I am on paper in that matter.  I am not very happy with the way my job is currently structured and would have planned on leaving anyway if I had not gotten an acceptance.  My work is not very well defined; there are data management issues (like storage, access, standardization across sites) which slow work; and I do not have anyone in my company who is able to double check my work from a statistical POV—or even more preferably, elevate it to (and appreciate) a higher sophistication.  While officially on a team, I am not on a team of people who do what I do, and am very independent anyway.

I have been asked to help craft a job description for my replacement.  However, while I can easily regurgitate my current responsibilities onto paper and list what skills I have found useful for executing them, I would like to expand this task to communicate back to my employer how best to structure such a job, from hierarchy of needs they should be considering in order to streamline the data analysis process (instead of merely filling roles I have been haphazardly shoehorned into, and ignoring needs which subsume them), to better establishing specific duties to achieve those ends (instead of giving the next person as much autonomy as I have).

I would like to do this, and have come to this community for feedback on how to do so, for two main reasons: (1) I myself need to grow and manage my expectations for what a better data analysis or data science job looks like, and (2) I would like my successor(s) to experience that better if I have some latitude to reform it.

To give a rough outline for what I would like to learn and communicate back to my company, posed as questions:

- **What are the standard vertical and horizontal structures surrounding a technical job like an analyst?**  Right now, I receive work not only directly from my boss, but also often directly from different people in the company (some high up) who are aware of me and the statistical skills I provide.  Sometimes these projects do not have established timelines or well-defined metrics or goals, and this creates disorganization and workload/expectation problems.  After working like this for some time, it seems to me that a wiser system would be for projects to be administered through management, and interactions between groups (such as, a chemical test lab group and my group (myself)) to ultimately start and end from above.  Is this misguided?  How do project management and team interactions work in well-functioning systems?

- With deference to some of the prior considerations, **what sort of environment (have you found) works best for a data analyst to thrive in?**  For instance, I feel that I would have liked to have another person on my team who does what I do so I could bounce ideas off them and assert my own expectations better.  I also feel that the rest of the company isn't very good at managing their own expectations for what a single data analyst can do, and my position as an almost independent service provider within the company speaks to that.  How are data analysis teams organized and how do they manage the request-result cycle?

- **What functions often go underserved in a company starting to sophisticate its data analysis process, and what skills should it seek out to fill those?**  As I mentioned above, there are non-homogeneities in how data is collected and stored and made accessible between different manufacturing or test sites that we have, and some projects that they would want to work on in the foreseeable future will involve more sharing of this data between sites.  Data is often dumped into a ""vault"" specific to each site (with very limited read access), and can be made available in a hodge-podge way on a network we have.  It doesn't seem conducive to accessibility.  I am also woefully underinformed on the full extent of data management at our company, so the problem may just be my level of knowledge; but the prescription nonetheless may be bringing in someone with the skills required to interact with the data we have, even if vaulting and networks are enough.  Who works behind the scenes that a data analyst depends on?  What skills should that person have?

- Finally, **How can I combine the above into job description(s), for employer and prospective employee alike?**  How many people make a good team?  What should they each bring to the table?

These are the things about which I will likely ask more follow up questions.  That may come when I have done some more thorough investigation into what expectations and gaps people in my company find for data analysis.  I also may not be asking the right questions, and I may have different ones depending on the feedback I get here.

Right now though, I think this is my question for this post:

How would you characterize a ""good"" and functional data analyst role and what does their team look like?",1

97,"I released a new version of my Debian packaging for JupyterHub (https://github.com/1and1/debianized-jupyterhub#jupyterhub-debian-packaging). It makes the installation of a fully working hub on a Debian or Ubuntu server easy, with everything already installed and compiled (no build tools needed).

The package comes with a fully equipped Python3 kernel – the scientific Python stack and common visualization frameworks are built in. All additional packages beyond the JupyterHub core are organized into setuptools ‘extras‘. You can select them for inclusion (many are added by default), or remove unneeded ones to reduce the package size, by changing the “debian/rules” file.

On an Ubuntu / Debian workstation, using this package you get readily available notebooks for personal use, without the need to start a notebook server on the command line every time you want to edit a notebook.

Technically, this is a self-contained Python3 venv wrapped into a Debian package (an ""omnibus"" package, all passengers on board). You can build the package in a Docker container, so that you don't need to worry about installing build dependencies – the Dockerfile does that for you, without affecting your workstation or build host.

For more details, check out the GitHub README (see link above).


Changes since 0.9.4-3:

  * Extras: Added 'docker', 'nlp', 'ml', 'utils', and 'vizjs' (included by default)
  * Extras: Added 'arrow', 'nltk', and 'parquet' (optional)
  * notebook: update to 5.7.6 (CVE-2019–9644); also updated other explicit requirements
  * Tornado: kept at 5.x because of compatibility problems

101,"I was offered a data scientist job at a unicorn fintech firm with an established data sciences team. It was my first interview for a data scientist role and I had to interview with over a dozen people including multiple leaders within the company. Even before I was invited for a face to face interview, I underwent a coding assessment (timed). I usually do not do well in timed challenges as they make me nervous and I can get flustered easily. They rejected me after the assignment (I received the news while I was waiting in the lounge of another company getting ready for my final interviews with the second firm for a Developer role). 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

But after the rejection, I decided that it wasn't the best assessment of my performance and I took all the feedback the team had for me and re-did the challenge over the course of next week. I reached out to the company again with my results and asked them to reconsider my work (with little expectation). I think the company liked my initiative and they invited me for onsite interviews. I said yes to this since I had another offer for a different role from a startup. My onsite interviews were average at best and shitty at worst. I felt I did not do well and went to bed at 5 in the evening. I could not answer questions from past since most of these questions were from five years ago. During the technical interview, the interviewers were looking for a very specific answer, but I had zero clue on what exactly they were looking for. I felt comfortable defending my work, but that's about it.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

By next noon, I got the dreaded call from the recruiter and she tells me that they really liked me (very puzzling). They wanted me to do a few more interviews with the team since the team wanted to be sure that I knew my shit. Now, to give you a quick idea about my background, I don't have much data science experience outside of some projects I did while on my free time and my startup which focuses on visual data. So I was pleasantly surprised that the company gave me an offer in like two hours after I finished my final interviews.

105,"I'm currently a senior data scientist in a small startup in Boston. I'm looking to change companies in the next year and want to begin getting experience leading a team. My current startup is very small and flat organizationally. I basically own the production machine learning pipeline and don't work closely with other team members on it, so no opportunities to manage juniors, etc.

My goal is to eventually be in a VP/Director of Data Science position and recognize I need experience leading a team. Our engineering group uses Agile (loosely) and believe this is common for many companies.

Given that I am looking to make a job change in the next year, should I pay out of pocket to get the Certified ScrumMaster designation ($1K USD and two days of classes)? Would this be a differentiator when interviewing? I'm thinking it may provide signal that I'm committed to developing as a project manager/leader, and also be valuable in its own right. 

And before this gets raised, yes, I understand that my chief value will be based on my core technical skills as a data scientist. I am already heavily invested there. FWIW, my background is PhD in engineering from a great school, 4 years experience in risk consulting for nuclear/defense industries, 4 years data science/machine learning experience.

I'm not sure if this is the exact right sub for this question--I posted it over in r/jobs as well but I was hoping to get some feedback from people in my field if possible.

I was wondering how much flexibility telecommuting employees have as far as where they work from. For some context, I currently live in New York (In Data Science / Analytics) but my SO may be doing a degree program in England. I don't want to fully give up my NY residence if I don't have to, so I'm looking for remote opportunities which would allow me to work from either the US or the UK. My ideal situation is one where I could spend 2 or 3 months at a time in either country, while working remotely full time. Is this possible? Most Remote Data Science opportunities I've seen say something like ""Work from anywhere in the US"" but I'm not sure if this means you can't work outside the country, or just that you need to be based in the US (citizenship, resident, paying taxes etc). I'm born and raised in the US so that wouldn't be an issue.

&amp;#x200B;

So for anybody here with experience in a remote analytics role, were you free to work from wherever you wanted, provided you had a good internet connection and made yourself available during business hours?

112,"Incompetent interviewers are so frustrating. Companies really need to do a better job of screening the people they allow to conduct interviews. 

So the situation was that I was in an interview process with big company that has a big AI group. I finished my second phone screen two days ago. The first one went really well. I really liked the person. I answered all of their technical questions and I received an email that they wanted to move forward.

The second guy was pretty weird. He didn't introduce himself, and I had to stop him to ask his name. He then proceeds to ask me about the one non machine learning project on my resume. I start to tell him about it, and he asks 

""Well do you have any ML experience? Because we do a lot of that here.""

Well then maybe you should ask me about the three other ML projects on my resume which you clearly didn't read until you asked me that question. I then started to tell him about one of the ML projects on my resume. He asks a few questions in that annoying way, where interviewers try to poke holes in your work to try to through you off balance. I'm thinking ""Dude I worked on this for a year. I know what I'm talking about."" I answer his questions and he seems satisfied.

He then asks me a few basic ML questions (e.g. explain linear regression and SVMs). I easily answer those. He asks me a coding question, which I also easily answer. Throughout this whole time he's challenging me by asking questions on things that he clearly doesn't understand that well. He tried poking holes in my solutions, usually by saying things that we're just wrong, which led me having correct his understanding of basic things (e.g. What is a random variable). I try my best to do it politely as possible.

He then says that he doesn't have anymore questions and if there's anything I want to ask him. I ask a few basic questions about the company, and we call it a day.

I get feedback today that they're not moving forward because of my lack of knowledge of NLP. Dude didn't even ask me about NLP. If he did he would know I'm pretty freaking knowledgable about it. We ended the interview 15 minutes early, which I don't maybe he could have used to ask me about NLP if it's so important. 

What's really frustrating to me about this is the AI group there is really large and the fact that I had a problem with this interviewer doesn't mean I wouldn't fit. In other situations I would just say ""Well at least I don't have to work with him."" But from talking to the other guy, I think I would have actually fit in really well there, and I just had bad luck by getting this one guy as an interviewer.

113,"This is kind of a rant, but I see so many people who parrot the sentiment that ""data science"" degrees are a joke, or that it's ""just applied statistics"" and that there's a stigma.

I come from a pure math background and I've seen mathematicians say very similar things about statistics or physics or CS: ""oh that's really just applied math"" or ""they are not really rigorous like math"". And I found that incredibly annoying and I guess the reason why I get annoyed by this sub's hate for data science too.

I see people coming from data science or business analytics degrees from schools like MIT, NYU, Carnegie Mellon that do just fine. Obviously these are good programs and there are countless other shitty data science programs not worth their salt. But it's the same thing with degrees in statistics or CS, innit? Yes, the popularity of statistics and CS means these master's programs have been sprouting like rabbits too. It's not just data science.

Over the years I have obsessed about how to make it easy for every one to build their resume. Using some AI magic, I ended up creating a site (a side project) that allows you to create a resume for free. Here’s the link: [https://thisresumedoesnotexist.com/](https://thisresumedoesnotexist.com/)

I've used [https://github.com/minimaxir/textgenrnn/tree/master/textgenrnn](https://github.com/minimaxir/textgenrnn/tree/master/textgenrnn) to generate the text by feeding it data scraped from various resources. My script runs in a ""while true"" loop and generates a new resume every 3-4 seconds. Resume is then saved to S3 and the same resume is loaded via CloudFront for all users.

I plan to make it more and more awesome, like you add your name and designation and it fills up your resume. But, I thought it would be nice to get a feedback from you folks and see if I can add the to my to-do for the side project.

I’d the following thoughts on why I started working on it:

\- I knew a guy who got a job at Google, who previously couldn’t get a job at an IT agency just cause his resume wasn’t good enough

\- Not all of us have the skills required to write creatively and organize it. That doesn’t mean you don’t qualify for a job

Things like these are weirdly still a hurdle for many (it is going to be 2020 next year!). I want them not to be a hurdle anymore :slightly\_smiling\_face:

(I’m also interested in how this might relate to Bain’s [Macro Trends](https://www.bain.com/insights/topics/macro-trends/) practice.)

&gt;At a time when private equity firms face soaring asset prices and heavy competition for deals, advanced analytics can help them derive the kinds of proprietary insights that give them an essential edge against rivals. These emerging technologies can offer fund managers rapid access to deep information about a target company and its competitive position, significantly improving the firm’s ability to assess opportunities and threats. That improves the firm’s confidence in bidding aggressively for companies it believes in—or walking away from a target with underlying issues.

**Questions:** Does anyone here use their data science skills for private equity research or economics for a consulting firm like Bain? What is that work like? What tools do you use, and how would you recommend someone interested in making a switch to that field? Any recommended resources to learn more about that career path?

**Background:** I currently work as a marketing strategist, I’m starting a dual-degree MBA/MS in Business Analytics in the fall with elementary programming and math experience (though I do have an MA in humanities).

in our company, my Data Science team is currently struggling with the 'last mile', i.e. have our insights and predictions bring about actual change.

We have sufficiently mastered the technical aspects, with APIs and platform at our disposal and available to others. Also, we've established trust with senior management executives.

What remains is to convince coworkers from other departments, e.g. sales, to work with us. Many hesitate to cooperate or to make use of our results and our work, and I feel like this boils down to a couple of human reasons:

* The generally resist change, especially when initiated by others
* Their division manager might have a long-standing rivalry with our division manager
* They see us and our suggestions/results as 'invading their territory'
* They view us as young and snobbish know-it-alls

How would you approach this problem? 

As a last measure, we could make our case with the executive level and have them pressure their guys to cooperate. However, we'd really like to solve this problem 'bottom-up' instead of 'top-down'.

128,"[**Knitty**](https://github.com/kiwi0fruit/knitty) is a Pandoc filter and [Atom/Hydrogen](https://atom.io/packages/hydrogen)-friendly reproducible report generation tool via Jupyter, Pandoc and Markdown (fork of the [Stitch](https://github.com/kiwi0fruit/knitty/blob/master/docs/stitch.md) that is a [Knitr](http://yihui.name/knitr/)-[RMarkdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com)-like library in Python). Insert python code (or other Jupyter kernel code) *to the Markdown document* **or write in plain Python/Julia/R with block-commented Markdown** and have code's results in the Pandoc output document.

Knitty is an important part of the [Best Python/Jupyter/PyCharm experience + report generation with Pandoc filters](https://github.com/kiwi0fruit/pandoctools/blob/master/docs/best_python_jupyter_pycharm_experience.md) (see there why writing in plain Python/Julia/R is great) but actually

Knitty is language agnostic and can be used with any Jupyter kernel. Can be used independently of Pandoctools and with any IDE of choise. So I guess it deserves a separate post. By the way: Atom/Hydrogen is also language agnostic. You can also try **VS Code** interface to Jupyter from [**vscode-python**](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-python) instead of Atom/Hydrogen. I highly recommend to try to think about ipynb as merely an output format like pdf instead of main format or intermediate format (albeit ipynb is great for presenting narrative interactively and it can even [be much more](https://github.com/kiwi0fruit/misc/blob/master/src/pdf_and_word_killer.md)).

Our team recently prototyped building reports using Tableau and management absolutely loved it. However, our concern is the amount of business partners that might come to us going forward to help build dashboards for them, which would be overwhelming.

Few Questions:

1. What do you think works better? A centralized or decentralized model? 
2. As a business unit, we are by no way ""IT"" and would want not want to maintain every single dashboard we build going forward.
3. Do you guys have a Tableau ""center of excellence"" to train other users in the organization on Tableau?

132,"So I have a question regarding deep learning and more ""traditional"" machine learning usages in industry. My understanding is that deep learning is ""less transparent,"" in how it works, whereas ""traditional machine learning,"" is more transparent. This leads me to believe that for business use cases, such as for marketing, would prefer ""traditional machine learning,"" because the models can easily explain how they derived their results, whereas for a ""deep learning model,"" is less helpful if we're trying to explain why a prediction is off.

137,"Hi, i am what in the industry is called a data scientist. I have a master's degree in statistics and for the past 3 years i worked with 2 companies, doing modelling, data cleaning, feature engineering, reporting, presentations... A bit of everything, really.

It seems impossible to me to get employed. I pass the first interview, they give me a take-home test and then I can't seem to pass to the following stages. The tests are always a variation of:

* Work that the company tries to outsource to the people applying, so they can reuse the code for themselves.

* Kaggle-like ""competitions"", where you have been given some data to clean and model... Without a clear purpose.

* Live questions on things i have studied 3 or more years ago (like what is the domain of tanh)

* Software engineer work

138,"I recently got my first job as a data scientist and wanted to share some thoughts about the job hunt process and tips I found helpful for landing a first gig in the field.

&amp;#x200B;

Some background (without giving away too much PI): I had a varied education and career path to this point. Both my BSc, MSc, and PhD were in STEM fields. I decided to make the switch to data science after seeing some friends have success in the area.

&amp;#x200B;

I had no formal experience in data science/AI, although I had much coding experience (mainly python and matlab) from my degrees. So I decided to self teach data science and then apply for jobs. There were many ups and downs in the process as a whole, and a lot of lessons I learned as I went along in the job hunt.

&amp;#x200B;

To form a solid understanding of the machine learning field, I started by going through a machine learning primer on [pythonprogramming.net](https://pythonprogramming.net). I found a nice mix of math theory (low level) and code. The course covered all of the main algorithms used in machine learning by first explaining the behind the scenes idea and then coding a algorithm from scratch and then (in some cases) using it on a dataset. Towardsdatascience also is great (for the right author) for getting a quick easy overview of something.

&amp;#x200B;

After this I applied to my first round of jobs, and found that this is probly not enough to get in the field. I got a few interviews, but response rate was about 7% of my applications (applied for about 50 jobs). I applied for all jobs online, via indeed, glassdoor, etc. While applying I started an excel file listing all applications and dates applied. This gave me a way to measure response rates and see what helped increase this.

&amp;#x200B;

So, after realizing I needed something more, I took on a new undertaking. I reworked through in depth math of the popular algorithms using Elements of Statistical Learning (textbook freely available online). Then, I found some data sets online (either off kaggle or the UCI repository) and went through an entire in depth project on these sets. Data cleaning, exploratory analysis, predictive. I mean really clean out the problem, I read publications about the dataset, established baselines, interpreted results, etc. I then made a github account and made a data science portfolio and posted a couple of projects on there. Then I reopened the application process and applied to about 50 more jobs. IF YOU TAKE AWAY ANY ADVICE TAKE THIS: make a porfolio and post a project. Choose a project that is socially relevant and any layman could see why its interesting (ie healthcare, not Gaussian data distributions). This astronomically increased my responses. I would estimate that, per 20 applications, I got interviews for 5-6 jobs. After much interviewing I finally got a good offer which I accepted.

&amp;#x200B;

Interviews follow the same basic structure everywhere, and here's what I learned going through them:

1. The HR screen. After bungling a couple of these I finally figured them out; after an HR screen now I would say I have a near 100% conversion rate to a second round interview. They don't know technical stuff, they want to get an idea of who you are and make sure you aren't a weirdo and can articulate yourself. So here's how to ace them: find a project you worked on and explain the technical concepts to them in VERY easy to understand ways. I found explaining algorithms using sports analogies very effective. Relate the project to someone who doesn't care about data science; why is the problem interesting, what are implications of your results. Besides that be prepared to answer the basics like ""why are you interested in this company"", ""how do you face challenges"", etc.
2. 2) the technical interview. The contents of this stage really varies. Most times, I would be asked to explain technical aspects of my DS projects. They would start off with ""explain a project youve worked on and how you solved it"". Why did I use this algorithm and not another, why did I do a dimensional reduction, how did I clean the data, etc. Then, I would get asked to explain the workings of a particular algo I had used. Some would ask that I explain it to someone who didn't know about computers, and some would ask I explain the math and algorithm structure. If you paid attention to my first point you'll be ready for the layman explanation. So be prepared for both. I would really prepare a nice ""lecture"" about an algo, because some would just say ""explain your favorite algorithm"".  Some will go through your resume and ask you to explain buzzwords, so be prepared for that.
3. 3) the coding challenge. These are annoying. They are generally easy, most I got were binary classification problems. A couple I got were just data sets and they said ""do something interesting"". If you've done a DS project it shouldn't be hard. The annoying part is that most would say ""this should take about 4 hours, heres 5 days to turn it in"". So what I imagine happens, is some candidates spend 4 hours and get some interesting insights and send it off, and others spend 5 days straight doing a crazy analysis of it. One company arranged a time I would like the challenge to be sent to me, and I had to submit results within 4 hours. I think this is the best format, as it really puts everyone on the same playing field. I would suggest doing a very simple practice classification problem from a common dataset (the UCI wine thing for example) and just get a ""template"" ready that isn't too difficult to change between basic datasets. Also, some jobs that blasted me a dataset without a phone call or email first I found quite rude and didn't pursue.

&amp;#x200B;

Final tips: I know many people on this sub complain about buzzword resumes; but Ill offer a different take. The people who get a giant pile of resumes to sort through are the HR people; I had a friend who is an HR rep for a DS company look over my resume. These HR people don't know DS; they have a job description for a role that has buzzwords in it (candidate should know regression, tensorflow, blah blah) and they match your resume to that. So I found that by including buzzwords  (listed algorithms I knew, math I knew)  I increased my response rate.

&amp;#x200B;

Also I added a section in my resume explaining the DS projects I had done and tools I used to do them (bold font the tools for fast reading), this also increases response rate (link to your github portfolio too). All in all, the job hunt process is a meat grinder and sucks. I sent out a total of about 100 job applications, got a couple cheapo offers that I declined, and accepted a solid one. I completed about 30 interviews. The whole process took about 3 months. The jobs I didn't get interviews for I think is because I didn't match the description exactly or didn't match the experience requirement, lots of them want big data framework experience which I didn't have (hadoop, apache etc). This would be easy to learn, but the screeners don't know this really so probly tossed my resume. I would've learned it myself but getting 4 coding challenges a week bogs you down a bit :P.

&amp;#x200B;

Remember, the increase in interview requests and inceased knowledge is not just a correlation, it's a causation. As you're applying, learn something new everyday.",1

140,"My company currently has a bunch of disparate marketing data sources coming from places like google AdWords, Facebook ads, Bing ads, commission junction, and many others.

We're two friend who met in college and learned Python together, we co-created a package which can provide an estimate for the training time of scikit-learn algorithms.

Here is our idea of the use case for this tool:When you are in the process of building a machine learning model or deploying your code to production, knowledge of how long your algorithm can help you validate and test that there are no errors in your code without wasting precious time.

As far as we know there was no practical automated way of evaluating the runtime of an algo before running it. This tries to solve this problem. It especially helps in the case of heavy models when you want to keep your sklearn.fit under control.

Let’s say you wanted to train a kmeans clustering for example, given an input matrix X. Here’s how you would compute the runtime estimate:

    From sklearn.clusters import KMeans
    from scitime import Estimator 
    kmeans = KMeans() 
    estimator = Estimator(verbose=3) 
    #Run the estimation 
    estimation, lower_bound, upper_bound = estimator.time(kmeans, X)

### Why build ""a minimalist scheduler""?

A few months ago [I asked what the sub thought about current data pipeline technologies](https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/9uz05o/whats_your_opinion_on_current_data_pipeline/). The consensus was that Airflow was the best option, but every popular option requires significant resources to learn and implement.

I'm a data scientist working on a young product. I made that post at a time when we were unsure how to automate our data pipeline. Airflow is free, sure, but things weren't breaking yet and the time investment made Airflow an expensive option for us. We decided to point CRON jobs to shell scripts instead. It was fast, cheap, and easy to debug in the rare event of failure. It wasn't a permanent solution; it was a good-enough-for-now solution.

I revisited the problem a couple months later, and I realized there must be hundreds of teams like mine in this limbo: still unable to justify the cost of Airflow and growing too fast to rely on CRON and shell scripts. Clearly there's a need, yet there was no such scheduler that I could find. 

I started engineering my own solution. I didn't need all of Airflow's features. I thought, ""What can I take away from Airflow to make scheduling more accessible?"" I took away the UI. I took away the sqlite database. I took away asynchronous scheduling, bash operator, and triggers. I kept the scheduling, dynamic configuration, python operators. I even added some functionality to support virtualenv, pipenv, and conda environments. 

What remained was Dequindre: a minimalist scheduler I could setup in minutes. It's production-capable too. We're migrating to use Dequindre on my team at work. 

### What's Next?  

Dequindre v0.10 marks the start of ""public beta testing,"" which means I'll be answering public bugs, questions, and feature requests. I'll release Dequindre v1.0 when I'm confident the core functionality is tight. Right now I guess that might be April or June. There might be a v2.0 and beyond, but Dequindre is minimalist by design; there's only so many features I'll consider adding before recommending something more full-featured like Airflow. ",1

I work as a lead project manager for a very large company. I am good at my job (or at least my yearly performance reviews say that) but I honestly don't like my job. I am regularly given failing projects and tasked with replanning the project. The stress is wearing me out. I want to work in data science - I'll have my MSc in data analytics within the year and I'm working on creating a portfolio and getting my first data science job. I incorporate data science techniques into what I do and I credit that with what makes me successful.


Situation: 
My company is very antiquated and slow to adopt new technologies. At the end of last year they announced they were going to start embedding data analysts within teams and hire some data scientists. I thought great, here's my chance to get into the field. 


I cannot get an interview to be a data analyst because, according to the hiring manager, I don't have experience. It's frustrating because I regularly demonstrate the application of the needed skills and knowledge, but okay fine.


Fast forward a few weeks a newly hired data analyst is imbeded with my team. I try to make the best of it and think, hey, I can talk data science with this guy.


The person hired doesn't have a background in data science. He doesn't know statistics or any programming languages. He had to ask me for help writing a simple SQL query so he could put the data into Excel and make a pivot chart. The hiring managers are business people who don't know anything about data science. The data analysts are being used as Excel jockies.


I don't fault the people hired as data analysts but it frustrates me that the managers have no idea what they are doing in regards to hiring and utilizing data analysts. I feel like within my company they are devaluing data science by having people not in the field doing the hiring and management of the analysts. It's looking more and more like I'll have to leave the company to work in my desired field. That will be difficult because I'll likely have to take a pay cut to get a job elsewhere.

151,"To be more specific, I am talking about the situation where you have deployed a binary classifier (could be multiclass) into production where you are taking actions on people based on the predicted outcome score from the classifier. One thing I have been thinking about is what kind of metrics to use to validate the confidence of the actual score outputted by the model. e.g. If a model outputs a score ('probability') of 0.74, what is the expected chance that the predicted event will actually occur?

&amp;#x200B;

The initial assumption might be that there is a 74% chance but that seems to be confusing the model's score with a confident probability which doesn't seem right. I've also looked into MC DropOut as a method of estimating confidence, but I'm curious about situations where Neural Networks aren't in play. My initial guess on how to approach this would be to deploy the classifier for a while and collect data on it's predictions and the actual future outcomes. Then, taking all of the predicted scores (that we take no action on), I would bin them up so that there's a bin for all the predicted scores in \[0.7, 0.75\] and a bin for predicted scores of \[.85, .9\], and so on. Then, I would calculate the average proportion of people that had the event occur, and would expect roughly 72.5% of the people to have the event occur in the first bin, etc.

&amp;#x200B;

But, I'm wondering if there is any way to quantify this better? I'm guessing research has probably been done on this and I just haven't come across it. Any ideas on good lines of research to look into, or maybe examples where this is already being done?

&amp;#x200B;

161,"I recently had an interview for an entry level data scientist position. At one point the interviewer scoffed at using sklearn or other similar packages because: 1. he didn't ""trust it"" and 2. his data ""wasn't the kind you could just plug into a [model.fit](https://model.fit)()"" but was more ""nuanced and complex"".  For those reasons he instead builds all of his machine learning models from scratch. In my opinion it stuck me as a bit arrogant to think that an open source software is to be trusted less than something one or two people have fully reviewed.  But I'm also not sure of how many situations there are in which there is no available library or prepackaged model, or it is more advantageous to DIY.

Few questions here:

1. Does anyone else here find standard machine learning libraries such as sklearn untrustable? If so why? Are these models not to be used in production for some reason I'm not aware of?
2. How often does a data scientist really need to build these models themselves? Or put another way how big a project does it need to be before meriting a self-built approach? e.g. I can imagine prebuilt models being the go to for quick analyses but when company's core product is centered around a machine learning algorithm it may make sense to build it from scratch. I'm wondering what it looks like between those two extremes.
3. In what scenarios is it preferred to build a model from scratch? I can understand the situation where a library or language isn't available in a production environment, or the model needs to be written in a different programming language. I'm more interested in cases where this is a decision from the model builder and not imposed by infrastructure requirements.

After being in industry for a while I've observed there tends to be about 4 main different flavours of 'data scientist':

**Data Analyst**

5 or 10 years ago, these people would've just been called BI analysts or data analysts- just doing basic data viz, reporting, dashboards and SQL querying. Then companies started to try and sex up these positions by giving them a new buzzword title 'data scientist'. There may be a few of these people who do some basic ML and stats but in my experience this is uncommon. Usually good with tools like Tableau etc

**Statistician**

Again, 5 or 10 years ago, these people would've just been called statisticians or mathematicians. They focus mainly on inferential modelling or if they do predictive it's using traditional statistical techniques like linear regression. These guys are highly skilled in stats theory and some in ML as well, but they tend not to have great CS/software engineering skills, and usually their work consists of ad hoc analyses that they aren't responsible for delivering to production. Typically program in R, or in more old school organizations maybe something like SPSS.

**Machine Learning Engineer**

This is where the major growth area in 'data science' has been in the past 5-10 years IMO. These people typically have good CS/Software Engineering skills and are involved in deploying models to production. They tend to focus mainly on predictive models and most will be in strong in more 'modern' ML techniques, but some (not all) may be weaker in 'traditional stats' models. Work mainly in Python but may drop down to lower level languages when required.

**Data Engineer**

These people range from plain old DBAs rebranded to Big Data Engineers who work with Spark/Hadoop/Cassandra etc and work in Scala or Python or maybe even Java. The Big Data Engineers might also be proficient in the ML libraries specific to their particular big data architecture.

To me, all of this begs the question, should we just ditch the terms 'data science' and 'data scientist'? In my opinion, they are vague, generic buzzwords that do nothing but confuse people. Be interested to hear other people's thoughts though.

I'm currently looking for a budding data science teammate to build out and expand on the analytics for an app I'm working on. What's a good place to look for budding data scientists looking to grow the resume/portfolio?

**Background**:

Last year, I spent several months studying data science in hopes of working in behavioral health analytics. I loved it, but grew tired of analyzing random datasets for my portfolio; I really wanted to analyze my own data, but wanted to automate the process as much as possible. I switched over to web &amp; mobile dev and began work on the app in React Native. After several months, I finally launched the app in December. I was proud of the product, but also recognize that it needs some love, especially on the analytics side. Soon after launch, I landed a mobile dev gig at a startup and haven't had time to sit down and do everything solo like I used to. It has a (very) modest user base and I want to continue development on the side. It's obviously just volunteer work - the app is currently free - but I'd be happy to chat about options if it goes somewhere!

Anyway, many thanks. If this isn't the sub to look, my apologies. If you do know where I might find interested souls, please let me know!",1

On the other hand, I am currently dealing with a project that doesn't need any predictive models, but contains lots and lots of data to be explored, analyzed, summarized, and re-organized (rich geographic datasets can be quite multidimensional and messy). As the result the project directory looks approximately like this:

Does anyone have experience dealing with such projects? Date based project/notebook naming seems quite interesting (e.g.: `2019-03-05_thing-to-analyze-1`), but I'm afraid it might make it harder to understand which stuff is old and which stuff has been recently revisited.

Unfortunately it's not that popular question. Sometimes it turns into [Cython/Numba/C/C++ battles](https://github.com/pydata/sparse/issues/126).

There is a discussion of this issue: [Why Julia? Will Python/Numba and Python/Cython lose to Julia?](https://github.com/numba/numba/issues/3814). And I cannot foresee any solution to this disarray except maybe [interop at the C level](https://numba.pydata.org/numba-doc/dev/user/cfunc.html#example). If there would be a PEP specification for such API then it would be even better. But I guess the solution to this should be as pythonic as possible (mentioned Numba tools to create C functions in a pythonic way are really good).

But I'm not sure how scalable is interop at the C level approach (it's merely my lack of knowledge). Can there be compositions of compositions?

## Python to Julia transpiler

In contrast to Python Julia language doesn't suffer from lack of unified API and it constantly enriches packages ecosystem that can be easily combined. Now it even has a stable release. This actually brings another possibility to fix the problem mentioned.

It would be nice to have Transpiler from subset of Python with special module named like ""Juthon"" to feature-complete subset of Julia (sometimes there are more than one way to do something in Julia).

And a idea looks like it should both be:

1. Standalone transpiler so that the user can write ""Juthon"" package and contribute it to the Julia ecosystem by transpiling.
2. Runtime decorator style transpiler (with interface like Numba has) that calls Julia (or compiled python library in the future) from Python. So that a small piece of code can be added right in the Python app written in Python.

I wonder if 2. possible though... If not then something like [enaml import](https://github.com/nucleic/enaml) can be tried that wraps transpiling and wrapping of Julia call. This can even be preferable approach.

A good example of a transipiler from Python is [Transcrypt](https://github.com/QQuick/Transcrypt/issues/619) that is a valid Python prior transpiling. But to achieve 1. this should be more like Julia in Python syntax than attempt to implement Python's standard library.

I guess it should be done via IDE friendly mapping and juthon module with source to source mapping for Julia autocompletion and lynting passthrough as it seems that automatic creating of typed and documented python stubs would require more work than source mapping; for example Julia to python transpiling for other modules inspection. That would mean lack of type inspection inside IDE - errors should be displayed by jit transpiler and later julia compiler.

The convenience matters a lot.

We all wear different hats, take on different roles, and no one person is assigned just one job. All of that is fine with me when it's within my realm of knowledge.

&amp;#x200B;

Lately, I've been asked to do shittier and shittier tasks. I've written so many powerpoints/slidedecks for our presentations and sales meetings that it's making me want to leave. I don't enjoy writing sales decks, I'm not good at it, and when I do them there's typically a lot of revision. The founders see this as ""professional development"" and enhancing my ""professional communication"". When I pressed them on my professional communication being lackluster they said no, that it was great for communicating with our clients and within the office. I asked them why they felt I needed further development, and their response was that I should know how to sell our product and services so that I could give presentations to clients. I told them I have no interest in learning how to be a salesman, attending sales meetings, or being involved with the sales side of the business.

  
They're still having me do these tasks because I have the greatest knowledge of what we do and the vast majority of the services/products are my work. Has anyone else been in a similar position and how did you get yourself out of it other than quitting? I'd rather not quit, I love the actual work we do, but this continued push for me to be more tied in with the front of the business is wearing me down.",1

I was actually never an intern myself in college, so I have no idea where to begin. I'm thinking a part time semester long internship may be best to begin with so I have a little time solo to work on my own job and have some time to figure out tasks to give the intern. 

If you've been a DS intern in the past, how did it go? Did you end up accepting a FT offer from the company afterward? Were you ever bored or didn't feel like you had enough to do, or did you feel overwhelmed? How were tasks delegated? I also want to include a career mentorship component, so if you had any experience with that, I'd love to hear about it.

If you've run a DS internship before, how did you balance your own work and mentoring the intern? Did you give them a single project to work on or just random tasks from other projects? Did you offer them a FT job afterwards? ",1

It's basically creating a reduced writing system and including use of symbols to write faster, and it will generally require some expertise to ""decode"". Experts in shorthand can apparently write over 200 words per minute.  
  

Naturally from here I started thinking about what the digital equivalent to shorthand would be and I've thought of some random ideas that may have a place in a similar system:  
   
  

- Text expansion, if you went crazy with this then there would likely be a huge learning curve.  
- Using a typed shorthand system like [keyscript](http://keyscript.wikifoundry-mobile.com/m/page/Alpha+Shorthand+Systems), then decode it with some ML system, although I'd imagine that this would have a lot of challenges.

205,"I'm an experienced data scientist (I actually lead a large team) and am reasonably literate about computers, though I am not a developer or IT professional. My organization is split roughly 50/50 between Python users and R users (and a few unicorns who are proficient in both). The general consensus, with which I don't disagree, is that R is generally better for data analysis/exploration/visualization because of dplyr and 
ggplot2 (tidyverse), and Python is generally better for machine learning because of sklearn, Keras, and Tensorflow. And yet, R is good enough for machine learning (mlr, caret) and Python good enough for data analysis/exploration/visualization (pandas, matplotlib) that you don't \*really\* need to learn the other unless you stumble upon some problem for which there is no library in your preferred language.

I started out using R when I got into data science because the guy who was showing me the ropes was an R guy. I was able to quickly and easily get RStudio installed on my machine, load up the packages I need, and start learning the language. R has plenty of quirks, but it has served me well over the years and I am able to do pretty much anything I need to do with it short of really complicated deep learning, which isn't really a requirement at the company I'm at anyway. For nearly all of our ML problems, some combination of linear regression, random forests, or XGBoost will get the job done. And mxnet actually works pretty well for deep learning in R.

However, I always want to expand my skillset, and I have tried several times to work in Python. The first time, a friend showed me how to set up a Jupyter Notebook and I was able to get some basic things working in that after several hours of trying to set it up. The biggest pain was realizing that I had to install Python on a path without any spaces in it and then go set my Windows path variable to get it to work. I eventually decided that R tools suited me better and went back to R. I tried again a year later when I wanted to play around with deep learning and was able to get TensorFlow working after **several** **days** of wading through their never-correct documentation, scraping message boards for help, and eventually finding a blog post that solved the rest of my problem. Then I decided that the syntax was way more complicated than it needed to be (I wasn't aware of Keras yet), and went back to using mxnet in R.

The other day, I discovered the reticulate package for R and have been trying to get it to work, with no success. I have read through all the documentation, tried using conda\_install() and use\_python() to create a virtual environment with all the libraries I need, but it is failing to find numpy. On the reticulate page, my exact situation exists as an open issue and there has been a long chain of discussion but no resolution. Several hours down the drain.

My point is, RStudio installed just fine on the first try. All the packages load and work pretty much right away. I've never had to worry about keeping several version of R on my machine or changing any environment variables. I haven't had to spend endless hours digging through message boards just to get R to *run*. I really want to learn to like Python, but it *really makes itself hard to love*. I'm too busy to spend days and days setting it up and tweaking things. Why hasn't one of the most popular programming languages in the world been able to get some *basic* things right such as, ""You can run this installer on Windows 10 and it will work out of the box""?",1

Objective: Binary classification of whether transaction is fraud (1) or non fraud (0).

After doing this, I feed only the non fraud data/target as my training data into the autoencoder using Mean Squared Error as my metric of evaluation. From my understanding, this is what will serve as the Reconstruction Error that is being used to compare the classes.

Finally, I predict using the autoencoder on the fraud class (1) data and calculate the Reconstruction Error on that data.

I am a budding data scientist working for a major municipality. In 2018 we started as a small data science team of 4, working from our laptops. Eventually, we got a linux server where we could host our work and deploy our first model on. However, this server is hosted outside of our company's architecture.

During this time, our municipality is making a hard push to become data driven, including automation of data entry, storage, and an overhaul of our IT architecture. I feel this is an excellent opportunity to take our data science team to the next level, and try to push for a small but complete architecture that can help us deploy our models internally. This would be a major help since we could directly connect to the existing databases (where now we have to use manual extracts to feed our models).

However, this is where my knowledge gets stuck. I have been reading up on things like linux, spark, docker, etc. But it's difficult for me to form a comprehensive overview of what architecture is standard for data scientists, and (maybe more important since I have to defend and push for this) why we would need this. 

For example: I try to push for docker implementation in order to shorten the gap between our new engineering team and the end product of data scientists (since the engineers want to use docker too). However, I don't know exactly why docker works so well for this and why it is better than other tools. However, I need to know this in order to defend our choices.

Any help with a comprehensive overview providing me with a structure regarding architecture and deployment would help greatly! (or anyone chiming to provide their knowledge from experience).

2. Upvote the ones you believe are important core skill sets, but DO NOT downvote any other skills if you disagree/don't know is key. If you don't agree with a skill set not being core, simply don't upvote.
3. Leave your comments as second level comments so the top comments are always relating to the skills in question.

235,"This is a little lengthy but I hope you find the story interesting and would greatly appreciate any feedback.

Some history that brought me to this point:

* Transitioned from a Software Engineer to Data Scientist role \~5 years ago, while working at a mid-sized software company in an extremely niche market in a smallish city.
* Got the opportunity to work on some run-of-the-mill problems (data analysis, classification, forecasting) and not so run-of-the-mill problems (rebate optimization for cooperative purchasing / buying groups).
* The business was interested in the results but never interested in moving our data science initiative forward as they weren't really forward thinking.
* My role slowly transitioned to managing the development and implementation of a new reporting solution using a software problem plagued with bugs, affording me less time to maintain existing models and continue to innovate; less time to practice data science.

As a result of the last event, I decided to look for another job with the constraint that I wouldn't be able to leave the city. Since there isn't a huge tech presence here, the frequency of data scientist job postings is about 0-1 times per quarter. Lucky for me, one popped up and I jumped on it, I was getting pretty miserable going back to managing a dev team at the company I'd been working for for 7 years and felt like the move was long overdue.

Not only was I desperate to get out of my current role, but the context and scope of the posting appealed to me - a data science role at a multinational company within a large (\~150 person) finance team (finance as in cost and management accounting and internal audit). Within the team I would be data scientist #1.

I haven't come across any literature on data scientists embedded within finance teams so I thought this would be a challenging albeit rewarding opportunity if I could innovate in the accounting space. The organization has a dedicated data science team focussed on innovation and run-of-the-mill user experience and revenue problems which admittedly sounded a little sexier but the team is located in another city.

My concerns:

* I accepted a slightly lower salary though it could be more if I'm awarded a discretionary bonus, based on overall company performance, and maximize my retirement savings investment matching plan.
* I have left a software company that was starting to embrace modern technologies (Azure, Docker, Angular, more reliance on web services) which would pave the way for the adoption of ML / AI in some of their products though we were probably 2-3 years away from it.
* The company I have accepted a job at seems very focussed on a small subset of problems which mostly could benefit from some data mining at best as they feel that opportunity exist but we need to discover it. For example, my first task is to complete a project that the previous person who was in my role had got to about 80% completion with. One of my short-term responsibilities is to establish KPIs, build some dashboards for users in operational and strategic roles, and help converge on a change management strategy since analytics is foreign to a lot of people at the org. Once the project is complete, they want to keep trying to extract insights for the particular problem, rather than exploring new use cases.
* I'm going to spend a tremendous amount of time trying to integrate data from a very heterogeneous set of sources from different providers (lots of time on the phone and exchanging emails), rather than have an eng team work on it.
* In line with above, I'm afraid that the organization will become obsessed with pumping out reports or that I will spend the next two years bringing them up to a basic level of analytics maturity.
* When I say ""predictive models"" they think ""financial forecasting"" rather than classification models for e.g. expense categories and feel that even financial forecasting is something ""we are a long ways away from"".
* I'm starting to fear there are limited problems in accounting on which the full breadth of data science can be brought to bear, leaving me with irrelevant experience and ""behind the times"".
* **My future job opportunities at technology companies (which is eventually where I want to end up given the scale of the problems) will be impacted since I'd be coming from a non-technology company, even though I have 9 years experience working in software.**

The good:

* Lots of opportunity to interact with stakeholders, working to understand their business problems, and developing creative data solutions to address them.
* The opportunity to present findings to senior management (CEO, CFO) of company that generates more than $1bn a year in revenue.
* A manager and executive sponsor who seem very excited to become a ""cutting edge"" finance department with respect to technology and analytics capabilities, even though they aren't aware of the all the possibilities.
* I have the opportunity gain valuable change management experience.
* I have the opportunity to work with my manager to build a team of data scientists and analysts if we get a few quick wins.

The big question that I keep asking myself is ""Should I stick this out and put my full effort and passion behind it to make the initiative a success, or am I being overly optimistic in my pursuit of bringing the full breadth of data-driven decision making to a finance department?"".",1

Details of my thoughts in the blog post, [The limits of SQL in data science, analytics, and engineering](https://towardsdatascience.com/the-limits-of-sql-in-data-science-analytics-and-engineering-4d7e48271a2f). Most controversial opinion is that I'm thinking Spark, DataFrames, and Scala could be developed and read by non-engineers to totally replace SQL.

What are your thoughts about using SQL in data science? Have you been able to use SQL for larger and more complex work? Are there notable benefits to using SQL in place of Spark Curious what other people think before I start trying to convert more people from SQL to Spark. Thanks!",1

I would like to share my personal data science project on how I analyzed my weight loss data in 2018. You can read my [writeup](https://link.medium.com/9KJRGuzsqU) on the project on Medium, and check out its Github [repo](https://github.com/dknguyengit/logweight).

The 2 main goals for the project are:

* Build a machine learning model (namely regularized logistic regression) to classify whether I would gain weight or lose weight on a given day given how many calories I eat beyond my allowed budget and my step count for that day. The parameters of the model (the regression coefficients and the decision boundary) are also used to give simple, actionable numbers that I could use for my weight loss journey.

* Build this machine learning model from scratch without using 3rd-party libraries (aside from numpy and pandas). This includes the model algorithm (batch gradient ascent), k-fold cross validation, performance metrics, ROC curve, and other related visualizations. This turned out to be not as intimidating as I'd thought. In fact, the core algorithm for batch gradient ascent can be done in 3 lines of code!

I've tried to tailor my writing to be accessible to beginners (as I'm also a relative beginner to data science). Therefore, I'd truly appreciate any input on how I can make my writing and visualizations better.

Also, I'm thinking of doing to do a 30-day challenge, during which I followed the guideline outlined in the project, and see how consistent I can lose weight doing so (perhaps via daily updates through a Twitter account). I think it might be fun to use this as a real-life test set for my model, but I'm afraid of the potential public failure 😭 If you've read my Medium post, please let me know what you think about this idea.

Please also let me know if you have any question or feedback on my project!",1

When should you do pre-processing to avoid over fitting?

Do you do it both on the training and the test set, which may give you different values. Or do you apply the same values from the training set to the test set, which may lead to over-fitting.

I am confused by this quote below. For example, if you use mode imputation for a class on the training set, should you use mode imputation on the class for the test set, even if you get a different mode? Also, if you use mean imputation for numerical data in the training set, should you also use mean imputation on the test set (meaning you will have a different mean value than the training set)?

""To provide a solid methodology, one should constrain themselves to developing the list of preprocessing techniques, estimate them only in the presence of the training data points, and then apply the techniques to future data (including the test set).""

313,"Hi,

I'm working in a financial firm, analyzing emails to make our client service more efficient.

One of the models I'm working on is to identify and flag emails with potential business impact, ex a client threatening to pull business. I'm pretty sure Amazon does this with their customer complaints and I'd like to do something similar, only I've no training data.

I tried a google search to find similar dataset but didn't get much. I'd love to hear some suggestions on how to approach the problem.

My own thinking is to measure some standard indicators like sentiment, combine it with the number of follow ups the client has sent, the client importance and standardize the result and this can serve as a business impact indicator.",1

317,"I am giving my first steps in data analysis, gathering/cleaning.

To learn, I am trying to create a simple code that can detect heartbeats from color variations from the image coming from the camera on the iPhone.

This is what I have done so far:

I have created a code that detects faces and cuts them from the image.
then I get the average color from that face image.

Because the values are grabbed at irregular time intervals, I have to interpolate the data to convert it to regular time intervals.

Plotting the data I have [this](https://i.stack.imgur.com/bFfGu.png)

I think I am seeing something that looks like heartbeats there.

To confirm that I am not seeing artifacts from the camera, I sample a rectangle from the background and I get the same color with very little random variation. The background color is stable and shows barely any variation.

Now, I apply a Direct Cosine Transform to the data and get [this](https://i.stack.imgur.com/KMg17.png)

The DCT has negative vales.

The two first items of the DCT are peaks, at t=0 and t=0.10482311 seconds.

I read a paper where the researcher says heartbeats occur between 0.4 and 4Hz. I suppose this has a relation why the first two DCT items are peaks...

What do I do now?

I have tried to apply a threshold to zero every term from the DCT below 150 and do an inverse DCT to reconstruct the signal and got [this](https://i.stack.imgur.com/iAOcF.png).

A threshold of 85 gives me [this](https://i.stack.imgur.com/u3ljx.png)

I am not sure if I see a heartbeat there. I mean, the peaks where the beats start.

This is the data at regular time intervals I have (256 samples):

320,"I hope this is the right place to post this....I was wondering if anyone could point me in the direction of a way to help visualize my data problem. I have a product that can be customized to a high degree. however certain choices aren't compatible with other choices. So I wanted to first of all enter the data in some sort of interface and then from that generate a set of rules from it.

Let's say the product is a kettle that can come in 10 colours. It also has 5 different options for handles, but maybe one handle doesn't come in one of the listed colours so that's an illegal combination.  The kettle also has different power button styles. But some of those buttons don't fit certain handles. It also has different power chords, but they're not all compatible with certain handles etc etc. And maybe there are 2 different plugs that fit certain cables. But you don't choose the plug. The system just selects the plug that fits the right cable. You get the idea. Basically lots of lists of what is compatible with what. 

I started to use free online mind-mapping software to draw connections between all the various bits because it leant itself to how I'm picturing the data in my head, but can't do much with that visual. Is there any software that you can recommend for my purpose? One that will allow me to generate rules that I could use in some custom software to allow only valid variants of the kettle? A nice GUI like mind mapping software would be great.

Essentially it's a whole bunch of IF statements but clearly I don't want to have to write them all out. Especially because there are about 20 of these 'kettles'. I just want some sort of list, or spreadsheet that holds all the data ultimately.",1

So I'm actually leaning toward removing my personal github from my resume this time around, because I have all this experience, and kinda don't want people to glance at my insight project from ~2 years ago and see all this clumsy code (it's not *terrible*, but a lot of that project was just painstaking recoding of messy data, and its certainly not as clean as I'd like.  There's also code for a web-app I built using flask, but I had no idea what I was doing there and am definitely not looking at jobs now that will require anything like that).

The problem was that most of my analysis was shit. I spent maybe a good hour and half familiarizing myself with the data i.e. making distribution charts, doing "".describe()"", etc. I basically wasted a good chunk of my time trying to figure out if I could include more features, remove irrelevant observations ,etc. The dataset itself was also tricky so I was thinking of doing some other loss function i.e. the median was zero when the variable spanned \[0, inf\]. I was thinking of maybe trying out robust regression for this problem.

&amp;#x200B;

Before I started modeling, I then wanted to test if the assumptions were valid to employ regression.  All of this was in one big ass lazy notebook.

In the middle of all of this, I noticed I only had like 20 min. left and I didn't write anything down. I tried to clean up my notebook and made some random comments here and there.

337,"I'm an MS student specializing in Data Science and an intern at a start up that has a way to predict revenue using a decision tree and it's really inaccurate. My task was to optimize the current model to make it more accurate, but I told them that I'll probably need to start over using a different algorithm. I am currently cleaning the data (there's a bunch of missing and inaccurate data, but I've managed to clean that up somewhat), and was wondering what type of algorithm I should be using for this? I've got almost 21 different attributes/possible predictors for the revenue for each type of transaction that was done. These include things like the type of service that was used for the transaction, the client, the start date and end date for each transaction, a minimum and maximum estimate of how many hours the person who was involved in doing the work for the transaction, the actual amount of hours it took, and many others. 

&amp;#x200B;

Basically, I want to be able to feed these predictors into the model as that data comes in, which will show that predicted revenue for the end of the month. Any ideas?",1
338,"Hello data friends! I just wanna check in and share my journey over the last few years. It's atypical, and maybe the outcome would not be ideal for some of you but I think it's just dandy for me.

I graduated in 2014 with a double major in theoretical mathematics and behavioral science. Note, that this left me with no applied math like stats, and deep understanding of calculus and a little topology. I struggled to break into the tech world, and wound up doing a lot of random jobs, from retail to manual labor. 


I discovered data science and machine learning through Andrew Ng's coursera in 2016. I did the Galvanize DSi in early 2017, after about six months of self-study. During the job search, I continued working in a labor field I really enjoy (not going into it here, but it involves music, climbing on steel beams 100+ ft in the air, and a lot of rope). I ended up finding some contracts that supplemented that income well, and enjoyed the variety for a bit over a year. One of those contracts required me to learn Golang for ETL work. The same contract had a few opportunities for interesting mini-projects, but nothing really deep or involving machine learning.


At the end of 2018, I asked my boss at that company what the possibilities were for me in 2019, and he was honest. It'd be more of the same, and he didn't have the time or money to offer me more training to focus on development. So, I resumed my job search.

Since then, I did 51 applications. Four responses, three phone interviews, and then something strange happened. I had gotten to the in-person interview at a major organization, and the Golang experience on my resume caught their attention. I was forwarded to an engineering division, did a phone interview, code interview, then finally flew out this week for in-person interviews. No immediate offer, but I was told to ""start packing"" by their director of engineering as I left the building. 

My title and pay will be as a mid-level engineer, but they're hoping I can act as their liaison between engineering and data science and I am BEYOND stoked for the challenge. As I said above, I imagine the more academic folks here wouldn't be satisfied with this outcome, but I couldn't be happier. I'll be moving to an area of the country I love, working on a huge variety of tasks, with opportunities to learn and go back to school. 


It was a long, frustrating road to get here. 100% worth it. I was described as ""a wild stallion, ready to come to pasture and be broken"" in the interview. Uncomfortable description, honestly, but entirely accurate. I've blazed my own trail, and it was scary and uncertain at times, but it's turned out well.

340," Hi,

The idea behind *Black Swans Meetups* is that: if data-scientists meet with new data-scientists, they will discover wildly different (often better) approaches, models, etc., which can be applied to whatever they are working on.

Paul Erdős, the most prolific mathematician ever to have lived, recognised this. He was always travelling around, staying with different mathematicians who gave him new ideas to prove new theorems. His motto was “another roof, another proof”.

I imagine each meetup would be held in some capital city, and data-scientists could go to share ideas, give cool presentations about what they’re working on, etc.

Data is from UCI entitled Dresses\_Attribute\_Sales \[[https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Dresses\_Attribute\_Sales](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Dresses_Attribute_Sales)\]. The gist of the data is that there's 500 entries, and around 13 features. Most of them are categorical, the only one that isn't  is the rating, which is from 1-5. Some categories though have a large amount of factors. At the end column, there's the recommendation (with binary factors) which leads me to believe that either this dress was recommended or not.

&amp;#x200B;

We've only discussed K-Means, and I don't see that being useful here. I've researched and saw Multiple Correspondence Analysis to reduce the dimensions of the features, but that apparently only works if all the features are categorical. Another teacher suggested I create bins for the only numerical data, and apply that, and go from there. Ultimately, my goal is to create a classifier that can classify a dress given features into a yes or no for recommendation.

&amp;#x200B;

I've also read another paper that proposes K-prototypes, but I'm afraid I didn't really understand it all very much, even after reading this medium article ([https://medium.com/@Chamanijks/k-prototype-in-clustering-mixed-attributes-e6907db91914](https://medium.com/@Chamanijks/k-prototype-in-clustering-mixed-attributes-e6907db91914)).

I have to admit I'm fairly new to all these algorithms as such.

Edit2:  just an update in case anyone else is reading this. Me and my partner opted to use MCA to reduce the features, and used a normal kmeans method to get clusters. Data is really messy, but 2 clusters still provides some decent insight. From the 500 instances, we clustered them into 2 - 460 set and a 40 set. It's not very representative coz from the mca, a lot of features and their corresponding factors are relatively close to each other. The other cluster tho revealed some profiles of that cluster that seems sufficiently different the bigger blob. I wanna thank everyone who helped and gave me insight on how to approach this.

I also tend to make mistakes and have a high rate of copy/paste errors, where I forget to change variable names etc. The second issue is a little more specific to me: I am a native english speaker, with basically no formal education in French (I essentially learned French with housemates during my masters), yet I work in a French speaking firm, where all communication with all colleagues is via French. I have gone entire weeks without a single conversation in English. As you can imagine, this burns up a significant amount of brain power and so it is difficult to parse out how much of my current situation is down to me just being a bad data guy, and how much is because I've gotten myself into the ridiculous position of working in a language I'm still learning.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't have any questions as such, but I was hoping to just get a bit of external perspective.

EDIT 2:

Got the official word the other day that I am being let go. In some ways it's a relief to be out of such a crushing environment. And my contract is until April, so I have all that time to find a new role and upskill. Thanks for all the comments and perspectives, it definitely helped ease the blow and help me retain some confidence.

&amp;#x200B;

EDIT: Just to address a couple of points that came up a few times

\- Many of you have basically said, ""chill out, get a new job if you have to, but don't quit the field"". I have definitely considered this, but like I said,  it has been hard to parse out the French part vs my own skill level (and as has been mentioned, management consulting, which I hadn't considered before). My big take away from your comments is that the language and industry probably play a pretty big role in making things difficult and that there's no need to leave the industry. That's great news!

\- In terms of my perception vs my boss' perception: We have had some conversations where the feedback hasn't been awful, but there's been heavy emphasis on the room for (fast) development . My contract terminates in April, upon which I will either be offered a full permanent contract, or be let go (French law dictates that), and so I will actually be having a meeting with my boss soon to discuss my future in the firm. However, all that being said, I fully accept that my perception of the situation is very possibly worse than my manager's.

\- Regarding the French, I wouldn't expect to speak French in a Dublin or London office if a French person wasn't 100% comfortable speaking english, so I don't see why it should be the other way around (nor would my colleagues). And while, as was pointed out, english is indeed a valuable skill for some of our clients, the deal is you have to be able to work on any project in our firm, meaning being capable of talking with both english and french speaking clients, which to be honest, I think is fair enough. In terms of improving, speaking a bit more or asking for help isn't really an option, I am literally swimming in French for 45+ hours a week and I usually speak french with my flat mates, so it's not as if I can make more of an effort- I'm already flat out! Classes are of course an option, but I also need to eat, sleep and be human at some point.

&amp;#x200B;

**Data Workup:**

* Truncate the data to remove anything above the 85th percentile
* Split Training/Testing by year so both sets include a ""bad"" year
* Binned discrete data so each category has equal amount of exposure
* Kept NULL data points as an additional ""Unknown"" category

**Models:**

* Poisson log-linked GLM
* Tweedie log-linked GLM (Using ""tweedie"" R package"")
* Poisson log-linked Elastic Net GLM (Using ""glmnet"" R package)
* Tweedie log-linked Elastic Net (Using ""HDtweedie"" R package)
* Tweedie GBM (Using ""TDboost"" package)
* Extreme GBM

**Model Performance (In order of what I looked at):**

* Maximizing Gini Coefficient
* Maximizing deviance ratio (1- Model Deviance/ Null Deviance)
* minimizing RMSE
* Model Complexity via Degrees of Freedom
* minimizing AIC

The tweedie based packages are hard to extract information out of, so it's hard to compare each model. For instance, I can't figure out how to get deviance ratio from the Tweedie ENET, but can get RMSE and gini.  Poisson ENET performed the best GINI, but had worse RMSE and DF.  The Tweedie ENET had a lower RMSE, but also lower gini.

&amp;#x200B;

Another problem is that when I bin the ordinal discrete data such as ""Year Built"", it loses the monotonic assumption so can lead to some non-intuitive coefficients. Also, I haven't been doing any cross validation, just running a model and just testing it on the hold out. Should I be doing CV even though most are 0?

&amp;#x200B;

Most of the research I've done is using Actuarial and insurance books and most of them suggest using the Tweedie distribution. What else can I do to improve the model?",1

The project is called Deep Learner. This is a project my and my friends worked on during one of the Hackathons I thought it would be appropriate for this sub. The purpose of this project is to allow people prototype Deep Neural networks very very quickly and with writing 0 lines of code. For now you can only build regular dense networks. It also allows for data visualization using Tableau and you can also save models in json format. Please note this is very much work in progress and was made by 4 college students in 24 hours, so there will be bugs. We decided to make this open source, so you are more than welcome to contribute, I have posted a couple issues on github so feel free to contribute.

387,"A lot of companies are creating new data science departments.

388,"My employer, which is a big tech company, just launched a coding challenge for analyzing internal trouble tickets to find a way to reduce costs by reducing the number of unnecessary tickets. The challenge problem is worded in a way that's pretty obvious that they are looking for something along machine learning, though they didn't use the word explicitly.

I spent the last few months learning as much as I could (I have no CS, statistics or math background) about data science, machine learning and text analytics. I came to the conclusion that, machine learning is not cut out for this kind of task without tremendous investment - in time, money and quality training data. I submitted my solution for the challenge using other non-AI techniques, but I'm still wondering whether my assessment of the challenge was ""in the ballpark"".

Basically, the data provided to us for the challenge consists of about 2000 trouble tickets from one particular support department, including all the notes and some slightly higher quality summaries written by the technician at the end of support. 

Without any machine learning, I was able to tell simply by analyzing the n-gram frequency what the most common type of tickets are. Then based on those summary texts and the keywords I categorized the tickets. I suppose if there are enough data (maybe in the tens of thousands), a ML model can be trained to do the same categorization with some 90+% accuracy, but since the data set is way too small, and there's no consistent and reliable tagging on the data, I didn't even attempt it (but perhaps 2000 is not too small?). 

Either way, the real challenge comes after the initial broad classification. The biggest category (including false positives) from my own method contains just over 100 tickets, and under that category, there are a lot of different types of issues (we have a very complex environment). That's not gonna be enough data for any sort of machine learning to properly classify further. Besides, how do we know what are all the types of issues to even create the classes?

So I again used n-gram frequency to find common topics and again used keywords to classify. Was I able to come up with suggestions on how to reduce tickets? Yes, lots of them. Did I use any cutting edge, buzzword technologies? No. Maybe the management is looking for the cutting edge buzzword solutions to help sell out, but I don't think ML, DL, NB or whatever is going to help us here. I have also tried topic modeling, but the output from that was 60% to 80% garbage. I think I know why - trouble tickets note are extremely abstract, with key information hidden in just a couple of words, versus more natural conversations between people which are less abstract (people don't typically talk like dorks). Lastly, I have attempted word association, but the outcome was  pretty much tautology - it just reflects the n-gram frequency analysis.

Of course I want to win the challenge, but my bigger concern is whether the company is heading the right direction - it seems like people are hyped about ML and just want to ride the hype train as far as they can before it runs out of fuel. I believe ML is a wonderful tool on its own, but it's not snake oil. I don't think it can be very helpful in extracting answers to ""why"" from text data of moderate size. With my limited knowledge, it seems like they are asking to first predict whether a ticket can be avoided, and then maybe some unsupervised clustering of all the tickets that can be avoided, it just feels like there's no clarity like the problem of ""recognizing street numbers from photos"".

However I would like to hear your opinion and you experience :) Thank you!",1
389,"I feel like this sub only recommends a degree in statistics or CS for budding data scientists (I literally have not seen a single person on this sub recommend ""get a degree in physics""). But it seems like most tech companies don't really give a crap what the candidate's degree is as long as its quantitative. Some examples of degree requirements for data science roles at top tech companies include:

[Google](https://careers.google.com/jobs/results/6033539515744256-data-scientist-engineering/):

&gt;Master's degree in a quantitative discipline (e.g., Statistics, Operations Research, Bioinformatics, Economics, Computational Biology, Computer Science, Mathematics, Physics, Electrical Engineering, Industrial Engineering)  

[Netflix](https://jobs.netflix.com/jobs/868431):

&gt; Ph.D. in Computer Science, Statistics, Physics, or related quantitative field

[eBay](https://jobs.ebayinc.com/job/-/-/403/11381186):

&gt;Strong quantitative background with Bachelor’s degree in Computer Science, Math, Economics, Physics, Engineering, or related.  

[Amazon](https://www.amazon.jobs/en/jobs/750795/data-scientist):

[Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/careers/jobs/205743826659289/):

&gt; BA/BS in Computer Science, Math, Physics, Engineering, Statistics or other technical field. 

So it seems like in terms of degree, a degree in math, physics, economics or engineering should (at least in theory) be competitive with CS and Stats people. So why do people here automatically say get a degree in CS or statistics for a data science role? Or to put it another way: why do top tech companies not put as much emphasis on a degree in CS or statistics as expected? Seems like they just emphasize the ""quantitative"" part.",1
390,"Hi all.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm here to ask you a question about what should I do regarding my future (hope this is the correct place, if not feel free to tell me where should I post a question like this). Sorry all if my English isn't perfect.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm a student who's going to complete his first degree cycle in Mathematics. Here where I live (Italy), after this first cycle of three years I should go for a second cycle of two more years. I could continue with a course in Mathematics, but I'm starting to think about taking a course in Data science instead. I'm still a lot dubious about this and I would appreciate some help.

&amp;#x200B;

First of all the reason I'm considering the option to change is because of job stability. Continuing with Mathematics would mean trying an academic career, which it happens to be a lot more difficult and less rewarding the more I'm close to it. I definitely love Mathematics and I could also say I'm pretty good at it (not a genius anyway, obviously), but the idea of basing my future upon a risk (you never know if you're actually going to obtain some good results which could open up my way) and of passing a lot of years through not stable jobs, until I can finally become a stable researcher / professor (which is not guaranteed anyway) is starting to make me want to try others ways.

&amp;#x200B;

And so I'm thinking about Data science. I must say that I like Data science, it wouldn't just be for career, statistics has always been something that attracted me. But I like Mathematics more, so choosing Data science would be primary for my future. Still I want to be sure. Obviously I'm looking forward two things: salary and, more importantly, stability. I want to be sure that Data science would actually guarantee me a stable job. If not a stable job at least a stable career, meaning that if I lose my job I wouldn't have many problems finding another one. Moreover I'm planning to move away from my country and I would like to know how much this could be an obstacle.

&amp;#x200B;

In the end is it worth taking a course in Data science regarding the stability of my future? Can I be sure that by studying this subject I could stop worrying about the uncertainty of my job?

&amp;#x200B;

Thank you all for the help.",1
391,"I have a non-quantitative BS and will start a MSCS in the Fall but looking at my program’s curriculum and class syllabi, it does not seem to demand any advanced math. 

Machine learning and Deep learning courses are available but they don’t appear to have a strong theory emphasis. Looks like math is taught in an ad hoc manner. I want to go beyond the scope of my curriculum.

I’d like to be able to understand the average machine learning paper without spending hours on the side trying to learn maths I’ve never seen before. However, I do not need to be able to understand bleeding-edge machine learning papers. 

My current road math:

**Discrete math (propositional/first order logic, relations, mod arithmetic, intro graph theory, mathematical induction and proofs)

**Multivariate calculus

**Applied linear algebra (perpendicular frames, 3D matrices, SVD analysis, matrix diagonalization, Spectal Theorem, Root-Mean Square approximation, etc.)

**Intro to probability (probability spaces, random variables, stochastic independence, special distributions, limit theorems, etc.)

**Statistical theory (estimation, best tests, Rao-Cramer inequality, multivariate normal distribution, nonparametric methods, etc.)

Would this suffice as a good enough mathematical base (i.e. be able to derive new needed math quickly)?

If not, what should I add / topics I need to formally cover?

Real analysis?
More Stat courses?

394,"Hi,

&amp;#x200B;

Since completing my Masters in Data Science, I have had a number of people contact me asking for my experience with the course and whether it is worth recommending. Therefore, I thought it best to summarise my decision for starting the course, what I have achieved during my studies, and the outcome in the years following. I created this article for Medium but thought it would be good to post it here as well to help discussions as I often see questions about Data Science Masters and whether they are worth it. 

### Why did I choose to study Data Science?

It was the spring of 2016 and I was coming towards the end of a 6 month internship at one of the largest consulting firms in the City of London. I had taken this role to gain experience and figure out whether becoming an Actuary was the correct route for my career. I quickly found passion in the data analytics of the role as I was being pulled into meetings to discuss numbers I had crunched or was able hack together a tool to automate previously manual tasks. However, I also found that the traditional track I would be heading on if I moved onto the graduate scheme no longer interested me due to years of standardised exams and little to no creativity. Furthermore, most of my work at this point was within Excel and I was gaining little to no coding experience.

It was at this point I also started to explore a magical term that kept coming up in my job searches: *Data Science*. I had come from a background in mathematics and, due to the nature of the job market in the UK, had been nudged towards the well-founded traditional roles such as accountancy and actuarial consulting. And yet, here was a new role that defied all the expectations I had set for myself of my future career. Where becoming an Actuary I would be solving problems by learning regulatory standards, Data Scientists are encouraged to creatively find solutions that fit within the commercial environment. Furthermore, the role opportunities were no longer fixed into a few select firms but almost all companies were looking for some variation of a Data Scientist and the idea that I could move into a completely new industry, from fashion to finance, greatly appealed to my interests.

However, as I started to apply for Data Science roles it quickly became apparent that **I was lacking two key skills: applying Machine Learning and coding.**

### What were my options?

The first solution was to simply teach these myself, I had the statistical experience to learn machine learning and had done enough coding in MatLab to feel confident that I could learn Python or R. However, if I was to do these I was unsure if this was enough and how I would clearly demonstrate my newly acquired skills on a CV to employers.

I considered online boot camps but they were often fixed in their content and I was unsure of how repeating someone else’s work would be received by employers. Furthermore, there was no guarantee that these were credible to employers and were expensive to self fund. Today, only three years later, the list of courses supported by universities makes this much more of a viable option and is something that is definitely worth considering but at the time these were lacking. Unfortunately, boot camps were a costly risk that I was uncertain would pay off.

Therefore, I decided to look for the options available at universities. At the time there were two types of courses that fit within my goals; business analysts courses and computer science machine learning. The former focused on applying analytics within commercial environments but, as this was run through business schools, was far more expensive at over £25,000 for one year of studying. The latter provided the teaching through academic research and focused more on teaching the underlying theory than the application. Furthermore, as this was an academic course run through the Computer Science department, the cost was considerably less for the year at £9,000 (for UK citizen).

### What did I choose?

In the end, I decided to play it safe and commit a full year to the academic masters in the hope that I would gain the applied knowledge in machine learning and develop my coding skills through project work.

Therefore, I joined the 2016/17 cohort of the Data Science MSc at City, University of London’s Computer Science department. This was the second year the course was offered at this university and, at the time, was the only university in London that offered a Data Science Masters (though others had some variations of this).

### What did I learn in the course?

The first term consisted of the three main topics of Data Science: fundamentals of data science, machine learning and visualisations. Each module consisted of a coursework component that we were given a choice of any publicly available dataset to apply our newly learned methods on. With these, I was quickly able to improving my coding skills and even built the confidence to start sharing [these projects publicly](https://www.philiposbornedata.com/2017/06/27/test/).

In the second term we had two core modules, Big Data and Neural Computing, and were given the choice of two optional modules. The list of options was comprehensive and enabled us to pick specialisms from computer vision to data architectures. I chose Data Visualisations (a continuation of the first term’s module) and Software Agents (the basics of AI by applying Reinforcement Learning). Again, these modules included coursework and with the fundamentals from the first term, I was really able to expand my applications and think creatively. Big Data also introduced text data and natural language processing.

Over the two terms, I had been given a broad overview of most of the Data Science topics and had a deep knowledge of Machine Learning and Neural Networks from the core modules. As we moved into the first component of the course, the dissertation, we were given the choice to complete this whilst in an internship role (and be provided an extension on the deadline to account for balancing whilst working). I found a suitable role, defined my research topic and over the following months applied all the skills I had gained so far towards [applying AI within business](https://www.philiposbornedata.com/2018/03/09/masters-thesis-summary-constructing-a-narrative-using-markov-decision-processes-applied-to-data-visualisations/).

### Did I gain the skills I needed from the course?

I had two goals to achieve; to demonstrate that I understand machine learning and apply these with coding. The course not only provided a clear ‘box tick’ against these on my CV but enabled me to continue to expand my skills after with more and more interesting projects. Part of any job application is to get past the initial checks and I was now doing this much more consistently. Furthermore, as I moved into interview stages, I had all these project to discuss and truly demonstrate confidence in my understanding far more than I would have achieved on my own.

The Masters opened up all the doors that I had previously been knocking on and even had recruiters contacting me directly following the projects I had posted publicly. In the end, I found that I enjoyed the research aspect of my dissertation and the freedom to pursue the field and have since move onto a PhD in Artificial Intelligence. Ironically, this is the last thing I would have considered back in 2016 but as the field is constantly expanding it is incredible to be at the forefront of this, particularly because many problems require an applied mindset and fit within commercial problems and are not simply theoretical.

### What advice would I give to someone considering moving into Data Science?

This is always a hard question for me to answer as each person’s position is different so will try to offer some advice based on my experience. In short:

1. **Establish** that Data Science is the right route for you and find a topic or detail to motivate this. For me, it was the ability to apply data analytics in a creative way and become a valuable asset in a business to help others improve their decisions.
2. **Evaluate** what the jobs you want are asking for and where your set of skills currently fall short. Although I had the technical background, I had not demonstrated my ability to apply machine learning or code and needed something to achieve this. For others on my course, they had not come from maths or stats backgrounds and so needed these to strengthen their knowledge.
3. **Review** the options available to you to gain these missing skills. For example, boot camps are increasingly more credible in the industry but they are often following a single path (i.e. learn on the same data and apply the same methods). This may work for some but I wanted to demonstrate my abilities in unique ways to stand out to employers. If you are considering a masters, thoroughly research the modules and who is organising the course as variations will exists between different departments, particularly business and academic schools.
4. **Expand and challenge** yourself through the course, don’t simply pick a course that covers topics you are already comfortable with to tick a box. Find something challenging that will encourage you to develop new skills.
5. **Demonstrate** your new skills by publishing your projects online, either through GitHub or Kaggle or your own site. Building a portfolio of project has taken me further in any interview than trying to describe these within the time limit would allow.

&amp;#x200B;

I hope you find this post useful if you are considering how to get into data science and will do my best to answer any questions you have about this. Am UK time so will most likely reply to questions tomorrow morning when I have some time.

**""What are the qualities or traits which differentiate good data scientists from the best data scientists? How, if at all, can these traits be learned or acquired?""**


Panelist Answers:
_______________________________________________________
/u/creampuffcrusader:

The best data scientists I've worked with had these two traits:

**A deeply rooted paranoia about data quality.**

Starting out a project by trying to replicate KPIs and current domain knowledge before jumping into the new and exciting work. Talking to stewards of the data about any quirks they ran into and taking the time to understand the data generating process. This can be learned either from mentor-ship or from experience. For me personally - it was combination of both mentorship and collecting battle scars.

**Holding themselves to the scientific method***

I had a mentor who was a data scientist before it was cool. He started the quantitative supply chain practice at the firm I work in back when the data scientist equivalent position was called Principal Analyst. He had this motto when interviewing stakeholders:

Tribal knowledge is a hypothesis unless there is evidence.
He had this uncanny ability of organizing knowledge by what has been verified, what can be verified, and what is interesting but maybe out of scope or not testable. And using this categorization to efficiently guide us to a quality analysis or product. Really - he was just very strictly holding himself and his team to the scientific method. It was remarkable.

This trait can definitely be learned. But it takes patience and experience.

_______________________________________________________
/u/amadeusmagrabi:

In my experience, the best data scientists are the ones who have **an intrinsic drive to deliver value for the business** and are **able to think outside the box to make sure that the whole team has the highest impact.**

Good data scientists ask their manager what the project requirements are, do their research, deliver a clean and thorough analysis, communicate their most important findings clearly and then ask what they should work on next.

Great data scientists take a more active approach and think about their work with more context. They ask what the larger goal of the project is and challenge the core assumptions. They have ideas for how a project could also benefit other parts of the company or raise awareness for potential conflicts that could occur down the line. They are informed about new frameworks or techniques that come out and suggest innovative ways how they could be used to improve a process. They are genuinely interested in how the business as a whole works and actively talk to people to understand their perspectives. They are full of ideas of what they should work on next. They pride themselves on how many people they helped and not on how complicated the technique they used was.

Importantly, they do all of this because they care about the impact of their work and not because they want the attention or boost their career. They do not start a discussion just for the sake of having a discussion and they are able to step back when their opinions did not resonate with others.

*As to how to acquire these skills:* 

If you do not have a data science job yet, this is hard to prepare. But it helps to read blog posts in which companies from different industries share how they get value out of their data (there are plenty of those on Medium).

Once you have a job, ask as many questions as possible without being too annoying and talk to everyone in the company. Do not be shy and just sit in front of your data. Constantly ask yourself why you are doing what you are doing, if it still makes sense or if there is a better way. Get involved, be curious and let others know about your thoughts. The more feedback you get on your thoughts, the better you can fine-tune your work to the business context.

This depends on the role of the data scientist and the company.

In a tech company where seconds (and milliseconds) matter, then your knowledge of algorithms, statistical learning, and programming matters a lot.

However, if you're in a non-tech company, where data scientists tend to be more ""decision scientists"", and the transactions happen across days or weeks (think buying a car), then the ""soft-skills"" tend to dominate...things like understanding the business, iterating rapidly, and explaining results to non-math/non-engineering executives.

Both are learn-able. However, in my experience the latter (soft skills) are harder to teach.
_______________________________________________________
/u/dfphd:

There are three things that come to mind:

* **They are driven by outcomes and not methods - but can do either well.** 

The best data scientists I've met are the people that are willing to put their ego aside and cobble together a less elegant answer in two days than a more elegant answer in a week because that's what's right for the project. That's not to say that they cannot put together a complex, elegant solution to a problem - when the problem/project calls for it, they can roll their sleeves up and make that happen. But their bias is for getting results, not getting methodologies.

* **They say ""yes"" more often than ""no""**

It's really easy to say no. We can't do that, that can't be done, that won't work, no, no, no. Really good data scientists say yes - knowing that they may need to change the question for it to work, but understanding that they can likely figure something productive out.

* **They build strong relationships based on work credibility**

These people tend to do more than just be good at their job - they seem to always manage to leverage the quality of their work into really strong relationships at work, which in turn helps them be even more effective by having a lot of people who are willing to go to bat for them when needed. I think the first two attributes tend to help in building these relationships, but there is extra effort and time that they dedicate to cultivate these relationships over time.

Learning these skills, in my opinion, is largely driven by introspection, i.e., identifying that your objective should be to become as effective and efficient as possible, and that you may need to modify your behaviors, your habits, your comfort zone in order to become that person. Once you can legitimately convince yourself that these are skills worth developing, the rest becomes an exercise in keeping yourself honest - in constantly call yourself out when you are being a method-diva, when you're being a naysayer, and when you're marginalizing your relationships at work.",1

416,"Do you all have any best practices in structuring projects (i.e. directory structures for storing data, scripts, exploratory notebooks, etc.; naming schemes; breaking questions/tasks into pieces for teams to tackle in parallel)? This is a little ambiguous and certainly dependent on the specific project and/or field, but I want it to be open ended. Interpret it as you will.

Personally, I am sort of a ""hobbyist"" data scientist (I am a biologist; my ""data science"" type work is all on my own time), so all of the ""data science"" type things I do are exploration of open source biological data (RNA seq, protein-protein interaction databases, anything on the Allen Brain Institute's website; i.e. ""data-science-lite""). I'm usually testing out one-off ideas, looking for interesting ways to combine open source data, and seeing if I can gain any insight into my own project. 

I generally have separate directories for raw and transformed/joined data. I keep scripts in the directory in which they were applied to make it easier to keep track of what I did at each step of the process, and I keep exploratory/debugging notebooks in the parent directory. I also try to keep metadata files in each raw and transformed directory, but to be overly honest I am the only person working with any of it, so I tend to slack quite a bit on creating the metadata.

I haven't come up with any naming schemes that seem to work for me consistently, and since it's just me exploring data to see if I can use it for my own projects, I generally have no need to break it into smaller pieces to be executed by a team.

My approach has a lot of short-comings. In particular, I end up with data files haphazardly named and scripts spread chaotically throughout the whole directory structure. I can usually trace my way back to what I did, but it takes some time. This is particularly problematic when I try to return to a project with a new idea; I spend as much time remembering what I did previously as I do executing the new idea.

I'm just curious what you all do to structure your projects. I've not seen much here in the way of describing best practices in organizing personal or professional projects, so I thought I'd toss the question out to the community.",1

1. data analyst is more manual job, you work with business, produce reports, presentation not software;
2. you will not gain right coding practices and you will not be learning about modern machine learning/statistical techniques.

440,"TL;DR: I did a performance analysis of my production classifier and would like to know what's the method that you guys use, and whether there are any flaws to my idea.

&amp;#x200B;

I work with text mining and the most important model that I have is a document classifier. It classifies if a particular document is a contract or not.

&amp;#x200B;

My team created a pipeline that fetches documents, OCR them, classify them and make them available in a web application, so that our users can find them way faster than by using the other methods.

&amp;#x200B;

The classifier was trained with 1K documents and deployed with &gt; 90% F-score to production (I did the training, testing and validation stuff to prevent overfitting). We then needed to tell the stakeholders our classification accuracy, because of that, I sampled 1K from the 33K classified documents and we manually annotated the sample so that we could calculate the number of contracts labeled as not contracts (false negatives) and the number of documents that were not contracts but were classified as contracts (false positives).

&amp;#x200B;

I then looked at the false positives and false negatives for patterns, after finding patterns in the errors, I created regular expressions that reduced the error for some patterns, and re-trained the models for the other patterns that came from new documents that were entirely different from the samples we had in the initial dataset. After updating the model, the F-score went up to &gt; 90% again, and we got better results when looking in the web application, so the problem of performance was solved. BUT, I think my approach to this problem was very intuitive and not very science-y, so I figured out another way of doing this, a more statistical way.

&amp;#x200B;

What I'm thinking about doing in the next time, is to make a [sample size calculation](https://www.surveysystem.com/sscalc.htm) using the total of documents in production as the population, confidence level of 95% percent and confidence interval of 3%. Then do a random sample of N documents, annotate them and calculate the F-score.

&amp;#x200B;

Now, my fellow data scientists, I would like to know how you do this kind of performance monitoring for classifiers. Also, do you think that my idea has any flaw ?

&amp;#x200B;

Another thing, my new idea will use a confidence interval of 3%, does that imply that the score that I calculate after annotating documents from my random sampling will have a range of +- 3% ? For example if I calculate a F-score of 94%, does it mean that my F-score, actually is 91-97%, because I did a sample of the population ? Or am I oversimplifying things and this is not how confidence intervals actually work ?

442,"I recently accepted a position where I have access to a really nice Linux server (56 threads 256G Ram) and we are currently in the process of getting access to an even larger server (100+ threads with 2TB Ram) -- we have a lot of heavy lifting to do. At my previous position I used a server with remote desktop and it was clunky so I'm trying spend some time getting familiar with a good setup early in order to increase my productivity and workflow later. I'm looking for recommendations on workflow. Here is my current workflow setup:

* Jupyter-lab server
* Rstudio server
* ssh tunnel from server to localhost on a Macbook Air or Fedora Workstation desktop through Chrome
* localhost:8000 to load up Jupyter-lab
* localhost:8001 to load up Rstudio

I generally write scripts in Jupyter-lab or Rstudio and once testing is complete I open up a tmux shell on the server and run code straight from the command line -- I use tmux so I can monitor it throughout without the need for being connected to the VPN. This has worked well so far but it still feels a bit clunky. Ultimately, I think a vim-python in one tmux pane and ipython in another would be ideal where I can Ctrl+enter send commands using vim-slime. I've tried this setup and it works, but the config is somewhat of a hassle and I need access to quick plotting to check data processing commands and model run outputs, which is not possible with ipython in the command line. An `ssh -X` would solve this, but now I'm adding things that seem excessive.

Having never worked elsewhere as a data scientist I’m not sure if it’s just my company though.

For most of the time I’ve been here I have not had any work to do.  I feel like I’m massively underutilised, and I do nothing of value.  When I actually have a project to work on, I spend most of my time aimlessly trying to create ML models when in reality the data I have does not fully explain the values I’m trying to predict.  I have no deadlines, so I have no pressure to model quickly.  Nothing I’ve done goes into production.  I’ve stretched what should be week to fortnight-long projects into months because I have nothing to do.  I’ve literally had only 6 half-projects since I’ve been here.  I feel like I’m trying to find things to pass the time with, and it’s really starting to affect my mental health.  I like to be kept busy.

Also, none of the data scientists collaborate on projects, we’re all assigned our own work, which I feel is possibly not the norm.  It's really lonely, and I feel projects would get done a lot more quickly if we worked together.  We also never have code or project reviews, so I have no idea if what I’m doing is correct or not.  I taught myself to code in the language we use so honestly my code is probably horrendous.

I’ve tried to find my own projects, but it’s such a large and global company that it’s difficult to know where to start.  When I have managed to create my own projects, it’s taken MONTHS to get the data, so I just sit around waiting.  In the absence of anything else to do, I've been teaching myself web development.

It’s got to the point where I’m really considering changing to a software engineering/developer role as I really enjoy coding, and I feel like software engineering is an inherently more interesting and collaborative role.  Is it?

Is my experience typical for a Data Scientist, or is it just my company?  Should I try moving to a data science position elsewhere before abandoning it completely?

I've always been interested in computer science, especially with ML and AI. I read many books about it our of pure interest.

My friend suggested that I do a data science masters because he said its basically statistics + computer science.

461,"Hello everyone, 

Long story short: I am a Data Scientist that works for a fortune 500 company in Brazil, and wants to relocate to Europe, but would need sponsorship because I only have Brazilian citizenship. Was a software engineer that transitioned to DS and I work with text mining right now. 

I would like to have some advice on what I should focus on next to maximize my chances of getting a Data Scientist position to relocate to Europe. There are a lot of different fields to work on and I feel kind of lost on how to proceed. 

Since Europe is very big, the options that I envision are:

- The Netherlands
- Germany
- UK
- Ireland
- Switzerland
- Belgium looks good as well, but I would need to study this country a little more to decide. 

Any one of them would be good, since I know that relocating inside Europe is easier once you're there, in case I'm not compatible with my first option. Also, I'm not picky about salary, having enough to pay the bills and eating out two times a week is enough for me, I know I can build upon my opportunity with time. 

I think it's important to give you details about my background, so that you have more information to work with. 

### My background

What I can do:

3+ years experience with software engineering before switching to Data Science so the programming, SQL, NoSQL and ETL stuff is a no brainer to me. I know how to deploy math models using Python and also know infrastructure, docker, Linux, Kubernetes, scalability, networking, etc etc. (I worked as a sysadmin for a year)

I am working with document classification for 1 year already, using TF-IDF + SVM + regex rules. I also do metadata extraction from the text (client name, document id, etc). I have hands-on experience with random forests, logistic regression, NaiveBayes, etc, the standard stuff for text mining. Classification is one of my strengths. 

I know how to explain these complicated concepts to business people, one of my presentations to a C-level executive on how word vectors could be used for a problem made me receive very good feedback from him. 

I am responsible for understanding the problem with the business people so that I can know which problem to be solved first to have better results to then solve it using ML/DL/whatever solves it, I also make the decisions on how the problem will be approached. 

I also know quite a bit about sentiment analysis, since it's what I do in my spare time. 

What I cannot do:

I don't know R (it would be easy to learn R, but I got lazy in that part, Python looks way simpler)

I just have very basic and  theoretic knowledge of regression, that part of DS is not used in my job because I do classification, so I never got past that famous real estate dataset.

I also have very basic and theoretic knowledge of clustering, I know it is very useful for profiling customers, recommendation and all that, but didn't get past KNN and K-Means examples, just the basics. 

My statistics kinda suck. I'm working on that right now by learning on online courses and trying to apply it to hypothesis testing in my work. But I still struggle with how to use random sampling, the exact meaning of confidence interval, p-value, F-test, T-test, etc etc. This is one area that I don't feel confident about. 

My math is not that strong as well, I struggle to understand the underlying maths on state of the art papers. But I don't know if knowing the obscure details of CNNs helps more than being good at using them in a practical setting (avoid overfitting, for example). 

My question is, based on my strengths and weaknesses, what skills should I focus on to have a bigger chance of getting a DS position in Europe? Customer clustering, A/B testing? Financial stuff? Object detection using CNN? Time series forecasting ? Should I stay in text mining and be VERY GOOD at it and search for positions in that field? Or should I know a little bit about everything and pray that it is enough to land the job, to then get very good at something ? 

Will a masters in science help me on getting a sponsored visa position? Or is it more about what I can / cannot do in practice, instead of academic success? 

I have a B.Sc in Computer Science BTW. 

My favorite area of study is computer vision, but I don't see a lot of job postings about it.  ",1

464,"Hi All. I'm having a first world problem dilemma... and would love some advice from people who have been in a similar situation.

I am currently very privileged to be living the ""data science dream"". I work as a product data scientist for a big tech company in Silicon Valley, my work is appreciated by my stakeholders and peers, I am well paid (TC = $160k for 3yoe + stock), and I feel like I am constantly learning new things at work.

I am not originally from the US, I relocated from France where I am from, and would like to move back at some point, to reconnect with family and friends. My original plan was to stay 3 more years from today, and continue saving as much as possible to move back with some savings, with the prospect of retiring early.

However I am realizing that not only salaries will be significantly lower in France (we're talking 3x lower), but the prospects do not look so exciting from a DS perspective (e.g. archaic corporations who look for data analysts, or startups who use words like ""neural networks"" in every sentence).

Anyone has been in a similar situation and would be able to provide some guidance?",1

466,"So you want a coveted internship? This answer is mainly geared towards software, but can be applicable to any industry.

I have some tips that helped me get my first software engineering internship in Silicon Valley, right out of my coding bootcamp. I break down some of the best ways to get an internship as quickly as possible, as easily as possible.

Whether you studied computer science in college, went to a coding bootcamp, or are self-taught, these tips will help you through.

If you prefer video format, here’s a video I made covering these topics:

[https://youtu.be/eyzKYYwB0ng](https://youtu.be/eyzKYYwB0ng)

The first main tip is to start as early as possible. Bigger companies who have the most internships available start early in August, September, an October with posting their internships. The earlier you start, the higher chance you have at beating the competition.

The second tip, and probably the most crucial one is to use your network. Using the back door to get your foot in is much easier than using the door that thousands of people are using (the automated online job portal). You can use LinkedIn, Facebook, and word of mouth to find people who worked at specific companies. On LinkedIn, you can use search queries like \[Insert college here\], and then use people filters such as 1st /2nd-degree connection, location, and company. This helps hyper-target your audience.

The best people in your network to reach out to are:

\- College / coding bootcamp alumni who work at the company you want to work at

\- Friends / classmates who interned at that company

\- Professors / mentors who might have connections with that company

\- Friends of friends who work there (use Facebook to search this - “friends of friends who worked at \[X company\]

The next tip (this is crucial, and will save you a ton of time). Don’t send your resume off into a black hole (such as Indeed, Glassdoor, etc) and do nothing else. My rule is for every job app you send into an online portal, you need to connect with one real person as well. There are a handful of ways to connect with a real person at this company - use a Gmail plugin like Clearbit Connect, or Hunter io to find peoples’ work emails by company search (give them a quick Google - you’ll see what I mean). These are extremely powerful tools. Then, send them a quick note:

\~\~\~

Hi \[person’s name\]!

My name is \[your name\], and I’m an \[type of engineer\] in \[location\].

I’m reaching out because I applied to \[company\] regarding your \[position\].

I have experience with \[this technology, skill, etc\]

Following up, I've provided my resume and cover attached letter below.

Would someone on your team be open to chatting more about this role by \[insert date to add time pressure\]?

Thanks so much!

\[Your name\]

\[Phone number\]

\~\~\~

Following up after they’ve responded:

Would you be willing to connect me to the hiring manager for this position per chance? I'd greatly appreciate it!

Thanks so much!

\[Your name\]

\~\~\~

The most important thing is to not be annoying. If they don’t respond after following up once or twice, try another person at the company.

If you’ve used the last 2 tips (network, reaching out) and have finally connected with a real person, you can ask them “How can I stand out in the intern application process for \[X\] company?”, or even better, ask to buy them a coffee and pick their brain about their experience working at the company, the company culture, and to see if you’d be a good fit.

Another way to stand out is to have an amazing portfolio. This isn’t absolutely necessary (at least for Software Engineers), but will help you stand out above the crowd. My tips here:

\- Host your projects on Github (clean up code, add ReadMe, etc)

\- Add your projects, with screenshots and descriptions, to your LinkedIn experience/projects section

\- Create a video outlining your design decisions, tech choices, etc (I did this when applying, and it definitely helped)

\- Deploy your projects to the web, and have a landing page which can direct people towards them

The next tip is to prepare for the technical interview. If you’ve gotten this far but fail the technical portion, chances are you won’t make it further. They can give you any question, but your goal is to be familiar enough with basic concepts, so you can adapt on the spot. Using sites like LeetCode can help improve your technical ability. It also helps if you’ve seen similar questions to the interview ones - LeetCode will help you with this. Sites like Pramp help you practice interview skills live, which is another surefire way to get feedback and improve your chances at doing well. Take a few deep breaths before you walk into the interview, and you’re ready to go because you know you prepared!

The final tip I have (and one that sped up my job search tenfold) is to track EVERYTHING. There’s a Gmail plugin called streak that allows you to track your job search in a funnel. Streak also allows to send template snippet emails, and you can see if someone has viewed your email. So handy!

I customized the funnel by tracking:

1. Company Name
2. Position Name
3. Contact Name
4. Contact Email
5. Contact LinkedIn
6. Date of Last Contact
7. Job Source
8. Job Posting URL

If you’re not a fan of Gmail plugins, you can also use a spreadsheet like Excel, Google Sheets, and my favorite (spreadsheet/database mix) Airtable! Airtable is a solid option, because it allows you to link different tables, attach documents, and organize things with ease. An Airtable tutorial would take a whole other post, but I encourage you to check it out!

The job search is ultimately a game of failure, persistence, and triumph. You ultimately need to create your own luck, and this happens by widening your pool. Start applying to as many places as possible! These tips I shared above allowed me to apply to 150 jobs in 3 days! Most of the time I ignored the cover letter (do they really matter, anyway?) and focused completely on connecting with a real person. That’s what will ultimately start you on your journey.",1

I'm just wondering what managers are looking at when they look over the assessment. I'm already doing this in a language that is not my strong suit at their request.

**Boring explanation for people who've never watched**

For the Non-US among us, March Madness is an annual basketball tournament similar to the knockout stages of football (single-elimination) that is used to determine the best college basketball team in the country  (think of it like UEFA Champions league but much more compressed in terms of timeframe). Since college basketball teams play in separate conferences (think domestic leagues), there is no way to claim bragging rights of the best team in the country. It's referred to as madness because the tournament takes place over 2 weeks and anything can happen (like giant-slayers in the FA cup if you're a Brit).

475,"Hey guys.

I want to discuss about something that is itching me right now.

I recently posted in the weekly Entering thread. I am a student in mathematics and computer science who is studying to become a data scientist. I am currently learning C++ by myself and was told to transition to Python ASAP. I was reading a Data Structures and Algorithms book (in C++) during that time (and still am, spoiler!)

So I did my DD and told myself why not learn that subject in Python to learn the language at the same time? There's where it became more problematic. I understand fully that for someone who wants to become a data scientist, Python is mandatory since it has these beautiful libraries for machine learning &amp; co. But the problem I faced is that when I wanted to implement my own data structures in Python, I realized that so much is done under the hood that it's pretty much impossible to get an in-depth understanding on what is happening, and to optimize stuff on ""my way"".

So my question goes as follow : Since optimizing is a huge part in a data scientist job, and playing with data structures/optimizing algorithms is also so important, why is it not pushed more to get a core undestanding of it? I understand you can use stuff that you don't understand completely, but for someone who's JOB is to use it, shouldn't he understand at least the fundamentals?

I want to hear your opinions!

PS: Just to be sure, I am not ranting on Python, I am saying it's hader to get a grasp on the core because it's all done out of sight. I am not saying C++ is better either, I am asking why people do not recommend to learn a lower level language (any!) before learning Python.

Thank you guys.

477,"(Sorry for such a long post; main question is at very end.)

I have finally received an acceptance letter for a Statistics grad program (yay!), and plan on leaving my company in late summer to go back to school full time.  I currently work as a data analyst for an automotive supplier, and my boss is aware that I will be leaving the company, and he will be working with HR soon to start the process of finding (and potentially using me in part to train) a replacement.  Thankfully, everyone is very supportive.

I was the first person in the company, so far as I am aware of, who does ""data analysis"" and has a statistical background, novice as I am on paper in that matter.  I am not very happy with the way my job is currently structured and would have planned on leaving anyway if I had not gotten an acceptance.  My work is not very well defined; there are data management issues (like storage, access, standardization across sites) which slow work; and I do not have anyone in my company who is able to double check my work from a statistical POV—or even more preferably, elevate it to (and appreciate) a higher sophistication.  While officially on a team, I am not on a team of people who do what I do, and am very independent anyway.

I have been asked to help craft a job description for my replacement.  However, while I can easily regurgitate my current responsibilities onto paper and list what skills I have found useful for executing them, I would like to expand this task to communicate back to my employer how best to structure such a job, from hierarchy of needs they should be considering in order to streamline the data analysis process (instead of merely filling roles I have been haphazardly shoehorned into, and ignoring needs which subsume them), to better establishing specific duties to achieve those ends (instead of giving the next person as much autonomy as I have).

I would like to do this, and have come to this community for feedback on how to do so, for two main reasons: (1) I myself need to grow and manage my expectations for what a better data analysis or data science job looks like, and (2) I would like my successor(s) to experience that better if I have some latitude to reform it.

To give a rough outline for what I would like to learn and communicate back to my company, posed as questions:

- **What are the standard vertical and horizontal structures surrounding a technical job like an analyst?**  Right now, I receive work not only directly from my boss, but also often directly from different people in the company (some high up) who are aware of me and the statistical skills I provide.  Sometimes these projects do not have established timelines or well-defined metrics or goals, and this creates disorganization and workload/expectation problems.  After working like this for some time, it seems to me that a wiser system would be for projects to be administered through management, and interactions between groups (such as, a chemical test lab group and my group (myself)) to ultimately start and end from above.  Is this misguided?  How do project management and team interactions work in well-functioning systems?

- With deference to some of the prior considerations, **what sort of environment (have you found) works best for a data analyst to thrive in?**  For instance, I feel that I would have liked to have another person on my team who does what I do so I could bounce ideas off them and assert my own expectations better.  I also feel that the rest of the company isn't very good at managing their own expectations for what a single data analyst can do, and my position as an almost independent service provider within the company speaks to that.  How are data analysis teams organized and how do they manage the request-result cycle?

- **What functions often go underserved in a company starting to sophisticate its data analysis process, and what skills should it seek out to fill those?**  As I mentioned above, there are non-homogeneities in how data is collected and stored and made accessible between different manufacturing or test sites that we have, and some projects that they would want to work on in the foreseeable future will involve more sharing of this data between sites.  Data is often dumped into a ""vault"" specific to each site (with very limited read access), and can be made available in a hodge-podge way on a network we have.  It doesn't seem conducive to accessibility.  I am also woefully underinformed on the full extent of data management at our company, so the problem may just be my level of knowledge; but the prescription nonetheless may be bringing in someone with the skills required to interact with the data we have, even if vaulting and networks are enough.  Who works behind the scenes that a data analyst depends on?  What skills should that person have?

- Finally, **How can I combine the above into job description(s), for employer and prospective employee alike?**  How many people make a good team?  What should they each bring to the table?

These are the things about which I will likely ask more follow up questions.  That may come when I have done some more thorough investigation into what expectations and gaps people in my company find for data analysis.  I also may not be asking the right questions, and I may have different ones depending on the feedback I get here.

Right now though, I think this is my question for this post:

How would you characterize a ""good"" and functional data analyst role and what does their team look like?",1

479,"I released a new version of my Debian packaging for JupyterHub (https://github.com/1and1/debianized-jupyterhub#jupyterhub-debian-packaging). It makes the installation of a fully working hub on a Debian or Ubuntu server easy, with everything already installed and compiled (no build tools needed).

The package comes with a fully equipped Python3 kernel – the scientific Python stack and common visualization frameworks are built in. All additional packages beyond the JupyterHub core are organized into setuptools ‘extras‘. You can select them for inclusion (many are added by default), or remove unneeded ones to reduce the package size, by changing the “debian/rules” file.

On an Ubuntu / Debian workstation, using this package you get readily available notebooks for personal use, without the need to start a notebook server on the command line every time you want to edit a notebook.

Technically, this is a self-contained Python3 venv wrapped into a Debian package (an ""omnibus"" package, all passengers on board). You can build the package in a Docker container, so that you don't need to worry about installing build dependencies – the Dockerfile does that for you, without affecting your workstation or build host.

For more details, check out the GitHub README (see link above).


Changes since 0.9.4-3:

  * Extras: Added 'docker', 'nlp', 'ml', 'utils', and 'vizjs' (included by default)
  * Extras: Added 'arrow', 'nltk', and 'parquet' (optional)
  * notebook: update to 5.7.6 (CVE-2019–9644); also updated other explicit requirements
  * Tornado: kept at 5.x because of compatibility problems

483,"I was offered a data scientist job at a unicorn fintech firm with an established data sciences team. It was my first interview for a data scientist role and I had to interview with over a dozen people including multiple leaders within the company. Even before I was invited for a face to face interview, I underwent a coding assessment (timed). I usually do not do well in timed challenges as they make me nervous and I can get flustered easily. They rejected me after the assignment (I received the news while I was waiting in the lounge of another company getting ready for my final interviews with the second firm for a Developer role). 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

But after the rejection, I decided that it wasn't the best assessment of my performance and I took all the feedback the team had for me and re-did the challenge over the course of next week. I reached out to the company again with my results and asked them to reconsider my work (with little expectation). I think the company liked my initiative and they invited me for onsite interviews. I said yes to this since I had another offer for a different role from a startup. My onsite interviews were average at best and shitty at worst. I felt I did not do well and went to bed at 5 in the evening. I could not answer questions from past since most of these questions were from five years ago. During the technical interview, the interviewers were looking for a very specific answer, but I had zero clue on what exactly they were looking for. I felt comfortable defending my work, but that's about it.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

By next noon, I got the dreaded call from the recruiter and she tells me that they really liked me (very puzzling). They wanted me to do a few more interviews with the team since the team wanted to be sure that I knew my shit. Now, to give you a quick idea about my background, I don't have much data science experience outside of some projects I did while on my free time and my startup which focuses on visual data. So I was pleasantly surprised that the company gave me an offer in like two hours after I finished my final interviews.

487,"I'm currently a senior data scientist in a small startup in Boston. I'm looking to change companies in the next year and want to begin getting experience leading a team. My current startup is very small and flat organizationally. I basically own the production machine learning pipeline and don't work closely with other team members on it, so no opportunities to manage juniors, etc.

My goal is to eventually be in a VP/Director of Data Science position and recognize I need experience leading a team. Our engineering group uses Agile (loosely) and believe this is common for many companies.

Given that I am looking to make a job change in the next year, should I pay out of pocket to get the Certified ScrumMaster designation ($1K USD and two days of classes)? Would this be a differentiator when interviewing? I'm thinking it may provide signal that I'm committed to developing as a project manager/leader, and also be valuable in its own right. 

And before this gets raised, yes, I understand that my chief value will be based on my core technical skills as a data scientist. I am already heavily invested there. FWIW, my background is PhD in engineering from a great school, 4 years experience in risk consulting for nuclear/defense industries, 4 years data science/machine learning experience.

I'm not sure if this is the exact right sub for this question--I posted it over in r/jobs as well but I was hoping to get some feedback from people in my field if possible.

I was wondering how much flexibility telecommuting employees have as far as where they work from. For some context, I currently live in New York (In Data Science / Analytics) but my SO may be doing a degree program in England. I don't want to fully give up my NY residence if I don't have to, so I'm looking for remote opportunities which would allow me to work from either the US or the UK. My ideal situation is one where I could spend 2 or 3 months at a time in either country, while working remotely full time. Is this possible? Most Remote Data Science opportunities I've seen say something like ""Work from anywhere in the US"" but I'm not sure if this means you can't work outside the country, or just that you need to be based in the US (citizenship, resident, paying taxes etc). I'm born and raised in the US so that wouldn't be an issue.

&amp;#x200B;

So for anybody here with experience in a remote analytics role, were you free to work from wherever you wanted, provided you had a good internet connection and made yourself available during business hours?

494,"Incompetent interviewers are so frustrating. Companies really need to do a better job of screening the people they allow to conduct interviews. 

So the situation was that I was in an interview process with big company that has a big AI group. I finished my second phone screen two days ago. The first one went really well. I really liked the person. I answered all of their technical questions and I received an email that they wanted to move forward.

The second guy was pretty weird. He didn't introduce himself, and I had to stop him to ask his name. He then proceeds to ask me about the one non machine learning project on my resume. I start to tell him about it, and he asks 

""Well do you have any ML experience? Because we do a lot of that here.""

Well then maybe you should ask me about the three other ML projects on my resume which you clearly didn't read until you asked me that question. I then started to tell him about one of the ML projects on my resume. He asks a few questions in that annoying way, where interviewers try to poke holes in your work to try to through you off balance. I'm thinking ""Dude I worked on this for a year. I know what I'm talking about."" I answer his questions and he seems satisfied.

He then asks me a few basic ML questions (e.g. explain linear regression and SVMs). I easily answer those. He asks me a coding question, which I also easily answer. Throughout this whole time he's challenging me by asking questions on things that he clearly doesn't understand that well. He tried poking holes in my solutions, usually by saying things that we're just wrong, which led me having correct his understanding of basic things (e.g. What is a random variable). I try my best to do it politely as possible.

He then says that he doesn't have anymore questions and if there's anything I want to ask him. I ask a few basic questions about the company, and we call it a day.

I get feedback today that they're not moving forward because of my lack of knowledge of NLP. Dude didn't even ask me about NLP. If he did he would know I'm pretty freaking knowledgable about it. We ended the interview 15 minutes early, which I don't maybe he could have used to ask me about NLP if it's so important. 

What's really frustrating to me about this is the AI group there is really large and the fact that I had a problem with this interviewer doesn't mean I wouldn't fit. In other situations I would just say ""Well at least I don't have to work with him."" But from talking to the other guy, I think I would have actually fit in really well there, and I just had bad luck by getting this one guy as an interviewer.

Anyway I guess there's not much I can do. Rant over.",1
495,"This is kind of a rant, but I see so many people who parrot the sentiment that ""data science"" degrees are a joke, or that it's ""just applied statistics"" and that there's a stigma.

I come from a pure math background and I've seen mathematicians say very similar things about statistics or physics or CS: ""oh that's really just applied math"" or ""they are not really rigorous like math"". And I found that incredibly annoying and I guess the reason why I get annoyed by this sub's hate for data science too.

I see people coming from data science or business analytics degrees from schools like MIT, NYU, Carnegie Mellon that do just fine. Obviously these are good programs and there are countless other shitty data science programs not worth their salt. But it's the same thing with degrees in statistics or CS, innit? Yes, the popularity of statistics and CS means these master's programs have been sprouting like rabbits too. It's not just data science.

Over the years I have obsessed about how to make it easy for every one to build their resume. Using some AI magic, I ended up creating a site (a side project) that allows you to create a resume for free. Here’s the link: [https://thisresumedoesnotexist.com/](https://thisresumedoesnotexist.com/)

I've used [https://github.com/minimaxir/textgenrnn/tree/master/textgenrnn](https://github.com/minimaxir/textgenrnn/tree/master/textgenrnn) to generate the text by feeding it data scraped from various resources. My script runs in a ""while true"" loop and generates a new resume every 3-4 seconds. Resume is then saved to S3 and the same resume is loaded via CloudFront for all users.

I plan to make it more and more awesome, like you add your name and designation and it fills up your resume. But, I thought it would be nice to get a feedback from you folks and see if I can add the to my to-do for the side project.

I’d the following thoughts on why I started working on it:

\- I knew a guy who got a job at Google, who previously couldn’t get a job at an IT agency just cause his resume wasn’t good enough

\- Not all of us have the skills required to write creatively and organize it. That doesn’t mean you don’t qualify for a job

Things like these are weirdly still a hurdle for many (it is going to be 2020 next year!). I want them not to be a hurdle anymore :slightly\_smiling\_face:

So, pitchfork me if you hate what I built, but if you loved it or have any suggestions do share your thoughts with me. Appreciation will make my day, critique will help me shape it.

(I’m also interested in how this might relate to Bain’s [Macro Trends](https://www.bain.com/insights/topics/macro-trends/) practice.)

&gt;At a time when private equity firms face soaring asset prices and heavy competition for deals, advanced analytics can help them derive the kinds of proprietary insights that give them an essential edge against rivals. These emerging technologies can offer fund managers rapid access to deep information about a target company and its competitive position, significantly improving the firm’s ability to assess opportunities and threats. That improves the firm’s confidence in bidding aggressively for companies it believes in—or walking away from a target with underlying issues.

**Questions:** Does anyone here use their data science skills for private equity research or economics for a consulting firm like Bain? What is that work like? What tools do you use, and how would you recommend someone interested in making a switch to that field? Any recommended resources to learn more about that career path?

**Background:** I currently work as a marketing strategist, I’m starting a dual-degree MBA/MS in Business Analytics in the fall with elementary programming and math experience (though I do have an MA in humanities).

in our company, my Data Science team is currently struggling with the 'last mile', i.e. have our insights and predictions bring about actual change.

We have sufficiently mastered the technical aspects, with APIs and platform at our disposal and available to others. Also, we've established trust with senior management executives.

What remains is to convince coworkers from other departments, e.g. sales, to work with us. Many hesitate to cooperate or to make use of our results and our work, and I feel like this boils down to a couple of human reasons:

* The generally resist change, especially when initiated by others
* Their division manager might have a long-standing rivalry with our division manager
* They see us and our suggestions/results as 'invading their territory'
* They view us as young and snobbish know-it-alls

How would you approach this problem? 

As a last measure, we could make our case with the executive level and have them pressure their guys to cooperate. However, we'd really like to solve this problem 'bottom-up' instead of 'top-down'.

* Responsible for identifying emerging trends and their feasibility for your company, and to own the technical development of data science initiatives for your company/major function (e.g., Finance, Sales, etc.)
* Expected to be most technical person in the organization, and serve as subject matter expert for both junior data scientists and senior business leadership.

Knitty is language agnostic and can be used with any Jupyter kernel. Can be used independently of Pandoctools and with any IDE of choise. So I guess it deserves a separate post. By the way: Atom/Hydrogen is also language agnostic. You can also try **VS Code** interface to Jupyter from [**vscode-python**](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-python) instead of Atom/Hydrogen. I highly recommend to try to think about ipynb as merely an output format like pdf instead of main format or intermediate format (albeit ipynb is great for presenting narrative interactively and it can even [be much more](https://github.com/kiwi0fruit/misc/blob/master/src/pdf_and_word_killer.md)).

Our team recently prototyped building reports using Tableau and management absolutely loved it. However, our concern is the amount of business partners that might come to us going forward to help build dashboards for them, which would be overwhelming.

Few Questions:

1. What do you think works better? A centralized or decentralized model? 
2. As a business unit, we are by no way ""IT"" and would want not want to maintain every single dashboard we build going forward.
3. Do you guys have a Tableau ""center of excellence"" to train other users in the organization on Tableau?

My understanding is that deep learning is ""less transparent,"" in how it works, whereas ""traditional machine learning,"" is more transparent.

519,"Hi, i am what in the industry is called a data scientist. I have a master's degree in statistics and for the past 3 years i worked with 2 companies, doing modelling, data cleaning, feature engineering, reporting, presentations... A bit of everything, really.

It seems impossible to me to get employed. I pass the first interview, they give me a take-home test and then I can't seem to pass to the following stages. The tests are always a variation of:

* Work that the company tries to outsource to the people applying, so they can reuse the code for themselves.

* Kaggle-like ""competitions"", where you have been given some data to clean and model... Without a clear purpose.

* Live questions on things i have studied 3 or more years ago (like what is the domain of tanh)

* Software engineer work

520,"I recently got my first job as a data scientist and wanted to share some thoughts about the job hunt process and tips I found helpful for landing a first gig in the field.

&amp;#x200B;

Some background (without giving away too much PI): I had a varied education and career path to this point. Both my BSc, MSc, and PhD were in STEM fields. I decided to make the switch to data science after seeing some friends have success in the area.

&amp;#x200B;

I had no formal experience in data science/AI, although I had much coding experience (mainly python and matlab) from my degrees. So I decided to self teach data science and then apply for jobs. There were many ups and downs in the process as a whole, and a lot of lessons I learned as I went along in the job hunt.

&amp;#x200B;

To form a solid understanding of the machine learning field, I started by going through a machine learning primer on [pythonprogramming.net](https://pythonprogramming.net). I found a nice mix of math theory (low level) and code. The course covered all of the main algorithms used in machine learning by first explaining the behind the scenes idea and then coding a algorithm from scratch and then (in some cases) using it on a dataset. Towardsdatascience also is great (for the right author) for getting a quick easy overview of something.

&amp;#x200B;

After this I applied to my first round of jobs, and found that this is probly not enough to get in the field. I got a few interviews, but response rate was about 7% of my applications (applied for about 50 jobs). I applied for all jobs online, via indeed, glassdoor, etc. While applying I started an excel file listing all applications and dates applied. This gave me a way to measure response rates and see what helped increase this.

&amp;#x200B;

So, after realizing I needed something more, I took on a new undertaking. I reworked through in depth math of the popular algorithms using Elements of Statistical Learning (textbook freely available online). Then, I found some data sets online (either off kaggle or the UCI repository) and went through an entire in depth project on these sets. Data cleaning, exploratory analysis, predictive. I mean really clean out the problem, I read publications about the dataset, established baselines, interpreted results, etc. I then made a github account and made a data science portfolio and posted a couple of projects on there. Then I reopened the application process and applied to about 50 more jobs. IF YOU TAKE AWAY ANY ADVICE TAKE THIS: make a porfolio and post a project. Choose a project that is socially relevant and any layman could see why its interesting (ie healthcare, not Gaussian data distributions). This astronomically increased my responses. I would estimate that, per 20 applications, I got interviews for 5-6 jobs. After much interviewing I finally got a good offer which I accepted.

&amp;#x200B;

Interviews follow the same basic structure everywhere, and here's what I learned going through them:

1. The HR screen. After bungling a couple of these I finally figured them out; after an HR screen now I would say I have a near 100% conversion rate to a second round interview. They don't know technical stuff, they want to get an idea of who you are and make sure you aren't a weirdo and can articulate yourself. So here's how to ace them: find a project you worked on and explain the technical concepts to them in VERY easy to understand ways. I found explaining algorithms using sports analogies very effective. Relate the project to someone who doesn't care about data science; why is the problem interesting, what are implications of your results. Besides that be prepared to answer the basics like ""why are you interested in this company"", ""how do you face challenges"", etc.
2. 2) the technical interview. The contents of this stage really varies. Most times, I would be asked to explain technical aspects of my DS projects. They would start off with ""explain a project youve worked on and how you solved it"". Why did I use this algorithm and not another, why did I do a dimensional reduction, how did I clean the data, etc. Then, I would get asked to explain the workings of a particular algo I had used. Some would ask that I explain it to someone who didn't know about computers, and some would ask I explain the math and algorithm structure. If you paid attention to my first point you'll be ready for the layman explanation. So be prepared for both. I would really prepare a nice ""lecture"" about an algo, because some would just say ""explain your favorite algorithm"".  Some will go through your resume and ask you to explain buzzwords, so be prepared for that.
3. 3) the coding challenge. These are annoying. They are generally easy, most I got were binary classification problems. A couple I got were just data sets and they said ""do something interesting"". If you've done a DS project it shouldn't be hard. The annoying part is that most would say ""this should take about 4 hours, heres 5 days to turn it in"". So what I imagine happens, is some candidates spend 4 hours and get some interesting insights and send it off, and others spend 5 days straight doing a crazy analysis of it. One company arranged a time I would like the challenge to be sent to me, and I had to submit results within 4 hours. I think this is the best format, as it really puts everyone on the same playing field. I would suggest doing a very simple practice classification problem from a common dataset (the UCI wine thing for example) and just get a ""template"" ready that isn't too difficult to change between basic datasets. Also, some jobs that blasted me a dataset without a phone call or email first I found quite rude and didn't pursue.

&amp;#x200B;

Final tips: I know many people on this sub complain about buzzword resumes; but Ill offer a different take. The people who get a giant pile of resumes to sort through are the HR people; I had a friend who is an HR rep for a DS company look over my resume. These HR people don't know DS; they have a job description for a role that has buzzwords in it (candidate should know regression, tensorflow, blah blah) and they match your resume to that. So I found that by including buzzwords  (listed algorithms I knew, math I knew)  I increased my response rate.

&amp;#x200B;

Also I added a section in my resume explaining the DS projects I had done and tools I used to do them (bold font the tools for fast reading), this also increases response rate (link to your github portfolio too). All in all, the job hunt process is a meat grinder and sucks. I sent out a total of about 100 job applications, got a couple cheapo offers that I declined, and accepted a solid one. I completed about 30 interviews. The whole process took about 3 months. The jobs I didn't get interviews for I think is because I didn't match the description exactly or didn't match the experience requirement, lots of them want big data framework experience which I didn't have (hadoop, apache etc). This would be easy to learn, but the screeners don't know this really so probly tossed my resume. I would've learned it myself but getting 4 coding challenges a week bogs you down a bit :P.

&amp;#x200B;

Remember, the increase in interview requests and inceased knowledge is not just a correlation, it's a causation. As you're applying, learn something new everyday.",1

522,"My company currently has a bunch of disparate marketing data sources coming from places like google AdWords, Facebook ads, Bing ads, commission junction, and many others.

We're two friend who met in college and learned Python together, we co-created a package which can provide an estimate for the training time of scikit-learn algorithms.

Here is our idea of the use case for this tool:When you are in the process of building a machine learning model or deploying your code to production, knowledge of how long your algorithm can help you validate and test that there are no errors in your code without wasting precious time.

As far as we know there was no practical automated way of evaluating the runtime of an algo before running it. This tries to solve this problem. It especially helps in the case of heavy models when you want to keep your sklearn.fit under control.

Let’s say you wanted to train a kmeans clustering for example, given an input matrix X. Here’s how you would compute the runtime estimate:

    From sklearn.clusters import KMeans
    from scitime import Estimator 
    kmeans = KMeans() 
    estimator = Estimator(verbose=3) 
    #Run the estimation 
    estimation, lower_bound, upper_bound = estimator.time(kmeans, X)

### Why build ""a minimalist scheduler""?

A few months ago [I asked what the sub thought about current data pipeline technologies](https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/9uz05o/whats_your_opinion_on_current_data_pipeline/). The consensus was that Airflow was the best option, but every popular option requires significant resources to learn and implement.

I'm a data scientist working on a young product. I made that post at a time when we were unsure how to automate our data pipeline. Airflow is free, sure, but things weren't breaking yet and the time investment made Airflow an expensive option for us. We decided to point CRON jobs to shell scripts instead. It was fast, cheap, and easy to debug in the rare event of failure. It wasn't a permanent solution; it was a good-enough-for-now solution.

I revisited the problem a couple months later, and I realized there must be hundreds of teams like mine in this limbo: still unable to justify the cost of Airflow and growing too fast to rely on CRON and shell scripts. Clearly there's a need, yet there was no such scheduler that I could find. 

I started engineering my own solution. I didn't need all of Airflow's features. I thought, ""What can I take away from Airflow to make scheduling more accessible?"" I took away the UI. I took away the sqlite database. I took away asynchronous scheduling, bash operator, and triggers. I kept the scheduling, dynamic configuration, python operators. I even added some functionality to support virtualenv, pipenv, and conda environments. 

What remained was Dequindre: a minimalist scheduler I could setup in minutes. It's production-capable too. We're migrating to use Dequindre on my team at work. 

### What's Next?  

Dequindre v0.10 marks the start of ""public beta testing,"" which means I'll be answering public bugs, questions, and feature requests. I'll release Dequindre v1.0 when I'm confident the core functionality is tight. Right now I guess that might be April or June. There might be a v2.0 and beyond, but Dequindre is minimalist by design; there's only so many features I'll consider adding before recommending something more full-featured like Airflow. ",1

529,"Background:
I work as a lead project manager for a very large company. I am good at my job (or at least my yearly performance reviews say that) but I honestly don't like my job. I am regularly given failing projects and tasked with replanning the project. The stress is wearing me out. I want to work in data science - I'll have my MSc in data analytics within the year and I'm working on creating a portfolio and getting my first data science job. I incorporate data science techniques into what I do and I credit that with what makes me successful.


Situation: 
My company is very antiquated and slow to adopt new technologies. At the end of last year they announced they were going to start embedding data analysts within teams and hire some data scientists. I thought great, here's my chance to get into the field. 


I cannot get an interview to be a data analyst because, according to the hiring manager, I don't have experience. It's frustrating because I regularly demonstrate the application of the needed skills and knowledge, but okay fine.


Fast forward a few weeks a newly hired data analyst is imbeded with my team. I try to make the best of it and think, hey, I can talk data science with this guy.


The person hired doesn't have a background in data science. He doesn't know statistics or any programming languages. He had to ask me for help writing a simple SQL query so he could put the data into Excel and make a pivot chart. The hiring managers are business people who don't know anything about data science. The data analysts are being used as Excel jockies.


I don't fault the people hired as data analysts but it frustrates me that the managers have no idea what they are doing in regards to hiring and utilizing data analysts. I feel like within my company they are devaluing data science by having people not in the field doing the hiring and management of the analysts. It's looking more and more like I'll have to leave the company to work in my desired field. That will be difficult because I'll likely have to take a pay cut to get a job elsewhere.

533,"To be more specific, I am talking about the situation where you have deployed a binary classifier (could be multiclass) into production where you are taking actions on people based on the predicted outcome score from the classifier. One thing I have been thinking about is what kind of metrics to use to validate the confidence of the actual score outputted by the model. e.g. If a model outputs a score ('probability') of 0.74, what is the expected chance that the predicted event will actually occur?

&amp;#x200B;

The initial assumption might be that there is a 74% chance but that seems to be confusing the model's score with a confident probability which doesn't seem right. I've also looked into MC DropOut as a method of estimating confidence, but I'm curious about situations where Neural Networks aren't in play. My initial guess on how to approach this would be to deploy the classifier for a while and collect data on it's predictions and the actual future outcomes. Then, taking all of the predicted scores (that we take no action on), I would bin them up so that there's a bin for all the predicted scores in \[0.7, 0.75\] and a bin for predicted scores of \[.85, .9\], and so on. Then, I would calculate the average proportion of people that had the event occur, and would expect roughly 72.5% of the people to have the event occur in the first bin, etc.

&amp;#x200B;

But, I'm wondering if there is any way to quantify this better? I'm guessing research has probably been done on this and I just haven't come across it. Any ideas on good lines of research to look into, or maybe examples where this is already being done?

&amp;#x200B;

543,"I recently had an interview for an entry level data scientist position. At one point the interviewer scoffed at using sklearn or other similar packages because: 1. he didn't ""trust it"" and 2. his data ""wasn't the kind you could just plug into a [model.fit](https://model.fit)()"" but was more ""nuanced and complex"".  For those reasons he instead builds all of his machine learning models from scratch. In my opinion it stuck me as a bit arrogant to think that an open source software is to be trusted less than something one or two people have fully reviewed.  But I'm also not sure of how many situations there are in which there is no available library or prepackaged model, or it is more advantageous to DIY.

Few questions here:

1. Does anyone else here find standard machine learning libraries such as sklearn untrustable? If so why? Are these models not to be used in production for some reason I'm not aware of?
2. How often does a data scientist really need to build these models themselves? Or put another way how big a project does it need to be before meriting a self-built approach? e.g. I can imagine prebuilt models being the go to for quick analyses but when company's core product is centered around a machine learning algorithm it may make sense to build it from scratch. I'm wondering what it looks like between those two extremes.
3. In what scenarios is it preferred to build a model from scratch? I can understand the situation where a library or language isn't available in a production environment, or the model needs to be written in a different programming language. I'm more interested in cases where this is a decision from the model builder and not imposed by infrastructure requirements.

After being in industry for a while I've observed there tends to be about 4 main different flavours of 'data scientist':

**Data Analyst**

5 or 10 years ago, these people would've just been called BI analysts or data analysts- just doing basic data viz, reporting, dashboards and SQL querying. Then companies started to try and sex up these positions by giving them a new buzzword title 'data scientist'. There may be a few of these people who do some basic ML and stats but in my experience this is uncommon. Usually good with tools like Tableau etc

**Statistician**

Again, 5 or 10 years ago, these people would've just been called statisticians or mathematicians. They focus mainly on inferential modelling or if they do predictive it's using traditional statistical techniques like linear regression. These guys are highly skilled in stats theory and some in ML as well, but they tend not to have great CS/software engineering skills, and usually their work consists of ad hoc analyses that they aren't responsible for delivering to production. Typically program in R, or in more old school organizations maybe something like SPSS.

**Machine Learning Engineer**

This is where the major growth area in 'data science' has been in the past 5-10 years IMO. These people typically have good CS/Software Engineering skills and are involved in deploying models to production. They tend to focus mainly on predictive models and most will be in strong in more 'modern' ML techniques, but some (not all) may be weaker in 'traditional stats' models. Work mainly in Python but may drop down to lower level languages when required.

**Data Engineer**

These people range from plain old DBAs rebranded to Big Data Engineers who work with Spark/Hadoop/Cassandra etc and work in Scala or Python or maybe even Java. The Big Data Engineers might also be proficient in the ML libraries specific to their particular big data architecture.

To me, all of this begs the question, should we just ditch the terms 'data science' and 'data scientist'? In my opinion, they are vague, generic buzzwords that do nothing but confuse people. Be interested to hear other people's thoughts though.

I'm currently looking for a budding data science teammate to build out and expand on the analytics for an app I'm working on. What's a good place to look for budding data scientists looking to grow the resume/portfolio?

**Background**:

Last year, I spent several months studying data science in hopes of working in behavioral health analytics. I loved it, but grew tired of analyzing random datasets for my portfolio; I really wanted to analyze my own data, but wanted to automate the process as much as possible. I switched over to web &amp; mobile dev and began work on the app in React Native. After several months, I finally launched the app in December. I was proud of the product, but also recognize that it needs some love, especially on the analytics side. Soon after launch, I landed a mobile dev gig at a startup and haven't had time to sit down and do everything solo like I used to. It has a (very) modest user base and I want to continue development on the side. It's obviously just volunteer work - the app is currently free - but I'd be happy to chat about options if it goes somewhere!

Anyway, many thanks. If this isn't the sub to look, my apologies. If you do know where I might find interested souls, please let me know!",1

On the other hand, I am currently dealing with a project that doesn't need any predictive models, but contains lots and lots of data to be explored, analyzed, summarized, and re-organized (rich geographic datasets can be quite multidimensional and messy). As the result the project directory looks approximately like this:

Does anyone have experience dealing with such projects? Date based project/notebook naming seems quite interesting (e.g.: `2019-03-05_thing-to-analyze-1`), but I'm afraid it might make it harder to understand which stuff is old and which stuff has been recently revisited.

Unfortunately it's not that popular question. Sometimes it turns into [Cython/Numba/C/C++ battles](https://github.com/pydata/sparse/issues/126).

There is a discussion of this issue: [Why Julia? Will Python/Numba and Python/Cython lose to Julia?](https://github.com/numba/numba/issues/3814). And I cannot foresee any solution to this disarray except maybe [interop at the C level](https://numba.pydata.org/numba-doc/dev/user/cfunc.html#example). If there would be a PEP specification for such API then it would be even better. But I guess the solution to this should be as pythonic as possible (mentioned Numba tools to create C functions in a pythonic way are really good).

But I'm not sure how scalable is interop at the C level approach (it's merely my lack of knowledge). Can there be compositions of compositions?

## Python to Julia transpiler

In contrast to Python Julia language doesn't suffer from lack of unified API and it constantly enriches packages ecosystem that can be easily combined. Now it even has a stable release. This actually brings another possibility to fix the problem mentioned.

It would be nice to have Transpiler from subset of Python with special module named like ""Juthon"" to feature-complete subset of Julia (sometimes there are more than one way to do something in Julia).

And a idea looks like it should both be:

1. Standalone transpiler so that the user can write ""Juthon"" package and contribute it to the Julia ecosystem by transpiling.
2. Runtime decorator style transpiler (with interface like Numba has) that calls Julia (or compiled python library in the future) from Python. So that a small piece of code can be added right in the Python app written in Python.

I wonder if 2. possible though... If not then something like [enaml import](https://github.com/nucleic/enaml) can be tried that wraps transpiling and wrapping of Julia call. This can even be preferable approach.

A good example of a transipiler from Python is [Transcrypt](https://github.com/QQuick/Transcrypt/issues/619) that is a valid Python prior transpiling. But to achieve 1. this should be more like Julia in Python syntax than attempt to implement Python's standard library.

I guess it should be done via IDE friendly mapping and juthon module with source to source mapping for Julia autocompletion and lynting passthrough as it seems that automatic creating of typed and documented python stubs would require more work than source mapping; for example Julia to python transpiling for other modules inspection. That would mean lack of type inspection inside IDE - errors should be displayed by jit transpiler and later julia compiler.

The convenience matters a lot.

When I pressed them on my professional communication being lackluster they said no, that it was great for communicating with our clients and within the office. I asked them why they felt I needed further development, and their response was that I should know how to sell our product and services so that I could give presentations to clients. I told them I have no interest in learning how to be a salesman, attending sales meetings, or being involved with the sales side of the business.

Naturally from here I started thinking about what the digital equivalent to shorthand would be and I've thought of some random ideas that may have a place in a similar system:  
   
  

- Text expansion, if you went crazy with this then there would likely be a huge learning curve.  
- Using a typed shorthand system like [keyscript](http://keyscript.wikifoundry-mobile.com/m/page/Alpha+Shorthand+Systems), then decode it with some ML system, although I'd imagine that this would have a lot of challenges.

587,"I'm an experienced data scientist (I actually lead a large team) and am reasonably literate about computers, though I am not a developer or IT professional. My organization is split roughly 50/50 between Python users and R users (and a few unicorns who are proficient in both). The general consensus, with which I don't disagree, is that R is generally better for data analysis/exploration/visualization because of dplyr and 
ggplot2 (tidyverse), and Python is generally better for machine learning because of sklearn, Keras, and Tensorflow. And yet, R is good enough for machine learning (mlr, caret) and Python good enough for data analysis/exploration/visualization (pandas, matplotlib) that you don't \*really\* need to learn the other unless you stumble upon some problem for which there is no library in your preferred language.

I started out using R when I got into data science because the guy who was showing me the ropes was an R guy. I was able to quickly and easily get RStudio installed on my machine, load up the packages I need, and start learning the language. R has plenty of quirks, but it has served me well over the years and I am able to do pretty much anything I need to do with it short of really complicated deep learning, which isn't really a requirement at the company I'm at anyway. For nearly all of our ML problems, some combination of linear regression, random forests, or XGBoost will get the job done. And mxnet actually works pretty well for deep learning in R.

However, I always want to expand my skillset, and I have tried several times to work in Python. The first time, a friend showed me how to set up a Jupyter Notebook and I was able to get some basic things working in that after several hours of trying to set it up. The biggest pain was realizing that I had to install Python on a path without any spaces in it and then go set my Windows path variable to get it to work. I eventually decided that R tools suited me better and went back to R. I tried again a year later when I wanted to play around with deep learning and was able to get TensorFlow working after **several** **days** of wading through their never-correct documentation, scraping message boards for help, and eventually finding a blog post that solved the rest of my problem. Then I decided that the syntax was way more complicated than it needed to be (I wasn't aware of Keras yet), and went back to using mxnet in R.

The other day, I discovered the reticulate package for R and have been trying to get it to work, with no success. I have read through all the documentation, tried using conda\_install() and use\_python() to create a virtual environment with all the libraries I need, but it is failing to find numpy. On the reticulate page, my exact situation exists as an open issue and there has been a long chain of discussion but no resolution. Several hours down the drain.

My point is, RStudio installed just fine on the first try. All the packages load and work pretty much right away. I've never had to worry about keeping several version of R on my machine or changing any environment variables. I haven't had to spend endless hours digging through message boards just to get R to *run*. I really want to learn to like Python, but it *really makes itself hard to love*. I'm too busy to spend days and days setting it up and tweaking things. Why hasn't one of the most popular programming languages in the world been able to get some *basic* things right such as, ""You can run this installer on Windows 10 and it will work out of the box""?",1

Objective: Binary classification of whether transaction is fraud (1) or non fraud (0).

Finally, I predict using the autoencoder on the fraud class (1) data and calculate the Reconstruction Error on that data.

I am a budding data scientist working for a major municipality. In 2018 we started as a small data science team of 4, working from our laptops. Eventually, we got a linux server where we could host our work and deploy our first model on. However, this server is hosted outside of our company's architecture.

During this time, our municipality is making a hard push to become data driven, including automation of data entry, storage, and an overhaul of our IT architecture. I feel this is an excellent opportunity to take our data science team to the next level, and try to push for a small but complete architecture that can help us deploy our models internally. This would be a major help since we could directly connect to the existing databases (where now we have to use manual extracts to feed our models).

However, this is where my knowledge gets stuck. I have been reading up on things like linux, spark, docker, etc. But it's difficult for me to form a comprehensive overview of what architecture is standard for data scientists, and (maybe more important since I have to defend and push for this) why we would need this. 

For example: I try to push for docker implementation in order to shorten the gap between our new engineering team and the end product of data scientists (since the engineers want to use docker too). However, I don't know exactly why docker works so well for this and why it is better than other tools. However, I need to know this in order to defend our choices.

2. Upvote the ones you believe are important core skill sets, but DO NOT downvote any other skills if you disagree/don't know is key. If you don't agree with a skill set not being core, simply don't upvote.

617,"This is a little lengthy but I hope you find the story interesting and would greatly appreciate any feedback.

Some history that brought me to this point:

* Transitioned from a Software Engineer to Data Scientist role \~5 years ago, while working at a mid-sized software company in an extremely niche market in a smallish city.
* Got the opportunity to work on some run-of-the-mill problems (data analysis, classification, forecasting) and not so run-of-the-mill problems (rebate optimization for cooperative purchasing / buying groups).
* The business was interested in the results but never interested in moving our data science initiative forward as they weren't really forward thinking.
* My role slowly transitioned to managing the development and implementation of a new reporting solution using a software problem plagued with bugs, affording me less time to maintain existing models and continue to innovate; less time to practice data science.

As a result of the last event, I decided to look for another job with the constraint that I wouldn't be able to leave the city. Since there isn't a huge tech presence here, the frequency of data scientist job postings is about 0-1 times per quarter. Lucky for me, one popped up and I jumped on it, I was getting pretty miserable going back to managing a dev team at the company I'd been working for for 7 years and felt like the move was long overdue.

Not only was I desperate to get out of my current role, but the context and scope of the posting appealed to me - a data science role at a multinational company within a large (\~150 person) finance team (finance as in cost and management accounting and internal audit). Within the team I would be data scientist #1.

I haven't come across any literature on data scientists embedded within finance teams so I thought this would be a challenging albeit rewarding opportunity if I could innovate in the accounting space. The organization has a dedicated data science team focussed on innovation and run-of-the-mill user experience and revenue problems which admittedly sounded a little sexier but the team is located in another city.

My concerns:

* I accepted a slightly lower salary though it could be more if I'm awarded a discretionary bonus, based on overall company performance, and maximize my retirement savings investment matching plan.
* I have left a software company that was starting to embrace modern technologies (Azure, Docker, Angular, more reliance on web services) which would pave the way for the adoption of ML / AI in some of their products though we were probably 2-3 years away from it.
* The company I have accepted a job at seems very focussed on a small subset of problems which mostly could benefit from some data mining at best as they feel that opportunity exist but we need to discover it. For example, my first task is to complete a project that the previous person who was in my role had got to about 80% completion with. One of my short-term responsibilities is to establish KPIs, build some dashboards for users in operational and strategic roles, and help converge on a change management strategy since analytics is foreign to a lot of people at the org. Once the project is complete, they want to keep trying to extract insights for the particular problem, rather than exploring new use cases.
* I'm going to spend a tremendous amount of time trying to integrate data from a very heterogeneous set of sources from different providers (lots of time on the phone and exchanging emails), rather than have an eng team work on it.
* In line with above, I'm afraid that the organization will become obsessed with pumping out reports or that I will spend the next two years bringing them up to a basic level of analytics maturity.
* When I say ""predictive models"" they think ""financial forecasting"" rather than classification models for e.g. expense categories and feel that even financial forecasting is something ""we are a long ways away from"".
* I'm starting to fear there are limited problems in accounting on which the full breadth of data science can be brought to bear, leaving me with irrelevant experience and ""behind the times"".
* **My future job opportunities at technology companies (which is eventually where I want to end up given the scale of the problems) will be impacted since I'd be coming from a non-technology company, even though I have 9 years experience working in software.**

The good:

* Lots of opportunity to interact with stakeholders, working to understand their business problems, and developing creative data solutions to address them.
* The opportunity to present findings to senior management (CEO, CFO) of company that generates more than $1bn a year in revenue.
* A manager and executive sponsor who seem very excited to become a ""cutting edge"" finance department with respect to technology and analytics capabilities, even though they aren't aware of the all the possibilities.
* I have the opportunity gain valuable change management experience.
* I have the opportunity to work with my manager to build a team of data scientists and analysts if we get a few quick wins.

The big question that I keep asking myself is ""Should I stick this out and put my full effort and passion behind it to make the initiative a success, or am I being overly optimistic in my pursuit of bringing the full breadth of data-driven decision making to a finance department?"".",1

I would like to share my personal data science project on how I analyzed my weight loss data in 2018. You can read my [writeup](https://link.medium.com/9KJRGuzsqU) on the project on Medium, and check out its Github [repo](https://github.com/dknguyengit/logweight).

The 2 main goals for the project are:

* Build a machine learning model (namely regularized logistic regression) to classify whether I would gain weight or lose weight on a given day given how many calories I eat beyond my allowed budget and my step count for that day. The parameters of the model (the regression coefficients and the decision boundary) are also used to give simple, actionable numbers that I could use for my weight loss journey.

* Build this machine learning model from scratch without using 3rd-party libraries (aside from numpy and pandas). This includes the model algorithm (batch gradient ascent), k-fold cross validation, performance metrics, ROC curve, and other related visualizations. This turned out to be not as intimidating as I'd thought. In fact, the core algorithm for batch gradient ascent can be done in 3 lines of code!

I've tried to tailor my writing to be accessible to beginners (as I'm also a relative beginner to data science). Therefore, I'd truly appreciate any input on how I can make my writing and visualizations better.

Also, I'm thinking of doing to do a 30-day challenge, during which I followed the guideline outlined in the project, and see how consistent I can lose weight doing so (perhaps via daily updates through a Twitter account). I think it might be fun to use this as a real-life test set for my model, but I'm afraid of the potential public failure 😭 If you've read my Medium post, please let me know what you think about this idea.

Please also let me know if you have any question or feedback on my project!",1

When should you do pre-processing to avoid over fitting?

Do you do it both on the training and the test set, which may give you different values. Or do you apply the same values from the training set to the test set, which may lead to over-fitting.

I am confused by this quote below. For example, if you use mode imputation for a class on the training set, should you use mode imputation on the class for the test set, even if you get a different mode? Also, if you use mean imputation for numerical data in the training set, should you also use mean imputation on the test set (meaning you will have a different mean value than the training set)?

""To provide a solid methodology, one should constrain themselves to developing the list of preprocessing techniques, estimate them only in the presence of the training data points, and then apply the techniques to future data (including the test set).""

My own thinking is to measure some standard indicators like sentiment, combine it with the number of follow ups the client has sent, the client importance and standardize the result and this can serve as a business impact indicator.",1

699,"I am giving my first steps in data analysis, gathering/cleaning.

To learn, I am trying to create a simple code that can detect heartbeats from color variations from the image coming from the camera on the iPhone.

This is what I have done so far:

I have created a code that detects faces and cuts them from the image.
then I get the average color from that face image.

Because the values are grabbed at irregular time intervals, I have to interpolate the data to convert it to regular time intervals.

Plotting the data I have [this](https://i.stack.imgur.com/bFfGu.png)

I think I am seeing something that looks like heartbeats there.

To confirm that I am not seeing artifacts from the camera, I sample a rectangle from the background and I get the same color with very little random variation. The background color is stable and shows barely any variation.

Now, I apply a Direct Cosine Transform to the data and get [this](https://i.stack.imgur.com/KMg17.png)

The DCT has negative vales.

The two first items of the DCT are peaks, at t=0 and t=0.10482311 seconds.

I read a paper where the researcher says heartbeats occur between 0.4 and 4Hz. I suppose this has a relation why the first two DCT items are peaks...

What do I do now?

I have tried to apply a threshold to zero every term from the DCT below 150 and do an inverse DCT to reconstruct the signal and got [this](https://i.stack.imgur.com/iAOcF.png).

A threshold of 85 gives me [this](https://i.stack.imgur.com/u3ljx.png)

I am not sure if I see a heartbeat there. I mean, the peaks where the beats start.

This is the data at regular time intervals I have (256 samples):

702,"I hope this is the right place to post this....I was wondering if anyone could point me in the direction of a way to help visualize my data problem. I have a product that can be customized to a high degree. however certain choices aren't compatible with other choices. So I wanted to first of all enter the data in some sort of interface and then from that generate a set of rules from it.

Let's say the product is a kettle that can come in 10 colours. It also has 5 different options for handles, but maybe one handle doesn't come in one of the listed colours so that's an illegal combination.  The kettle also has different power button styles. But some of those buttons don't fit certain handles. It also has different power chords, but they're not all compatible with certain handles etc etc. And maybe there are 2 different plugs that fit certain cables. But you don't choose the plug. The system just selects the plug that fits the right cable. You get the idea. Basically lots of lists of what is compatible with what. 

I started to use free online mind-mapping software to draw connections between all the various bits because it leant itself to how I'm picturing the data in my head, but can't do much with that visual. Is there any software that you can recommend for my purpose? One that will allow me to generate rules that I could use in some custom software to allow only valid variants of the kettle? A nice GUI like mind mapping software would be great.

Essentially it's a whole bunch of IF statements but clearly I don't want to have to write them all out. Especially because there are about 20 of these 'kettles'. I just want some sort of list, or spreadsheet that holds all the data ultimately.",1

So I'm actually leaning toward removing my personal github from my resume this time around, because I have all this experience, and kinda don't want people to glance at my insight project from ~2 years ago and see all this clumsy code (it's not *terrible*, but a lot of that project was just painstaking recoding of messy data, and its certainly not as clean as I'd like.  There's also code for a web-app I built using flask, but I had no idea what I was doing there and am definitely not looking at jobs now that will require anything like that).

705,"I recently completed a timed 3 hour coding challenge with a company.

&amp;#x200B;

The problem was that most of my analysis was shit. I spent maybe a good hour and half familiarizing myself with the data i.e. making distribution charts, doing "".describe()"", etc. I basically wasted a good chunk of my time trying to figure out if I could include more features, remove irrelevant observations ,etc. The dataset itself was also tricky so I was thinking of doing some other loss function i.e. the median was zero when the variable spanned \[0, inf\]. I was thinking of maybe trying out robust regression for this problem.

&amp;#x200B;

Before I started modeling, I then wanted to test if the assumptions were valid to employ regression.  All of this was in one big ass lazy notebook.

In the middle of all of this, I noticed I only had like 20 min. left and I didn't write anything down. I tried to clean up my notebook and made some random comments here and there.

I've got almost 21 different attributes/possible predictors for the revenue for each type of transaction that was done. These include things like the type of service that was used for the transaction, the client, the start date and end date for each transaction, a minimum and maximum estimate of how many hours the person who was involved in doing the work for the transaction, the actual amount of hours it took, and many others. 

&amp;#x200B;

Basically, I want to be able to feed these predictors into the model as that data comes in, which will show that predicted revenue for the end of the month. Any ideas?",1
720,"Hello data friends! I just wanna check in and share my journey over the last few years. It's atypical, and maybe the outcome would not be ideal for some of you but I think it's just dandy for me.

I graduated in 2014 with a double major in theoretical mathematics and behavioral science. Note, that this left me with no applied math like stats, and deep understanding of calculus and a little topology. I struggled to break into the tech world, and wound up doing a lot of random jobs, from retail to manual labor. 


I discovered data science and machine learning through Andrew Ng's coursera in 2016. I did the Galvanize DSi in early 2017, after about six months of self-study. During the job search, I continued working in a labor field I really enjoy (not going into it here, but it involves music, climbing on steel beams 100+ ft in the air, and a lot of rope). I ended up finding some contracts that supplemented that income well, and enjoyed the variety for a bit over a year. One of those contracts required me to learn Golang for ETL work. The same contract had a few opportunities for interesting mini-projects, but nothing really deep or involving machine learning.


At the end of 2018, I asked my boss at that company what the possibilities were for me in 2019, and he was honest. It'd be more of the same, and he didn't have the time or money to offer me more training to focus on development. So, I resumed my job search.

Since then, I did 51 applications. Four responses, three phone interviews, and then something strange happened. I had gotten to the in-person interview at a major organization, and the Golang experience on my resume caught their attention. I was forwarded to an engineering division, did a phone interview, code interview, then finally flew out this week for in-person interviews. No immediate offer, but I was told to ""start packing"" by their director of engineering as I left the building. 

My title and pay will be as a mid-level engineer, but they're hoping I can act as their liaison between engineering and data science and I am BEYOND stoked for the challenge. As I said above, I imagine the more academic folks here wouldn't be satisfied with this outcome, but I couldn't be happier. I'll be moving to an area of the country I love, working on a huge variety of tasks, with opportunities to learn and go back to school. 


It was a long, frustrating road to get here. 100% worth it. I was described as ""a wild stallion, ready to come to pasture and be broken"" in the interview. Uncomfortable description, honestly, but entirely accurate. I've blazed my own trail, and it was scary and uncertain at times, but it's turned out well. 


Here's to all you weirdos! Keep trying! You can do it!",1

722," Hi,

The idea behind *Black Swans Meetups* is that: if data-scientists meet with new data-scientists, they will discover wildly different (often better) approaches, models, etc., which can be applied to whatever they are working on.

Paul Erdős, the most prolific mathematician ever to have lived, recognised this. He was always travelling around, staying with different mathematicians who gave him new ideas to prove new theorems. His motto was “another roof, another proof”.

I imagine each meetup would be held in some capital city, and data-scientists could go to share ideas, give cool presentations about what they’re working on, etc.

Please comment below your thoughts. To learn more, go to: [www.blackswans.io/post/143](https://www.blackswans.io/post/143).

723,"Hello all,

(Note: haven’t taken calc or linear algebra-planning on learning that later-want to get some data analyst projects under my belt while I learn more advanced stuff

So right now I’m going through OpenIntro to Stats to brush up on my Stats knowledge. I’m just curious if there is any book at there, in Python, that goes over the tools for Python in data analysis. Also is there a book that goes through projects and tutorials just to get a hands on approach to implementing what I’m learning?

(Mocs, books, papers, etc all welcomes but books preferred)

Thanks Y’all!",1

727,"Might be a dumb question... or not appropriate for this sub. But I was thinking deeply about this problem recently.

Is extrapolation ever a big concern for anyone here?

2 cases,

1) Due to realistic constraints, training data might not cover enough numerical range. So you might be extrapolating on some out-of-sample data.  

2) Even if you have a big training data, what if it's not covering a realistic numerical range for OOS data that is rare but can happen?",1

730,"Hi-- I have a basic understanding of how to use Python to create a random forests model. I have some data that has a person's age, gender, location, and so forth (I do not have smoking status in my data), and I would like to be able to predict whether or not each person in a smoker. However, I don't have a dataset to train a model on. I am trying data.gov and most of what I see is already aggregated. Anyone know of another way to find data for this?

Thanks!",1
731,"I recently decided to pivot from a more BI career to a Data Scientist/Analyst career, in order to grow into a more senior role, responsible for data strategy and the like. To this end I decided to go back to school, get my pre-reqs and start a Masters in Statistics. 

However, even entry-level Calculus and Linear Algebra punished me and I had to basically give up, having learned that this was something I definitely did not have in me. I do feel that I'm intelligent, just not in the same way as someone who's very comfortable in Mathematics. Of course the Masters in Statistics is out of the question. 

Which of course bring me to my future career. Is there a place for someone who doesn't ""get"" Math easily? If so, how?

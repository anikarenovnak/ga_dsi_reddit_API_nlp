0,"Welcome to /r/depression's check-in post - a place to take a moment and share what is going on and how you are doing. If you have an accomplishment you want to talk about (these shouldn't be standalone posts in the sub as they violate the ""role model"" rule, but are welcome here), or are having a tough time but prefer not to make your own post, this is a place you can share.

We try our best to keep this space as safe and supportive as possible on reddit's wide-open anonymity-friendly platform. The community rules can be found in the sidebar, or under ""Community Info"" in the official mobile apps. If you aren't sure about a rule, [please ask us](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Fdepression). 

*****

Sorry about letting the last post get archived.  We've been super-busy keeping up with the modqueue and that's slowing down our work on making the community rules more clear and visible and migrated to the standard reddit rules system - we *are* spending all the available time we have on that.  In the meantime, if you're on mobile, please read the info and rules which are under ""Community Info"" on the menu when you're visiting the subreddit.  

I'd like to highlight the most common violations that create extra work for us.  Please use reddit's ""report"" function when you see anything like that.  The exact reasons are less important than the existence of a report, because that puts it in our modqueue where we will look at it first chance we get.  

*  Helpers inviting private contact as a first resort.  Nobody who's both well-meaning and knowledgeable should ever do this.  Please keep your conversations out in the public threads unless/until you've established a solid rapport, and preferably let the OP decide when it's time to go private.   

* ""I'm here to help"" posts.  These are specifically against the rules.  

* Posts that aren't directly relevant to personal experience of depression, the mental illness and/or aren't requests for support.  Everything we do here is based on our core belief that talking about depression is both important and difficult, so we need to be strict about keeping on-topic.  You don't need to have a clinical diagnosis of depression to post here, but, on the other hand, being diagnosed doesn't mean it's okay for you to talk about anything.  For example, depression is *not* loneliness, it's not low self-esteem, and it's not being sad or distressed for good reasons.  Those are all important and serious issues too, and they should be discussed, but this is not the place.  

**Edit:**  I wrote this in a comment reply below but I want to highlight it here:  We enforce the rules as leniently as possible in the case of people who have come here to get support, but strictly in the case of people who are here for any other reason. We think it makes sense to ask people who are giving help to police themselves, but we try to cut people in need of help as much slack as we can without allowing discussions that take focus away from others in need of support. 

If you have concerns or questions about community business or moderation, please talk to us [in modmail](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Fdepression) before you make a post about it.  

Thanks to everyone for their courage in sharing their struggles, and their kindness in supporting others.  ",0

A girl i used to watch and lurk in here chat room was on after a few years of me not seeing her. Something told me to stop in one last time. It ended up being one of the best decision i have ever made. Somehow we struck up a conversation out of thin air. The conversation continued the next night. And the next. Surprisingly i had forgotten all about my plans. I ACTUALLY started looking forward to the next day and our next conversation. Fast forward a few weeks and I'm still here. Still talking to her almost daily. I don't know if it will last, but for today I'm still here and for that i will always be grateful to the unlikeliest person in the world a CAM GIRL!!!!




Edit: This is my first post on Reddit I did not expect such a response.    I felt I should clarify some of this. Yes she is a cam girl and that is how we meet. But over the weeks it has transitioned into a friendship I didn't expect. No I'm not expecting a relationship or really anything from her. It's just she has been through some dark days herself so we can just talk to each other when we want/need to about the things people without mental illness just don't understand or whatever we feel like talking about. The point of the post was that I found a genuine friend in the last place I would expect. And maybe if I can find some one like that in the weirdest way possible all hope isn't lost yet. ",0
5,"(I'm sorry in advance if this comes off as entitled and spoiled, I am quite spoiled. One of the reasons why I don't understand anything. I do not deserve this life.)

my birthday is in less than a week and my parents and friends have been asking for the past weeks what I'm planning and I just say nothing. Because I don't want to celebrate it. It makes me so fucking sad that I'll already be 20 and I'm still not dead yet nor achieved anything at all, I never will. 

Nevertheless, my friends and especially my parents don't understand that I just want to stay home and I don't need/want any gifts.  I just want to be left alone. I don't see what I add to social events anyway, and I don't understand why people don't even try to understand that.

Does anyone have any good tips on explaining this desire to stay home and take it easy, or excuses to not have to go places? I'd like to quickly settle it with everyone in a respectful manner, I don't want them to get mad or irritated since I'll be scared I will be so as well.",0
6,"I saw a post on here earlier today that was talking about how depression has taken their personality away from them. This really struck a chord with me, as I often feel dull and disconnected from myself and everyone else. But I’ve been thinking about it and, unlike what most people seem to say about losing a part of themselves, I can’t remember a time when I was ever “whole.” I don’t know who I was before this. I’m not even sure there was a before. Maybe it’s just me. Maybe I’ve never been normal, and maybe I never can be. Maybe there’s nothing for me to look forward to. Maybe there’s no way out. It might always control me because maybe it is just *me*.

I really associate everyone and everything in my life with negativity. I feel like I just need to cut everyone off and start over. I have resources and a fairly wealthy family so I have options, I could go to a smaller school. These experience has matured me really fast and I feel like I can't vibe with kids my own age anymore. I used to be pretty outgoing but I'm really quiet and insecure now and it sucks.

13,"Ever since I was younger (like 11-12) I’ve been depressed. It didn’t get really bad until I was 14-15. But up until that point I tried to.. I guess put on a happy face and act like nothing was wrong. So once it became bad it came kind of like a shock to everyone (my family and certain friends) because I’m “so happy and cheerful” all the time. It all went downhill from there though. I was basically being denied that I had depression, it got even worse, and with that I got extreme anxiety too. I was barely going to school when I was in high school because I was so anxious/depressed and have so many panic attacks so I would just walk away the second I got there. (I’m 21 now) It was really bad. But on the multiple times I’ve told my family about it they didn’t understand it. I thought okay fair.. cultural difference; they’re not from here and mental health IS only starting to get de-stigmatized. Obviously I was noticeably skipping school so my teachers were wondering what’s up and I ended up breaking down to my school counsellor that it was hard for me because I was depressed and I was having like 3 panic attacks a day. I knew about this other course kinda thing that was aimed more towards kids like me.. it was the same courses but not as overwhelming? I hate that I sound so sensitive. Anyway basically I was denied it all until I got to my last year of high school and they realized that I actually might not graduate. Tbh I was suicidal so I didn’t really care how well I did or not.

But here’s the thing. Like I said before, I’ve told my family multiple times. They didn’t understand it. But I have a cousin who is also depressed and they always talk about her depression and how we should help her out more etc.. when she comes over it’s all about making sure she’s okay and has a good time.. and I’m not JEALOUS of her I’m just confused because my parents act like me having depression is impossible even though my cousin is essentially the same. As for high school, I had another friend who was also depressed &amp; anxious but wasn’t denied anything at all... yet when it came to me it was like yeah right.

I always get guilt tripped too. It’s always like oh YOU feel bad? Well imagine how xxx feels. Or that someone has it worse than me. Stuff like that. It’s really changed how I talk about myself tbh. I know that people have it worse than me. So why should I feel the way that I do? I think like this to myself all the time but it makes me feel worse tbh.

I think people have an image of me that I’m happy and cheerful 24/7 and I want to be but I’m not and it fucking sucks because I did so bad in high school because I was so depressed and tried to reach out to family and school to help me but they didn’t until the last minute. Even now I don’t talk to my family about depression. I’ve only started to take and try medication once I turned 18 because they would let me.

Lately shit has been harder than usual again. I feel like I’m falling down the same pit I did in high school and it’s endless. I just hate myself so much. I really wish I could talk about it but everyone has this vision of me that they can’t seem to get out of their heads so me having depression and anxiety is impossible to them. I don’t even want attention I just want support. I’m going to be try and get past this on my own as usual. But this really fucking sucks.",0
14,"My depression impacts my relationships the most. I lost so many friends because I confided my thoughts and feelings to them, and now I just feel like I did it all wrong. I have friends here and there, but no interest in catching up because I have nothing “positive” to say. 

I feel like I’ve lost everyone, and wish I could go back and save all the bridges I burnt. There were so many things I could have done differently. 

I’m stuck into thinking about the past and all I lost and it’s like I can’t move on. I want new relationships and friends, but in my current state it’s impossible to get close to anyone. 

On the plus side, I got really good at pretending I’m fine at work, so I’ve at least have had some success.

Ever since my depression started at the age of 10, I’ve been convinced that my cause of death will be suicide. It sounds horrible, but I’ve just accepted that fact. It’s not going to happen anytime soon, but I know that it’ll probably happen. I’ve never seen myself with a future. And this isn’t asking for advice, just seeing if anyone has the same mindset?

idk, i feel like everybody fucking hates me. whenever i make new friends and we get close, they end up fucking abandoning me for no reason. i mean i'm not one to stop them from talking to me, but could they at least give me closure? this happens a lot. it makes me feel like i have some sort of problem. it makes me hate myself.
and my old childhood friends who have been with me for years will never abandon me but damn, they aren't very comfortable around me either, in that they don't share stuff with me and they don't even include me in their plans and i end up being ignored most of the time with them.
 a lot of the times people have blatantly called me ""annoying"" when i opened up and socialised, but i only did what they asked me to do - TO OPEN UP AND SOCIALISE. i mean they hate it when im quiet and shy but when i socialise they have a problem again. like make your fucking mind up. 

i don't know, i feel miserable. i don't know why people do this shit. and i know that if someone happens to come across this the only comments will be ""you know, try therapy"" or ""talk to someone"" (doesn't help btw) or ""oh sweetie you must have some problem you mustn't be aware of and that's why people leave you"" like bitch ... i've literally asked them what the fucking problem is and they don't wanna tell me. and i can't find a problem with myself either but hey guess what, i guess a random stranger on the internet must be correct ?
anyway if you read this and sympathised thank you. please don't comment shit on here. i'm already in a pretty shitty place as it is and i don't need any more crap.

20,"I know that for some people they got depressed/mentally ill at a certain age, but they were able to live a good or okay life for the most part up until then. 
I have never had that though. That “normal” life most healthy individuals get to have.
By that I mean that they grow up having normal experiences like having friends in school, hanging out with them outside of school, joining clubs, being social, having those cliché middle and high school relationships, learning how to drive at 16, etc. 

I, for the most part, have not experienced these things. Growing up I was extremely shy and did not know how to socialize and this really held me back in making friends. I developed social anxiety when I got to middle school and this made me avoid socializing even more which made me continue to get outcasted and an easy target for bullying.
Up until high school, I had never had any genuine friends. The “friends” I had before high school were people who pitied me enough to talk to me and they would mostly leave me out of the group conversations and never asked me to hang out with them after school. 

For some reason things changed when I went to high school. I guess it was a mixture of puberty, a small surge of confidence, and a strong yearning for change in my life. I did not want to repeat elementary and middle school again, so I did everything I could to prevent that. The summer before high school I spent my time researching social skills and looking at YouTube videos of people my age to see what was “cool” and what wasn’t. I pretty much just studied people like a mad scientist until I was able to pass off as “normal”. I also did some changes to my appearance and started dressing better. 
Long story short, I went to high school for only one year until my trauma from getting bullied everyday in middle school caught up to me. But let me say that this one year of high school was one of the greatest times of my life. That was the only time in my life so far that I have felt like a normal person and I strongly desire to feel this again. 

I dropped out of high school due to my mental health and I lost all friends and haven’t had a life since. Lately I’ve been thinking about how isolated and sheltered my life has been, if you can even call this a life. I’m wondering if other people have had a shitty lonely life like me. 

It’s really sad that the highlight of my life so far has been to feel like a normal person and have friends. Majority of people have this all the time and they don’t even appreciate it.",0

23,"Going to take some time to accept it but that's the way it is. As kissless virgin 18 year old female, I have absolutely never felt attracted to at all, nor received any male attention in my life, except a few catcalls from drunk men and being groped on my way to school at 6 in the morning, which was just scary, if anything. I'm not attractive, my face is too broad and fat, my features too coarse to be considered feminine. I'm pretty overweight, I'm working on getting in shape but as my depression and self hatred keep getting worse I feel like it's not even worth trying anymore. I'll never look the way I want to look. No matter how much time and money and energy I spend on losing weight and getting plastic surgery, it will never be satisfying enough. I'm sick of the ""body positivity"" movement going around telling everyone that they're beautiful when nothing could be farther from the truth. Some people are attractive, others are not. I'm not saying ugly people don't deserve to be happy, but I find people who like to believe that beauty standards don't exist delusional. We tend to find certain feaures more aesthetically pleasing, and that's just a natural aspect of physical attraction if anything.

As somebody who is a 2/10 at best, it was absolutely heartbreaking to realise that I have nothing to offer to someone, sexually or romantically, because I'm as ugly on the inside as I am on the outside. I go around acting like I don't care about my appearance and keep telling friends that I couldn't care less about not having had any intimate relationships, the truth is that I achingly need to feel desired. But at the same time, if someone were to show any kind of interest in me whatsoever, I'd immediately think what kind of a pathetic and desperate loser they have to be in order to be attracted to somebody as unappealing, ugly, selfish, cynical and borderline disgusting as me. I just want to be able to completely shut off my sexual/emotional side and continue my life alone and without the need to feel wanted, because it seems like the easiest way out for me.",0

Most of my friends (who I’m thankful for and they’re great) have jobs they all love, come from loving and well off families, etc. and can’t really relate to what I’m experiencing.

25,"Pun semi-intended.

I’m a 21yo male in my senior year of college, and I literally cannot remember a time where I wasn’t completely devoid of energy. I slog though the day, but every time I have to try to hold a conversation I can feel it draining what little mental capacity I have left. Idk if my depression medication helps that much; all I know is that it levels me out so I feel consistent, but consistent in his case means consistently tired and emotionless. I guess that’s better than extremely sad.

I’ve been diagnosed with ADD as well, so I have a prescription for adderall. When I take the adderall, I feel like my old self again — the kid who used to enjoy taking on DIY projects and hanging out with friends, who had capacity for intelligent thought and problem solving, who had a certain degree of creativity and a good deal of motivation. I feel awake and alive, and I can thrive socially. I can feel optimistic. I know it’s an amphetamine, hence the energy boost, but it feels like the only way to get to “normal”. 

I just don’t know how to keep shuffling through like a zombie anymore. I don’t like to have to depend on drugs, when everyone else is already full of energy without the same crutch. I exercise every day, I eat healthy, I get enough sleep, but I still feel drained. Like a plant that hasn’t been watered. I feel like the personification of a glass of flat soda.

When I was around that age, school could be stressful to me because my family always expected me to get perfect grades.

No higher deity would allow this, this much pain, this much negativity in his creation.

I’ve had a severe case of bullying for my looks in the past and I’ve been rejected mainly for my looks. When someone compliments me it’s always “you have a nice personality”, I’ve never heard anyone compliment me on my looks apart from out of pity.

49,"Hello. Throwaway account. I've been debating posting this or not but I don't care at this point... I'm feeling overwhelmingly sad and needed to share with someone what's gnawing at me inside.

About a year ago, I began noticing signs that something was wrong with me. It was after a devastating break up with my very first boyfriend (we were college sweethearts and he was literally my first everything). We've never had an easy relationship and I spiraled after breaking up-- I just never felt the same. About two months after breaking up, we get back together after I begged him-- I know this isn't exactly healthy either.

Now, I'm turning 24 and just completed a two-week intensive mental health therapy session. I have no family history of mental illness so this was all extremely new to me. I was diagnosed with Borderline Personality Disorder and this freaked me out. I have the kind of family that is happy, go-lucky all the time and I haven't told them yet. I live on the West coast while they are on the East. I live with my bf and we've been together 5 years now. He's been supportive of me getting help but he's also seemingly emotional unavailable. I struggle with this. He is the type of person who seems to never be bothered and his go-to motto is to ""move on""; no use crying over spilled milk, as he puts it. I'm so desperate for an understanding person.  Since I completed my two week sessions, I thought I was getting better but have already had two noticeable arguments/fights with my bf where I feel like I'm still crazy and not right in the head.

It's so hard to try to get him to understand me. He thinks I'm being overly emotional and often questions, ""Why I can't just let things go"". I have a history of repressing my feelings, sadness, tears, emotions because of this; it stems back to my childhood. When I feel myself spiraling or getting obsessive over a seemingly non-important issue, I tell myself, ""Why can't I just be like him and let things go?"" He makes me feel like a crazy person. I know I'm not crazy. My brain is just wired differently and I express myself differently. I just needed to rant and ask for someone to listen. I'm at work today after a terrible night where a situation occurred and I feel like crap. But, to whoever is reading, thank you for your time. I really hope your day is going better than mine!

I honestly just don’t care about anything for some reason. I am more vocal to people and can’t keep my words inside.

56,"At this point, I feel pretty much disgusted with myself and how I have been acting/treating other people. I think I am a pretty good guy but since this overwhelming feeling of depression and social anxiety has taken hold, I am really down and thinking that I am basically the worst human to walk the planet. I have been told I'm shallow, I'm weird, and I walk into a room and the conversation dies. 

All I want to do is be lively and talkative but my mind is just so in my own head that no matter how hard I try, I am barely present and it is nearly impossible to pay attention yet alone engage in conversation. My memory is toast and I have a constant feeling of head pressure likely due to the anxiety of always feeling like I need to change myself. 

Anyway, has anyone else felt this way and how did you overcome it? Is it possible to recite a mantra telling yourself that you are great 1000 times a day until you actually believe it? I'm just so sick of feeling down about myself 24/7 because I really am a cool guy that people want to be around when I'm not in my own head. ",0

59,"My actual personality is over the top, fun(in my opinion), confident, and kind. But the depression teams up with social anxiety so that I just don't have enough enough energy to act like who I truly am. I turn into this very flat, monotone, boring, quiet person who I would never want to hang out with or date.

It's the main reason I avoid social interaction now - it feels humiliating because I feel like I'm perceived as this pathetic, pitiable, ignorable person.

 When I'm feeling better and have a little more energy I can act like myself but usually I'm just this shell. It's horrible, like watching the progression of ALS in a loved one; they just slowly fade away until there's nothing left of who they used to be. At least with physical illness or bipolar or whatever you have yourself, that fundamental spark of who you truly are, and you're able to show that and share that with others. I don't even have that privilege. 

Sorry if this comes off as arrogant or insensitive, this is just how I feel.

edit: Guys, thanks so much for all the responses. I appreciate all of you. I didn't know so many people felt the same way, and I'm glad if I was able to help give voice to your struggles. I've had depression my whole life so I've had a lot of time to think about these things. I think it helps to be able to really narrow down what you're feeling.

60,"TW: self- harm

Backstory: 
I was diagnosed with severe depression and anxiety at age 15 during my first stay at a psych hospital,but never got on medication because my parents don't believe in depression, anxiety or medicating kids.

Now I am a junior in college and almost in 3rd semester of nursing school. Nothing has changed. In fact everythings just gotten worse. I have 2-4 panic attacks a week, have started shutting down/ disassociating more and more, and have started cutting again after being clean for a year and a half. 

Since I'm now 21 I could go to the doctor to get put on medication, but I'm scared of the possible side effects and how it could affect me during school. I'm also terrified that if the school finds out that they will kick me out of the program. 

Thanks for taking the time to read. I would greatly appreciate any advice or knowledge that anyone has regarding any of this. ",0

No one ever cares

No one ever really wants me around

67,"I have a good job and good career.  I make pretty good money and don’t hate what I do, but I don’t have any passion for it and more and more and more I just find myself sitting at my desk at work staring at a screen doing nothing.  

Lately I’ve started writing at work instead of pretending to work on my actual work.  I’m an indie author and I actually do have passion for it unlike my real career and job but I’m relatively new to the game and make probably around $1000 a month from my one published book so far. Hardly enough to live off of where I live.  

I’ve got terrible anxiety that my company will realize how useless I am at work and fire me and honestly I am pretty useless. I collect a paycheck and hardly do anything to help the company.  Worse I honestly don’t care.  I really could care less about helping make some investors that own the company more money.  I’m so fucking selfish I know, but my only motivators for work are money and fear.  

 I shared this with my spouse the other day and she was supportive of course.  Obviously she worries about our bills (mortgage, student loans, and car payments you know the usual) and whatnot if I do get fired or go full time as an indie author making a whopping $12k a year.  She thinks I need to move to a different company but honestly it’s been this way at the last 3 places I’ve worked over the last 6 or so years. I’ve just gotten worse at tricking myself into caring.  

I wish I was more like her. She has a freaking amazing work ethic, type A personality and all that.  She does a great job where she works and probably never worries she’ll be discovered as a fraud.  

My work ethic sucks, unless it’s something I can get passionate about and I’ve struggled motivating myself my whole life.  People say you learn work ethic growing up but I had a workaholic father and worked jobs all through high school and college and I still never got one.  I think something is wrong with me.  

Anyways I’m trying not (and failing) to wallow in this all consuming depression right now.  I know how much better I’ve got it than most and I’m so selfish I can’t even be happy about that.

I don’t know really what I’m saying. It just makes me mad to see people so awestruck when a seemingly positive and happy kid has depression or ends their life.

I haven’t read the whole thing, just the bits my counselor read to me when we were going through a basic list of symptoms. But also I read other subs here and people describe symptoms and whatnot that I don’t experience at all.

I’ve also attended 3 different colleges already... The only reason I’m still doing this is bc my mom constantly emphasizes how i won’t be able to get a good job without a bachelors degree. I do however have an associates degree but it’s pretty useless.

Every major I’ve tried to pursue has either led to me switching because I can’t handle the workload or bc I don’t find the major practical for life after graduation. Hell, sometimes I’m too damn stupid to comprehend the material and it intimidates me so I look for other options. 

I’ve been in college for almost five years now. (my high school offered a concurrent enrollment program). I don’t know what to do anymore. I can’t find a major I can be passionate about. I’ve talked to guidance counselors about this but I never get any straight forward answers. I feel like an idiot who can’t pick a path and stick to it.

I like the college town life but I hate school. All I do is show up to classes, try not to zone out during lectures, mindlessly write notes and then slave away behind my pc in attempt at writing mediocre C- papers I couldn’t care less about. I’m only motivated by the fear of failure and the financial consequences of it. I get sick just thinking about how heavy the weight of my academic responsibilities are.

God I hate the way that drug makes me feel but I can’t operate without it. 

I’m absolutely miserable in school. I feel so lost. The guilt of my selfishness rips me to shreds. My parents are far from rich and honestly I don’t even know how they can afford to pay for my tuition. In the end all I want to do is to be able to afford to live comfortably on my own and be happy. I’m scared and I’m tired.  I just want to be free. I just don’t have the drive or passion of the students I see around me. Something awful is going to happen, and it’s all going to be my fault. 

I have a history of running away from my problems. Quitting both the wrestling and track team mid season senior year in high school, moving out at midnight from my ex’s apartment and spontaneously quitting a good job I had lined up after learning she fell out of love with me,(that whole thing fucked me up real good.) and the numerous cases of me looking for escapes from college classes bc I can’t handle the stress. I can’t keep living like this. I wish I could just die or runaway but I’m in too deep.

So I been at a kindergarten a few times. And today their boss visited and talked with the people that work here. Then she called me in and asked me to work Monday-Friday. I got super happy and said yes. But now an hour later I’m realising it’s not for long. “Till summer” is only like 3 months. Then I’m nowhere again beside something more to write on my CV.

Honestly tho as I’m writing this, I’m realising that I feel like I’m not ready for all the responsibilities of a full time job. I don’t even hate being a “jump in” I get to see many kindergarten’s. The only issue tho with only jump around is one month i might work a lot. But the next month I work like nothing. And I wanna earn enough money so I can move from home.

I know my mindset is wrong thinking like this. Like yo, u just got a job till summer at ur favourite kindergarten. + it’s a great way to practice on ur social anxiety. The fact that the boss called you in is a big deal. Even tho it’s only till summer it’s a great working experience and might lead to bigger things.

But yea...

TLDR: got a full time job till summer. But I’m realising it’s only till summer then I’m back at the start having a fragile working schedule. It’s better than nothing tho.",0

I want to feel good and it's really frustrating that I can't control that. All I do now is smoke cigarettes. I smoke a lot bc it makes me feel good. I am thinking about smoking weed again.

started nursing school a month back, but I realized that this just isn't for me.

104,"I spent a large chunk of time from age 17 to late 19 doing absolutely nothing because of my depression. Nothing might be an exaggeration but I definitely missed out on a lot of things due to this illness. I've spent months at a time just sat indoors reading reddit and watching dumb videos to numb my sadness. 

I had quite a wild youth in many ways and I can't say that I didn't have a lot of fun at times but that seems unimportant in the face of so many lost days, weeks and months. I also was so camera shy and insecure that most pictures from my teenage years are selfies and for large periods of time, there are no pictures of me at all. The regret I feel for not overcoming my camera shyness sooner is also haunting me. My friends all have tons of pictures of them with other friends and I have so few. I can't stop thinking about this, it's almost become an obsession. 

 In the run up to 20, I promised myself I would change things and I have. I've made huge progress but I feel like its all irrelevant and pointless because I will never be a teenager again and I will never be able to relive my wasted youth. It's killing me inside and I think about committing suicide just to make these thoughts stop. It's like my brain is torturing me by constantly reminding me of the things I missed out on. 

I'm trying so fucking hard to move forward but I am consumed by this regret. Suicide seems like the only way to make this stop. I feel like I wasted some of the best years in a humans life and knowing there is nothing I can do to change this is unbearable. I feel so fucking sad and nobody seems to understand the pain I'm in.

Sorry for the big chunk of text but I just needed to get this off my chest. ",0
105,"Disclaimer: I've only been diagnosed with depression, everything else I mention in this post is just how I feel.

Tl;dr abandonment issues, strange persistent feeling of loss or that something bad happened, even though I haven't gone through something like that

So, this is awkward to say, but I feel like I had a great loss, or something idk that was left unresolved. I get this eerie feeling of loss for some years now, it's either random, or triggered by something that deals with the subject, like some musics. The thing is, I don't recall experiencing a loss like that, and I don't have a clear explanation to that. I have some remarkable events and factors that might explain it, or at least explain other things*

- I had a babysitter that was basically my caretaker up until 7 yo, since my parents were out all the day working or studying, and after that she left and I didn't get to see her for a long time, and  when I got, it was for a very short time

- I left my hometown, where my relatives lived, when I was 10, and moved to a city that didn't have any relatives or friends

- After I moved the only meaningful friendship I stablished was abusive. I could go on and give more details if it is needed, but basically it made my self esteem go down a lot, and the friend in question isolated me, so I didn't have anyone else

- I feel that I have abandonment issues* ( don't know if is a consequence of the previous things, or if it has to do with the loss feeling), I get jealous of my friends, sometimes I try and distance myself emotionally from them, because I feel like they'll leave me, or ditch me for someone else, for say, a boyfriend, or that they don't really like me that much Edit: Forgot to said that I'm emotionally  immature with them, I get mad or sad or both over really small and stupid reasons, which prompts me to ignore them and be salty, until I realize that I'm being dumb and stupid. I'm very emotionally closed too, I don't tell people my feeling and just let them pile up until I explode (which takes months)

- Im transgender (MTF)... Don't know if has something to do with it... It's here in case it does

So that's the stuff I feel like could be significant to that feeling, but, like I said, I'm not sure if it explains away my feeling, could it be that I have gone through other thing that I don't remember, either by being too young or just blocked out, that made me feel that way ? People how have experience with the subject, please tell me your experiences and what you think",0
106,"Sorry for the rant. This post isn't intended to find answers, I just want to vent.

I have so far been very lucky in life. I am young, fit, have a good career and have a loving, beautiful partner. Our life looks very picture perfect on the surface and I do at times experience genuine joy.

But I have also come to discover that I experience periods of depression. It is something that I have been aware of for the past several years, but it started out as pretty insignificant. I only recently realized that my depression had gone from rare, short occurrences to a majority of the time where I feel like life has no purpose (although I thankfully have no thoughts of self harm or suicide).

I have made major efforts to ""fix"" my depression. I quit drinking, I started exercising regularly, I took up more hobbies, etc. I live a very productive life that nobody would associate with a depressed person and yet here I am. I have done everything I could to make a fulfilling life for myself, but my depression still loomed.

So I realized that maybe my brain is a little broken. I'm okay with that. I decided to talk to my doctor about it. This was difficult for me. I was raised in an Irish Catholic home and find it very difficult to talk about my emotions, despite being a very sensitive person. I typically get overwhelmed and begin to sob to the point where I can't speak until it passes. Only my sister and partner have witnessed me like this.

So I made an appointment to see my family doctor. I didn't feel comfortable telling the receptionist that the appointment was for my depression, so I said that I wanted to check up on some minor issues I had been having.

In the appointment, we went over the minor issue and came up with a solution for that. He then asked me if I had any other health concerns. Every part of me wanted to say ""Nope, all good Doc! Thanks a bunch!"", but I managed to bring up that I had been dealing with depression and wanted to discuss treatment.

I forget exactly what he said because it really shocked me, but it was along the lines of ""I don't have the time to address this right now and it's probably just a seasonal thing"". He told me to make an appointment in a few months if I still feel the same way.

Like I said I'm not looking for answers or anything. I'm sure there are plenty of people that claim to be suffering from depression for different reasons, but it took a lot for me to even bring it up and then just like that, I was dismissed. I realize that I've been living with this for years and a couple more months won't make a big difference, but it made me feel so worthless and small. Just another event in life that has made me feel like I should keep my emotions to myself.

If you made it this far, thanks for reading. I'm in this for the long haul, so I will get the treatment I need, but I just wanted to get this off my chest. I hope you have an excellent day!",0
107,"i know this isn’t really about me, but i have to say it somewhere. i love him so much. god, i really do love him. he is so depressed, much more than i am. he’ll tell me that he doesn’t want to be alive, quite so often but not like all the time. but tonight he said he actually wanted to kill himself. he texted me that he was suicidal. i don’t know what to do. i told him that i was there for him, and that i’ll support him through everything. and i really do mean it. i’m so scared. i even texted his mom about what was going on because i wasn’t able to be there physically to help him. i’m very glad that i did that, but i don’t think it helped all that much. i’m scared every night that i’ll wake up in the morning to find the terrible news that he’s gone forever. it makes me nauseous to think about him gone. i can’t talk about it without bursting down crying. i’m so scared. i’m so so scared. when i go to school in the morning all i’m thinking about is him, until i see him in the hallways. how do i help him. please, he doesn’t deserve to feel so shitty all of the time. i’m so scared that one day when he says he’s going to kill himself, he’ll actually do it.",0
108,"I didn't get to see my usual Dr. today when I went to renew my prescription. I am only on 50mg of sertraline (zoloft), and from my understanding it is pretty mild and I'm not having side effects. But he was talking about coming off of it and he only gave me 6 months rather than the 12 I usually get.

This is is really irritating to me because in my city there is a shortage of Dr.s so the walk in clinic is the only option for most, and you have to go there early to line up outside an hour or more before the place even opens to get an appointment. It's a huge pain in the ass. So now I will have to do this all over again in six months.

But what is the reason for even wanting me to go off? This drug is life changing for me and stopping is not really an option. I suffered for 10+ years before I got help and there is no way I am going back to that.",0

I’ve never had a girlfriend and I never will becuz of how ugly and unbearably annoying I am and I don’t deserve one anyway. I don’t deserve to be happy and I don’t deserve to live I just wanna die and I pray that I either die or gain the strength to kill my self because I shouldn’t live.

111,"Is anyone else hyper-aware of the fact that they can’t deal with things the way people without mental illnesses can? Yes, I know that I feel things much too strongly, and every single stressor seems to turn into a life-or-death situation for me. Every day I become more aware of the fact that I simply cannot function the way a normal person can. Everything is much harder for me to deal with, and even getting out of bed is a constant struggle (as cliché as that is). I overthink so much that I hurt my own feelings, and it feels like I’m constantly running from myself, even though I know I can never escape. So, yes, I know I got 8 hours of sleep, but I’m so exhausted from this fight. 

Does this inability to function/deal with emotions/etc as well as “normal” people ever get to anyone else? Like, I can cope as much as possible, and do everything right, take all the medicines, but I will always be sick. And it’s exhausting.",0

114,"So recently against my better judgement my ex girlfriend came back to me and told me that she missed me and she wanted to be back in my life and I was extremely happy because up until we broke up I had raised her child from birth. It was the happiest day of my life and it was the happiest 2 years of my entire life... then out of nowhere she began cheating and then abandon me and our home and went to the other side of the nation. I was partially to blame for my alcoholic Tendencies but towards the end it was pure chaos and I was looking for an escape anyway I could.

My life completely ended so to speak for that chapter I picked up my roots and I moved back closer to family to pick myself back up. 

I rebuilt my life got myself into a new career making much more money I got all of my bills paid down and wiped out my debt. And then she decided she wanted to come back into my life.

She talked to smooth game talked about moving in with me letting me back into the only child I've ever known as my son's life. I thought I had done it all of my wildest dreams had come true. Maybe in the fool that I am she said that I would need a bigger living space if she were to move down here and I went out of the way and let her select what area of the city we would be in despite cheaper alternatives to my bachelor lifestyle. I rented the house got preparations in order started decorating my son's new room. I was in pure ecstasy.

My ex-girlfriend currently lives with my best friend and it's a complicated situation but basically I have found out that since the beginning of our little 2 months long-distance relationship she has been seeing some other guy and has been making preparations to move in with him. 

I'm absolutely floored. I feel played and cheated I feel like absolute garbage. My long list of life accomplishments now means nothing as my self-confidence has never been lower. I don't understand how somebody can look you in the face tell you how much they miss you and that they love you and then be so vile. The last three years of my life have revolved around this woman and they seem like they are all for nothing. 

Better yet this continues to happen on a cycle, my past three serious relationships have all ended the same way and it's starting to give me self-worth issues, I'm a hard worker I've always held down two jobs to the best of my ability and put my first foot forward when it comes to effort on accomplishing my goals, but right now I can't even leave my house. I'm extremely surprised that I'm still sober during all of this because traditionally stress of this magnitude has always landed me in jail due to my drinking.

I don't know why I'm typing all of this out I guess I just want people to listen because right now it seems like my life is falling apart again, and I have to make a tough situation of cutting her out of my life and never getting to have a relationship with that amazing, cute little boy who still calls me daddy. I've never been the kind of person I have Suicidal Tendencies but I have to say in the past 2 weeks I have had this stuff popping into my head more and more.

The night I found out about the whole thing I had to go to work at night and just the thought of her going home to some other guy spending time with my child... I was looking around and it was 11 at night on a not so busy part of the interstate, I was the only car around on my stretch. For a moment I close my eyes and I just put my foot to the pedal, the only thing that really snap me out of it is my car going over the semi-truck strip and I thought about my family missing me and pulled over, spent 20 minutes crying in my car untill a state trooper pulled up behind me to check if I was ok. I just unloaded.

He sat there for about 10 minutes and listened to me babble, I'm a grown ass man and I was sitting there in tears talking to a man in uniform about my fucking relationship issues. He told me things would be okay I just got in his car and told me to get to wherever I was going safely.

Ever since that night nothing seems right I have this rock in the bottom of my stomach that won't move, I can't keep down any food in the morning I throw up at least once, and every night I shake myself to sleep only to wake back up 15 minutes later drenched in a pubble of my own sweat.

Anyways I don't really know what I'm doing here and I don't know what this feeling is I've experienced it before but never to such a level that for the first time in my life, I'm ok with not waking up the next day.",0
115,"Ok, and? That doesn't make it easier. Saying that it will get better in the future (which doesn't always happen to everyone despite the story book ending people want you to believe) ignores the current situation I'm in now. It's like I'm expected to forget the horrible things I feel now. That doesn't make me feel any better. I need help now. I need to cope now. I want to get rid of this pain and loneliness now. It's like going up to a homeless person and saying, ""Don't worry, you'll be rich in the future."" Okay, great, but they're poor *now.* They need that money *now.*

Also I hate the idea that just because I'm younger, people assume I have more of an opportunity to make friends. That make ring true for some, but if you're as socially inept as I am, trying to start a conversation is like rocket science.

I know when people say that I'm still young, they're just trying to help. I'm just tired of the cliche statements getting thrown my way.

A bit about myself first. I finished my master thesis a month ago and am now about to start working on my PhD. Together with my collegues I am participating in a 6-day long conference about our work in physics. There I held a presentation about the results of my master thesis and I completely fucked it up. I have always been super nervouswhen giving presentations and I just can't seem to get better in it.

So, after my talk I went out to get drunk. I got drunk really fast and then had a breakdown in the middle of the city. I started crying, screaming and hitting myself in the face. At first, everybody just stared at me, then some guy came up to me asking if I needed a hug. I took the offer, we talked about an hour or so and then went to his place. He asked me if he could kiss me and I let him do it. Then he asked me if I wanted to have sex with him. I said yes. At first, it was ""normal"" sex but then it got kind of odd. He told me that for this night I would belong solely to him and he started thrusting really hard. He choked me, started slapping my ass and breasts and finally slapped me in the face. The weird thing was, that I liked it and I am scared of that.

All I'm interested in is having it all be over, and it sucks that it has to be that way, but there is no other way. There is nothing for me in life. The only hope I have is for there to be something better on the other side. The only thing I can be sure of in life is increased suffering. There is no joy. Joy is a lie. Joy is not real in my subjective experience. I don't even want to be happy anymore. ",0

Hey. 'Tis me, completely random person. Let me introduce you to my venting post.

I've been feeling pretty shit, to be honest. To put this entire thing into perspective, I'll go to the very start of all of this.

Before mid 2018 I had but *one* friend. I've known him for about four years. It's not the type of friend that I can tell everything to, however, as weird as that may seem. He wants to be friends with everyone, and thus I felt like I was just another one of those friends (I think he considered someone else that has been here for but a few months to be a better friend, even.

In november (maybe even a little earlier), however, he introduced me to his ""friend group"". They were my classmates, but I hadn't spent much time with them at all. I just knew them. They weren't real ""friends"". I knew nothing about them. But that changed, and especially one person stuck out. Our first real encounter was over text, where I gave her some advice on how to deal with a person that's depressed (her friend was (and most likely is, but I'm not sure) depressed). Only after a couple hours did we stop texting.

Later that month, when we came together, I saw her again, and when everyone had left, we stayed to talk a little bit longer. And that was magical. I began to trust her in a matter of seconds. I felt like I could tell her anything from the very beginning.

Later, on normal weekdays even, but also in the weekends, she'd hint at the fact that she wanted to be added to my group call through very adorable text messages. Sometimes my friend didn't want her to join. In that case I'd wait it out till 11pm, whereafter I'd call her. Here as well I felt comfortable, appreciated, loved, and comforted in a matter of seconds. First we stopped at 12am, then at 1:30, then at 2:00, then at 3:00. Time or sleep was of no importance, I just wanted to talk to her.

I recall so many good memories when I think about those calls again. I remember her adorable laugh when I got up out of my chair to put my pillow back on my bed. I'd asked her ""what about it?"" and the only thing she did was say ""nothing"", whereafter she giggled.

I also recall her falling asleep when we were deep into the night. I had waited 15 minutes whispering her name every now and then to check if she was still awake. I could go on and on and on and on...

This all stopped when winter break hit. I went on a short vacation for a week. The parties had stopped. That week was perhaps one of the shittiest weeks of my life. I didn't get any sleep. I'd be up all night thinking about her. Non-stop. I wasn't able to distract myself. I could only think about her. I got home absolutely destroyed. But I had hope. Because we were planning to come together for New Year's again. I got to talk to her for about 10 minutes, I think. That was nice. But nothing after that. I got home very, very sad.

The parties that followed were an absolute pain for me. She would be there, but she'd developed other interests, such as dancing. A critical point was somewhere in the middle of March 2019. After one of the parties I got home and cried for 3 hours straight. I hadn't cried seriously in more than 8 months. Perhaps a year even.

I always get a mini heart attack when I get a phone notification, wishing it might be her. She messaged me about two weeks ago, actually. She noticed I'd been quite depressed at the party and other people'd noticed it too. She said that I could talk to her or anyone else if I wanted to.

But I fucking can't. Because I'm introverted as shit. And I HATE that about me. I know that I can't do anything about my introversion and ""that it's a part of me"" but I fucking hate it so much. The signs were there. She liked me, I liked her. If I wasn't so fucking introverted I could've made it work. She even put ""You're keeping me awake at night"" as her status for a couple weeks. But I ignored every single bit of it.

And now I'm lonely. The parties have stopped, I don't talk to my friend group anymore, my ""friend"" I've known for 4 years I can't tell a single thing to. I want someone that I can trust. I want to find a companion. She was that companion. But I've missed my chance, and I don't think I'll ever get another one.

What's there to be happy about? Why be happy if I can't share my experiences with anyone? Why would I do anything at all? Why be happy if I can't laugh with someone, can't feel a sense of affection, can't feel loved? Things I found fun a couple months ago I don't like doing anymore. Why would I do anything? I don't blame anyone for what I'm going through, though. It's all a result of my introversion and me being fuckin autistic. I'm but unwanted garbage at parties -- the only thing I do is sit in a corner and stare at the ground grumpily.

I want everything back. I have so many memories that remember me of those times. It wasn't even that long ago, but the rate at which it is starting to torment me, is increasing. I have become more sensitive to crying at random times, I can't be happy. I feel like I'm sinking deeper and deeper. And I don't think I can get out of it anytime soon.

If you came this far, thanks for reading.

Also, I've probably missed a lot of things. If you have any questions, I will try to answer them.",0
133,"When I say losing my friend, I mean that I feel he's drifting away from me.

I didn't really plan on posting here, but when I tried commenting on r/AskReddit on a post about ""How do you really feel"" this stuff kept pouring out of me so I thought I should post it on somewhere more appropriate. I think that this belongs here, but if it doesn't please point me to the right direction.

I've been struggling with dark thoughts, depression and quite honestly, self-loathing for years. I've felt that way since I was in high school to the time I started college.

It was really hard opening up to new people and I still struggle with it, but I managed to make some pretty good friends and one really great friend.

I've recently realised that when we were hanging out, I didn't have those feelings anymore. I was feeling so good that I didn't feel that way even when I was alone. I'd very rarely get depressed and it would only be about the stuff I had to do for college that stressed me out. I wouldn't feel like I was worthless though anymore. I started to get some confidence back and do things I wanted because I wasn't beating myself down all the time thinking I'm completely worthless and that nobody likes me.

I like to think that all my new friends helped in that. At first, I'd be anxious when I was about to meet them. I was afraid that I'd say something stupid or that they didn't really like me. But now even if I'm not feeling great, if I'm with them I feel alright, I feel like everything's going to be okay.

The one great friend I made though had the most impact on me. The way we met was like destiny or something. There were so many consequences and things we had in common. We were the first person that each other met when we started college in a completely unknown city for both of us. We've done quite a lot of things independently from the rest of our friends and we've bonded a lot over these years. I used to think I'd never have anyone else as close as my childhood friends, but now I consider him to be as close to me as they are/were.

To be honest, I think I've helped him quite a lot too. I've always tried to be there for him when he was having problems, I tried to give him courage when he needed to face a challenge and I've always listened when he needed to talk to someone about his problems. He doesn't really know the good impact he had on me, because he doesn't really do those things, but he's still a good friend in his way.

Recently though I think some of my actions have been quite wrong and I have disappointed him. That, combined with the fact that he has made a new friend that he spends a lot of time with has made me feel that something has changed. Like we're not that close anymore. He talks less to me and arranging stuff without me. I can't help but feel like there's some distance between us now. I can't really describe it. Maybe because it can't be put into words. It's just that ""feel"" of something being wrong that you get from people you know very well, you know? 

It just hurts so much. My friends mean everything to me and even the idea of losing my best friend or even worse that he has replaced me with someone else tears me apart. All those feelings of self-loathing, anxiety, fear and sadness are back, just when I thought I was finally rid of them.

I know that the fact that those feelings being away was dependent on a different person is probably not a very good thing. I think it means that at some point they would come back. But the idea of losing him was bound to create a big problem for me because we are (I like to think we still are) very close. I don't expect losing a person that feels like a brother to not have that result, even to people that weren't feelings those things before. I think it's a reasonable reaction.

I'm just really lost and sad. I feel like crying, but I can't. I don't know what to do. If I share those thoughts with him I might even make things worse. All I know is I don't want to lose my friend and I hate feeling this way. I want to overcome this and I want things to be back to the way they were. That's my driving force for now.

I don't know if anyone will read this or comment on it, but even just writing things down and reading them again has been helpful. I just need someone to talk to about this and even if nobody responds, it feels like someone is listening even though that might not be the case.",0

136,"So, I'm not about to tell you my whole life story because honestly I can't even remember it that well and I might me biased to think I've been mistreated by everyone.
In summary: mom and dad got divorced when I was 4 or 5, went to live with my mom, then my dad won my guardianship.
The thing with my mom is: when I was a kid she would go to work on her boyfriend's bar and leave me alone at home every single night. At some point we even lived at the back of the bar. The other thing is I heard them have sex every night. 
The thing with my dad is that he got married again and they kinda forgot I existed, he would come home from work, have dinner with his wife and they wouldn't invite me, I felt like I wasn't home (he also constantly told me I was too fat) On top of that he wouldn't let me see my friends, I was to go to school and straight back home, even if I had classes all day, I was supposed to come home for lunch. At home I had nothing to do, most of the time I was grounded because my grades weren't good and my room was messy.
His wife was also not that great either, I tried to kill myself once when they weren't home, so since I was grounded, my dad called me when they got back and asked where I was, I told him I was at the hospital and a few minutes later they got there, he asked me why I did ""such a stupid thing"", I responded ""because I wanted to"" and she just left and went home, dad didn't care much either but stayed with me until they stitched me up.
After highschool my dad had never considered the possibility of me not going to college, so I did. I spent 4 years doing something I hated (don't get me wrong, my GPA was 8,4/10) but I just hated it and the thought of having to do that for the rest of my life)
In the meantime (I was living with my mom) I started dating someone for the first time, and around the same time my mom got a boyfriend too, so she went to live with her new boyfriend. So I was in my first relationship at 18, living alone and depressed.
So now here we are, I left college with 6 months left until graduation, I don't have a job or friends, can't tell my dad the truth and my mom is just a terrible choice to ask for advice.
I blame what happened to me for not knowing who I am, I never had any say in any of this and now I not only don't know how to make decisions for myself, but I also don't know what I would like to do. I've been at home doing nothing for about 8 months now and I feel overwhelmed over anything. Specially that I don't have a job and very expensive bills to pay, my dad gives me money every month and my mom was supposed to help but doesn't, and my dad wants me to find a job so he can stop sending money, and I don't know what to do.",0
137,"Hi All. I have a very close friend who has been spiraling downward over the past year and a half. He always had a bit of a dark and pessimistic side, and then he got in a toxic relationship with a girl who used him and his money and then moved on to a younger, hotter guy. That was a year and a half ago and he is still miserable. Every event or gathering he hijacks conversations to talk about how miserable he is. He cries at the bar and breaks down. We try to tell him he needs to seek professional help but he just won't listen. It's at the point where none of us want to invite him anywhere because nothing is fun when he's around. He's a close friend so we know that despite those frustrations we could never abandon him, but at this point it seems selfish for him to not get help and continue to unload on all of us without any intention of ever getting help.

&amp;#x200B;

We decided that maybe we should attempt an intervention of sorts but we want to do it the right way (if there is a right way). Should we only include 4-5 of his closest friends or should we do an 'all hands on deck' scenario? Should we write down a letter and read them like you see in other interventions? Any suggestions or resources would be great. I'm sorry if this is not the correct place for this post.",0
138,"I’ve always struggled with depression, since I was 15 but now I’m 24 and the past 2 years has RIPPED me apart mentally. And just the past 5 months, it’s gotten worse. I have the drive, motivation and interest to do things and go places but my brain and body don’t follow? I allow anxiety to take over and make me think about all of the reasons I shouldn’t go out or should just stay home. I haven’t seen my friends more than twice in these 4 months. My boyfriend lives with me, and hes the only friendly face I talk to. I haven’t left my house by myself in a long time. I go out for a little but come back. I suffer from extreme body dysmorphia and is ALOTTT of the reason i dont go out. I think im too fat and people are looking at me.

I also dont like when people look at me for an extended amount of time, i feel like they’re thinking about how ugly or stupid i am. I’ve made some lifestyle changes to maybe help with my depression and it did for a week. Now im here again, not leaving my house.

139,"To start, a history about my mental health. My mother has a slew of things, ranging from depression, to schizophrenia. My mother's parents and family have a history of depression. My dad's side of things include suicide. From my early ages, one of my greatest struggles was fear of social interactions. I was later diagnosed with avoidant personality disorder and it pretty much runs my life to this day.

I have major depressive disorder, social anxiety, blah blah, but mostly what I'm prescribed is nothing more than antidepressants. I've never had any real luck and I've been on dozens of them, but it's all I've ever been prescribed.

Anyway, fast forward to today. I've been without a job for a while and now my family of 5 is on bare bones. My wife is disabled. I'm 38 and she's 35. She had an injury from her teenage years that has taken all the cartilage from her knee and she's now almost unable to walk. When we met this wasn't an issue.

I'm very educated. I have tons of awards. 4.0 GPA in college, but I couldn't finish because my loans ran out. I was in honors everything in HS and was put into special programs like Gifted &amp; Talented. Valedictorian, top 10% of US students. I could go on. Anyway, I'm jobless now and I've been doing tons of interviews lately. I work in the IT field and I'm most often told I'm overqualified and wouldn't last because I'd get bored. I mean I guess that makes sense when I'm applying for helpdesk roles. It doesn't help when I tell the interviewer about AI I've written, or how I use image recognition in gaming that doesn't need to edit memory so it's not a true ""hack"" per-se and there's nothing on the market like it. Yet I also don't really qualify for a developer role either, since I have no professional experience, only personal. I know I'm not senior level, I just want a chance...

The very best thing about myself is constantly under attack at every interview. Computers are what I know and I've studied since the era of Windows 3.1. What sucks is when I tell them how much I rely on the command prompt and my typing speed and they ask, ""But are you proficient in a Windows environment?"" Jesus... Are you saying I can tear apart games, find pointers, do AOB scans, write LUA, write machine learning, script my scripts, but I've no experience in Windows? Technical recruiters are a joke.

Anyway, I had two interviews today. First was at 1PM, second at 5PM. I'm broke and live 30 miles from the city, so I sat in my car from 2PM (after the first interview with one company) until 4:45PM with second company. Is this not dedication?

I almost cried during the interview. He said he didn't think the roles I'd be given would challenge me enough and I'd want to leave because it wasn't complex enough. I shouldn't have said this, but I said it doesn't matter, because I'll do anything at this point to keep food on the table, and I could promise I wouldn't leave the company for at least a couple of years because I would want to pay back my appreciation for being hired.

What I really wanted to say was... If I don't get a job soon, my family (wife and three kids) will be homeless soon. I cannot handle that and I already have a suicide method planned and waiting for when I hit the complete bottom. I'm incredibly talented and I want an outlet to display this at. I've never met anybody who types as quickly as I do or has the weird unique skills I do. Even though my disassembly of games is of no value to any company, I just want them to realize how far I push myself. Nobody realizes this. My thirst of knowledge is not profitable to a company, and that's the only thing that matters.

I'm starting to break apart. I almost cried during the interview (it lasted two hours... weird...). Well, I guess I didn't start to break apart as I'm already pretty broken. Because of my problems that I cannot tell employers, it's leading to another problem. I have huge social anxiety. Last time I worked in a call center, I attempted suicide and was hospitalized for over a week. Now, there's no more applications left to put in on Indeed, and my recruiter is now looking into call center jobs for me. I'm about to possibly be put back into something that made me try to kill myself. Right now, I'm close to it anyway, but I promised my wife I absolutely wouldn't...

Regardless, I continue to isolate myself more and more. I can't help it... Even why my family tries to interact with me, I have no feelings; I just want to be left alone. If I drink, I finally become sociable, but then it hurts my family. I get two choices: drink and feel normal and sociable, or don't drink and isolate. Neither is good, and with money tight right now, I can't even drink to get away from the pain.

I don't have family (my own or in-laws) to rely on, either for financial or emotional support. I isolate myself so much that I have no friends. Even when I had friendly co-workers, outside of work I'd avoid calls from them... Really, right now I should be hospitalized, but then I couldn't look for jobs and do interviews, etc...

I really, really, really want help right now. Don't be alarmed if I don't reply... It's, again, my fear of being social and how I'm viewed.",0

Today something bad happened and I feel the episodes are returning. Everything is coming back to my 5 years of depression in college. My bad gpa, my lack of confidence everything. And what is the point of even trying if everything is gonna be blocked because I was fucking sick? People who never wanted to off themselves will never understand. I wanted to off myself and I was so sure I was gonna make it that I left behind everything. And now it's coming back. ",0
143,"The longest I’ve ever held a job has been two and a half years, my current position. 

It’s the best job I’ve ever (and likely will ever) have. I work from home as a tech support chat manager, make $15.50 an hour, on a 10AM-7PM schedule.

And yet, I’m depressed and miserable, taking days off work because I’m not strong enough to cope. I go into work everyday feeling that I’m wasting nine hours of my life sitting at a desk, not contributing anything of value to the world, getting anxiety having to type for hours talking to 2-3 people simultaneously and relying on customer surveys to determine if I’ll have a job next month or not.

I do this EVERY TIME. I’m happy to have new job, then the pointlessness of it, the hours I’m wasting away, the asses I have to kiss to get ahead drives me to either quit or get myself fired. This has been my life since I was eighteen. I’ve suffered from this depression for fourteen years. Working makes my depression spiral into a black hole. I abruptly took time off because I was becoming increasingly erratic with my emotions and having thoughts of suicide on a daily basis.

It’s become THAT bad. I’ve been on leave from my job for a month and stuck in this depressive rut, unable to even get my mind in the right place to go back. I’m letting my poor husband down. He works so hard for me and has been supportive of me seeking help and getting on medication during my leave, and here I am, again, ruining our financial situation because I’m too...whatever I am...to keep a job.

I feel like a loser. A failure. I’m beating myself up about it because I’m ruining what will be the best job I’ve ever had, and letting myself and my husband down. I don’t know what to do. I just need someone to talk to, to make me feel that something will work out. Or maybe I’m just asking for a miracle.

I’ve been trying so hard to research business ideas, niches, things I can sell from home that allow me to use my creative strengths to earn a good living, to do something that will give me purpose and meaning. The only time I’ve felt this way is when I was selling. It sounds stupid, I know, but posting things online, having someone interested buy it, listing things for sale was exciting! That’s what I truly enjoy. 

But until I find the right opportunity, I’m stuck in this black hole of feeling worthless, broke, and depressed, disappointing myself and my family with my unreliability. It’s not right that I’ve taken so much time off, neglecting bills, wallowing...but I’m just, stuck. 

I feel like the only one who feels this way. I just don’t know what to do.

144,"Seriously feel stuck, like i cant make a move. Struggling with every decision. I want to move out, but cant because my mum relies on me a little, and we have 2 dogs, who are old.

I  want to go to Australia to visit my brother. Sisters dont want me to go. Probably because they know ill only be coming back to apply for a permanent visa. 

I feel like im stuck in quick sand and everybody else is soaring like a fucking eagle. I saw a picture on the internet, probably Facebook, the whole picture is underwater and there is one person who seems to be sinking into the darkest, deepest waters. Thats how I feel everyday. 

&amp;#x200B;

There was a moment a while back where i was thinking about my family and how it looks, 2 boys, my brother and myself, and my younger sister. My brother is the oldest, then me, then my sister. But to me it feels like they wanted a boy and a girl, they just kept trying until they got the girl they wanted. Was i wanted? I cant ask that question. No parent would tell the truth. 

&amp;#x200B;

My brother is the family man, who wants the kids and the garden with constant contact with the extended family. He is the favourite. Everybody is the family enjoys having him around.

My sister is a strong, independent woman. She really doesnt need anybody, but being a woman, has her circles. The family loves her because she is strong. 

&amp;#x200B;

Then there is me, a loser, failure, and a disappointment. I feel my friends dont care for me. I thought my leaving old job would spur me on to make more moves forward in my life, but im stuck again.

&amp;#x200B;

I thought Scotland with my ex would have been good for me, thinking we would see out the 6 month contract, save loads of money, but that failed. Then Newcastle, my failing to get a job hit me hard. I lost my smile, my joy, my ... spark. I started to sink again, but this time is didnt feel like the slow quick-sand. This was a rapid decent, like free falling from a plane. It was horrible, i'd let my family down, her down, and myself down too. 

&amp;#x200B;

Now ... the water is all around me, sharks are circling. It feeling like im fighting a losing battle against the current.

Maybe I should give up, close my eyes and sink. 

&amp;#x200B;

I just need to find a way to get out of this debt. Work is a very slow process, each day is as long as time itself. But that seems to be the only thing going at the moment. The crappy minimum wage job that a 10 year old can do. Its so degrading.

145,Just found out my ex is dating another person really soon after the breakup.  I didn’t really expect that to happen and I want to try and be happy for her but it’s so damn hard.  So much for her using this year to be alone and grow I guess.  At this point I’ve gone through too many heartbreaks that I feel like maybe I’m better off alone.  At least I won’t hurt from others anymore.  It feels like I could disappear now and no one would care anyways.  ,0
146,"I've always had wanderlust, and a desire to see things and do things out of the ordinary. Recently, things have been extremely tough for me and I'm thinking there's only a few ways out of this mess. Maybe some insight is what I need. I'll try to keep this short and sweet.

Details about my city - It is in shambles. Hypocrites, narcissists and criminals have made this city home, and I want to get away from it. And I'm not just saying that because I want to run; it really is a degenerate's playground. The environment and the people that live here are incredibly toxic. Even our mayor is under FBI investigation. The streets are filthy and of course, there are some wonderful areas but they often become overcrowded with beggars and gangs. Every night, you can hear gunshots and police sirens just outside your window.

Details about me - A year ago, I deleted all of my social media because I had an incident with revenge porn that left me shattered, and I didn't want people to find me online. Everyone in my high school at the time was sharing the pictures, and the comments would make you sick. I still walk into a room two years later and the thoughts consume me - ""Have you seen me naked?"" I was distraught and contemplated suicide for a while. The separation from social media certainly helped my overall mental health, and I have no desire to ever go back. I have lived in the present a little more, and have worked more towards maintaining healthy friendships. Deleteing Facebook made me appreciate the world, and those that have really impacted me.

You should know that I've been suffering for years, and my issues have been made worse after I was targeted. I have bipolar disorder, a monster of an eating disorder, PTSD from a sexual assault in my youth, anxiety (social), depression and basically, I'm a walking disaster. I carry myself with a smile constantly, though. I am warm and approachable with an incredible sense of humor. I am selfless and charitable. You wouldn't know that I'm teetering on the edge. I have no friends because I'm terrified of being close to anyone due to the revenge porn (they're making the rounds online again as of two weeks ago, and guess who's been crippled because of it?) and truthfully, nobody strikes me as being worth the effort. I am ironically hugely into motivational speakers and bettering yourself and finding peace in nature, hiking, etc. And I couldn't surround myself with people that I can't trust. Which is everyone. Because after a messy breakup with a best friend who claimed he browsed revenge porn sites for the thrill of recognising girls he knows, I feel I can't trust anyone. Especially men around my age.

Details about the situation - My uncle lives up here and he's cool. My mom fled domestic abuse and lives in the deep South. We don't talk much, and I have a deep resentment for her. And my father is nonexistent. The only person that keeps me here is my boyfriend. He's a good man. And I mean that. He is honestly one of the best people I have ever come to know. Leaving him is going to destroy what's left of me.

He's tried to get me into therapy and counselling and I failed at that because I can't trust the therapist enough to open up. Instead, I lie, which isn't helping anyone. He's trying so hard but I just want to GO. Run. And without social media or anything, the people harassing me with revenge porn won't find me, old aquanitances won't find me, nobody will find me. I just need to make the choice. Start over somewhere brand new and become the woman I KNOW I can be.

They say that your environment can impact your health and the city I'm living in is toxic. I don't want to run away and don't see it that way - I see it as an opportunity to restart and make peace with all of the pain I've endured. I have about 10k in cash, which isn't much but it's more than nothing. I have a Jeep that has enough space to comfortably sleep in for a short woman. I have very little belongings, no debts, no commitments other than a decent job and a boyfriend I know I'll regret losing. And an itch to get out of here.

I don't have a plan and don't want one. I just want to drive and get the *** out of here and become who I really am without fear of nude pictures disgracing me and shutting me down. What do you think, Reddit?",0

After a date, if the girl doesn't respond back or stops talking then I get more depressed, this happened 3 times in past couple of months. I have started smoking, the thing that I hated most as a child because my dad died when I was a child because of it. When I am alone I constantly think about dying. I haven't achieved anything that I set out to achieve by the time I got 26. I bought ps4, a bike thinking that would make me happy but it didn't. I started gym thinking if I look good, it would make me happy but it didn't, I lost a lot of weight and I am not fat anymore but going to gym seems like a chore, but I still go there. The only reason I haven't committed suicide yet is because of my mother. I always hope that I die in some accident. When I am on a plane, I think that if plane crashes, it would be over now.

It's a funny thing that I constantly find myself coming back here at my weirdest moments. A few days ago I had to leave my beautiful California and return to Washington for the last quarter of the year. Things were fine at first, but alas I find myself broken again.

I don't really know what happened, I just woke up one day and the sparkle of life was gone again. However, I don't really have anyone to talk to anymore. I've used up all my coupons at this point. My girl gets worried sick, I hear the exhaustion in my sister's voice when she tells me once again to see my therapist (it's expensive as hell), and seeing the same old sad face on my friends' expressions when I talk is just heartbreaking.

169,"I want go be apart of a statistic that people pretend to fight for/ care about.

My fiancé and I are in a place of total helplessness, dismay, and numbness. He only speaks of offing himself after drinking, and its not in a way to threaten or make me feel bad. He feels as if as hard as he tries his efforts wont affect the outcome of any situation. He moved across the country about a year ago to live with me. We live in a seperate building on the same property as my grandparents on my fathers side, my parents and my brother.

     My parents were constanty away form home while I was starting school till I was about 12 years old. They were very hands off when it came to my education but my father ""repermanded me"" with violence and a short fuze. This would consist of him running into a room and pinning me down on a rock indoor slab flooring, similar to smooth cobble stone. He would us wrestling hold that were exicuted with him barely holding back. He would wrap around my neck, hold my arms back and wrap my legs with his. I would be looking up at my mom from the ground screaming with what ever air was left in my lungs, ""I can't breath."" Tapping out on his forearm. She would half scream his name and he would pull on my body 20% harder then slowly relax and get up and walk away as I'm left gasping for air on the ground. This would happen till right before I turned 17 when I stood up to him saying this is concidered assault. Parts of my childhood are black voids of memories, fear, panic attacts, and the first word I learned about psychology from my mother when I was 12, Learned helplessness. My fathers anger did disapate eventually. I do believe I paved the way so my brother woudln't have to endure the same abuse. My mother and I endured for so many years of my childhood.

       I was deamed as the trouble child in the family because my grades weren't acceptable in a family of doctors. Literally a family of doctors. Both of my parents are Radiologist, my grandmother a pharmacist with a ph.d., my aunt a dentist, my grandfather a dentist, my uncle a radiologist, my cousin a lawyer, and my other cousin a veterinarian. They all live realativly close as well so the comparison has been on a regular basis since I was 6 years old. Saying that I struggled in school was an understatement. My early years I had teachers pull me by my arms yell in my face and throw me into a detention hall to write my name, sentences, mathmatical equations every recess for its entirity. This took place from Pre-k till 2nd grade. Through out elementary, middle school, and high school homework consisted of most nights working on 2-3 subjects a night each for 4+ hours. I would still bring only mid to low Bs. This was not acceptable. It wasnt until I was 17, I was diagnosed with ADHD prodominatly non-hyperactive. I managed and created tools on my own to battle it with my severe anxiety and depression.

        My brother who is 7 years younger has been able to have little to no parental intrucivness, and academically supported since he could speak. He has been able to test out of 2 courses. Which allows him to not only be the praised child but grants him the ability to update his computer to a i9 with a 1080ti with the newest processor (about 5,000 dollars build  the month they are released. He was 14/15 at the time, so no arguments that he had a job to obtain it. He has actually told me that jobs at resturaunts, fast food joints, and minimum wage jobs as a whole are beneth him. There are a total of 3 computers in his room. Only one tier lower than his ""main"" build. 
      When I asked for the older build he wasnt using anymore, he said I had to pay for it. It was worth at the maximum 230 dollars case and all according to my older cousin and most websites. (5 to 6  years old build) He demanded 1,000 dollars at first, then 800 when I mentioned a payment plan. I told him 800 was ridiculous, but swore it was worth it. After setting it up in my room me agreeing to giving him 200 dollars (which I did) he would later go into my car,purse,  and wallet and steal 380 extra dollars. My grandmother said that he told her I owed him money. When I yelled about it and screamed saying he stole it she defended him and said, ""Im too old to be picking fights with him."" This was the common theme with my grandmother, grandfather, and my father.

          When I confront my mother about his speanding habits of my parents money she yells or has my father yell at me to say,""That none of your concern/you're not his parent/you should be worrying about yourself."" 
After attending college, I was blamed for a 34,000 dollar monthly credit card bill. When I was accused I yelled at my father saying ""LOOK AT THE CHARGES, LOOK AT MY CARD HISTORY! PROVE ME WRONG THAT IS NOT ME!"" I didnt hear from my father about it again. But what I heard from my mother was 20,000 dollars were spent on items for my fathers AV buisness. (He does it on the side) and 10,000 was spent on my tuition payment and grocceries. That 4,000 was all demed purchases my brother made. My parents at the time, along with all the other employees, were let off because the hospital embessed money and went bankrupt.

               I at the time was also recovering from psychosis. It was caused from going 9 days without sleep, 5-7 without sustainable amounts of food and water, whilst previously recovering from a neck injury, and going cold turkey with: birthcontrol, depression medication, adhd medication, pain medication, and sleep medication. (Side note I was perscribed depression med. and adhd meds for over 2 years, and I stopped each of these months apart from eachother.) This happened before my first semester of exams of college. I was able to email my professors maraculoisly weeks before and during my psychois that I had a neck injury and was having trouble day to day. I was granted a medical leave and retured to pass all but 1 exam. Mind you I was deamed to having PTSD, residual hallucinations, and severe paranoia from the experience the psychiatric hospital helped expose me too. My psychologist of many years explained to me I was worse off after than I was the day upon entering.

This was 4 years ago and while my psychiatrist says that its a myrical I recovered cognitively to anypoint that I'm currently at, I have little to no retention of new subject matter in school, and day to day. Abstract concepts continue to trip me up and I constantly wonder what part of me mentally will be contorted/washed. My personality has changed, I used to keep more to myself and take time to perfectly analyze and craft what I would say and information i would retain. Now I'm quick to anger, and feel that I shallowly  thinking of how to phrase my sentences verbally and how to critically think through problems thrown at me. 
My fiancé has too endured psychosis a year before we met that too as situationally provoked.

    Jobwise, I currently work with my fiancé doing graphic design. My previous job was one I worked hard for. I would make melts, and subs, prep the condoments, cleaned the chicken, cooked the chicken, make chicken/ tuna salad, made yogurt fruit cups, took orders, and did dishes. This was all done within one 8 hour shift, no breaks. Yes legally I didnt realize this was illegal till I quit. I quit due to an employee 2 years my junior. She had worked there 3 years and was considered my shift manager when the GM was gone and the boss clocked out. She would steal things out of charity vending machines, blame me for not working fast enough, and try to rope me into doing her work and mine. The best part of all of this is that we had a drive up window (no speaker system) and had only 2-3 people working the entire location. We had another employee who was a year younger than me and 2 months in was offered more of a wage. He he ate food during shifts and would play dumb to shoved all closing/cooking/customer responsibilty to me to leave early or be on his phone. This was all for a $7.50/hr wage. Thanks to my fiancé, I developed some amount of self respect and self worth. I finally question the world and environment I grew up in thanks to him. 
    But, he too has slowly become consumed by the helplessness this place forces you to endure. This culture that pushes for lack of your rights to individual thinking and unquestioning attitude. This stunted environment.
This molding nightmare.
This... hell.

173,"**This is a vent, I honestly don't know to feel so maybe giving my thoughts could help others.**

I know it probably wont interest a lot of you but I'll give you a quick introduction on who I am and what I do so you can understand. 

I am 18, and currently do YouTube/Social Networking full time as my line of work. I also work part time as a NSFW Audio Voice Actor and I do smutty and/or comforting audios for people that needed it. 

*I have been to therapy however, while I have gotten better I still feel fucking terrible.*

I live alone in my small 600 square ft. condo and I haven't seen my mother with the exception of one or two times every other week, both my parents pay for said condo while they live in other places. My mother left to go live with new boyfriend while my father lives alone in a city near mine. 

I rarely eat, and when I do eat I usually just puke it up because I am deathly afraid of gaining weight. 

Over the last 5 months I have been beat over the head over and over again by life (or at least it feels like it.)

I was accused of being a pedophile and lies were sent out to my fans by an abusive friend/sexual harasser of mine, and I have gained PTSD (self-diagnosed) like symptoms from the insane amounts of harassment/death threats from friends and said group who tried to ""expose me"". 

I've created such an incredible fandom and following with supporters from all across the globe, I have an incredible girlfriend who loves me **so dearly**, and I have so many great people in my life. 

How is it though that I feel so **alone.** 

Why do I have to feel bored about everything and anything? 

Why does my huge amounts of creativity have to just **disappear.**

How come I feel like the people around me are untrustworthy?

Everything feels so dirty, and nothing feels clean.

I feel not only tainted by life... But taken, abused, and throat f*cked into another realm of existence.

I don't know what to do. I'm so pitifully sad and just screwed up right now it hurts.

179,"Hi, long story short I moved house and needed meds for Jan thru April because they had a 3-4 month wait at the psych doc I got an appt at. He did prescribe my existing meds for Jan, Feb, and March, but come April he says he cannot. I take Effexor and Rexulti; he sent in the Efxr but says he wont do the Rexulti, which I can't afford since I recently lost insurance and it would be $1k+, nor would he provide Abilify which is a similar drug that I have taken before and tolerated well and would cost $25.

So I have no insurance and no meds. Is there any good reason why they are being so restrictive? I can never speak to the doctor, only the front desk. How can I get the meds I need?

190,"First off this isn't a how to beat depression post. I still feel like shit on a daily basis. But these are some tips that helped me see some light in life and keep the suicidal tendencies at bay. And if they helped me they might just help someone else.

1. **Physical Activity:** First off this isnt a quick natural fix to depression like so many claim it is. But i force myself to walk my ass to the gym 3 days a week and do my sets of 5 reps for squat, bench, and deadlift. It wont make u instantly feel better. At first youl probablly feel like your wasting your time. But just getting yourself there is the hardest step. Noones telling you to go all out, but even if you do a few basic lifts youl gain a sense of pride as your numbers improve over time. If lifting weights isnt your thing, do sets of pullups/pushups/dips, things like that, and try get more done every time. Or just jog. start with a mile or two and gradually work your way up to longer distances. The point is to see the improvement over time and eventually have that improvement as something to look forward to. At the very least, you feel like your doing SOMETHING because I know most days i would feel like im doing absolutely nothing and going nowhere.
2. **Cold Showers:** This is the number one thing that built my willpower when i couldnt even muster up the energy to walk the dog or go to the grocery store, even make breakfast. Every morning i set my timer and take a shower on the coldest setting. Started at 3 minutes and increased in increments of 30 seconds. Am currently at 6 minutes every day. without this I wouldnt have the willpower to do any of the other things on this list.
3. **Talk to people:** Dont have to have an active social life because I know with severe depression thats impossible. But simple things. If your in class talk to people that sit around you. Make small talk with cashiers. say hi to strangers on the street. Just try to make small talk with someone a couple times a day.
4. **Stay out of your head:** This is the hardest one and basically everything else on the list is mainly to help with this. Do absolutely everything possible to not get caught in those negative thought loops. When you feel like laying in bed or sitting on the couch all day stuck in your negative feelings do absolutely anything to get out of your head. Take a walk, put on a song, SOMETHING. or just make it a point not to think about anything.
5. **Dont get caught in the past or the future.** ties in with the last one. Took me a long time to move on from being stuck in the past and obsessing over better days. On the flip side theres the overwhelming fear that life is passing by and the futures bleak and hopeless. Life is happening right now, no matter how horrible things seem, best thing you can do for your mental health is live in the present moment and try and find something, no matter how small, that makes life tolerable.
6. **Determine to feel a little stronger every day.** Even if its just by a tiny increment. Have a stronger attitude every single day. Even if its barely noticeable. Doesnt mean things will actually get any better. But it all starts with that change in mindstate. When i really fixed my mind on this concept it made a world of difference
7. **Find ways to fill your time.** Not all your time, but something consistent. For example, walk the dog at a certain time every day, have a gym schedule, go swimming, enroll in a class or something. Go to church on Sundays if your religous at all. Anything that forces you to get up and do something.
8. **Get your sleep schedule on track.** Wake up and go to bed the same time every day. And get a solid 8 hours of sleep, but not too much more then that.
9. **Eat Breakfast.** One of the hardest things for me to do personally is force myself to eat breakfast in the morning. But your body and brain need to nutrition. try eat something high in proteins and and healthy fats rather then toast/cereal.

&amp;#x200B;

Now im well aware that these things are much easier said then done. Also their most likely not going to cure your depression. 6 months ago any of these things felt absolutely impossible for me, but it all started with baby steps until I got all of the things on the list. Key was dedication and consistensy. Like i said, I still struggle on a daily basis and most days feel bleak and hopeless. But on the other hand I think about suicide considerablly less, I find myself enjoying small moments now and then, I feel glimmers of hope and I feel considerablly stronger and more equipped to deal with my depression then I did 6 months ago. So if it helped me just putting it out there and hope it can help someone else.",0

193,"I hate the way I look. My face is rough and masculine, but not in an attractive way. I look like a thug, someone you'd expect to see waiting to kidnap a small child or stalk you in an alleyway at night.

I look like a criminal, a rapist, a pedophile. Someone who belongs in jail. My resting face is not friendly at all, and my smiles look fake or forced. This is a complete contrast to how I actually am. I'm a geeky guy. I like things like anime, video games, superhero movies. Childish things. My appearance doesn't match my interests or personality at all.  


No one wants to be around me because of how I look. I had someone tell me that I look scary. At a part time job, one girl thought I was creepy and went around telling everyone not to talk to me. I'm only 27 and the realization is starting to sink in that there's nothing I can do to change this. I'm overweight, but even when I was thin it was still the same. The problem lies in the structure of my face and other features that cannot be changed.

197,"My mother has mentally abused me since I can remember. 
The things she has said to me have mentally crippled me.
I will recall as many as I can, most of these are the ones that play in my head everyday.

In  2017 my grandmother got pneumonia, my mother and I sat next to her in the ER and I brought up how I was afraid that my thyroid may be making me infertile (My mothers side suffers with Thyroid conditions, my grandmother had hers removed and my cousin currently has thyroid cancer. He is one year younger than me, I am 27) the nurse in the room with us perked up her ears when she heard me talk about my thyroid. My mother turned to me and told me loudly to ""Tell someone who cares"" the nurse looked horrified and shuffled out of the room. 

Thats just one thing that has stuck with me.  If I ever am diagnosed with a terminal illness, no one will be telling her. 

Here is another crippling thing she has said on multiple occasions. 

If I was to ever get pregnant she would kill my child and me. She has threatened to kick it out of my stomach. (I havent got children, nor do I think I will ever be able to have any) my father doesnt care that she says these things. He enables her shitty behaviour towards me. Might I add I am an only child. 

My grandmother tells me my parents never wanted a child, so I am confused about my existence aswell. 
I have always light heartedly told both of my parents they should have aborted me, but deep down I actually think I would of been better off aborted. They both have always said that when I was born that if I was to come out with some dissability they were going to adopt me out. 
I was diagnosed with ADHD at the age of 4 and was on medication up until I was 16.  
I have always been treated like I am under the age of 5, that I dont know anything and im repeatedly told my brain is a peanut.  

I remember the first time I had ever gotten my period, I was 10 and I knew goddamn nothing about my body and I bled through my undies. When I asled my mother what was happening to me she told me I was a ""Disgusting little bitch"" and she threw a packet of pads at me and told me to change myself, I was given no instructions and had no idea what was happening to me until I sat in my room weeping while trying to read the instructions and information on the pad packet. 

I have written a spoken word poem about my mother that I read to a cafe on mothers day 2018, If you want to me to post it I will. 

Im sorry that this post is such a mess, please forgive me. Im sorry about how long this is and Im sorry I didnt know where else to share my experiences at.

198," I am 18 years old as well as a senior in highschool. I have had depression for many years but usually doesn't effect me as much but lately I have been especially down in the dump but I'm not exactly sure why or how to get out of this stump. I am usually okay on the outside and can distrsct mysellf but my mood is awful, and motiviation is lacking I just wanna be home alone, and be left alone. 

 Lately I have been dealing with financial aid, high school is ending I have to sign up for college. I'm also struggling with getting a job, I'm so broke. I feel like a loser stuck at a dead end. I hate waking up everyday, and perpetually going through a never ending cycle of hell. I have never been so unmotivated in my life even though highschool is just about over. My mom is bipolar manic that I cannot stand living with any longer but feel guilt, and bad for leaving soon as she is in remission from her issues, I still connect her to past trauma. I feel trapped with no hope I have the lowest expectations to refuse getting dissapointed from people, or situations it's just such a morale killer. I am waiting to move out start a new chapter of life get a job but it all seems to not be happening so many months of applying walk ins and false promises, and I just keep fucking it up.

 I am so tired of trying, I cant try anymore I just want sleep, dealing with so much this week, and school absolutely doesn't help. I can't get therapy due to being absolutely broke with no coverage, I have a mentor which is simmilar but I can't really completely open up to about this to this extent. I also talk to my girlfriend about this stuff but I cannot bounce out of it this time.

My sister while ruining my living situation also ruined my job promotion (we worked for same company separate locations) which in turn ruined the job.  I own a single pair of heels (they happen to be irreplaceable) that this puppy destroyed along with my new knife set I got for Christmas (didn’t open it for months bec it’s like the 3rd nicest thing I own and I wanted them to stay nice) got stuck with a puppy I didn’t want or ask for and can barely afford but that’s cool. I’m in a ton of debt and I have no degree and am virtually unemployable now unless I work in fast food which was detrimental to my mental health. I have 3 friends that I talk to maybe once a month. I have a fiancé but he just doesn’t understand how hard everything is for me now. I thought I had my entire life planned out but people keep ruining everything for me. And I wanna take some responsibility for it but I literally am not to blame for anything, like I stay up at night and think about decisions I made that weren’t necessarily wrong choices they just led me to people who only wanted to hurt me. For example if i just tried harder at my job and got the promotion a year before like I was promised and if I just didn’t care that the new management wanted me to start over all the work I put into my promotion, if I just started over then and really focused on moving up instead of giving up I’d probably be a manger right now. then none of this would’ve happened. I have no purpose, 10% of my belongings, no real job, no higher education, an apartment that’s probably illegal to rent out because it’s not livable and a major safety and health hazard, I have thousands of dollars of debt to catch up on and worst of all is the car part. That cat is the only reason I didn’t kill my self 5 years ago and to have someone take him from me and not even know if I’ll ever be able to get him back is terrible. I just wanna stop existing and not have to care about anything anymore bec I just hate my miserable existence.

I just wanna know I’m not alone and that it gets better and I can turn it around, I wanna get my life back to how it was when it was at least tolerable and not literally painful to have to wake up everyday.

215,"sorry ahead of time for poor format, grammar, and if i don’t capitalize my ‘i’s, i’m on mobile

(17, F) I was diagnosed with major depressive disorder when i was 14 and i’ve never gotten better since then, just short bouts of worse depression. Not long after i was diagnosed with anxiety and ended up going to a PHP for a few months before returning to full-time work and full-time school. About a year later I quit my full-time job and mostly dropped out of school. That was July 2018. A few months ago PTSD was added to my diagnosis after meeting a new psychologist. That’s about it for my mental medical history up until now.

I live with my boyfriend and his grandparents in the lower level of their duplex (his grandparents occupy the upper level). I don’t go to school most days and I didn’t have a job until now. I stay in bed sleeping, playing on my phone, and very occasionally drawing when i feel up to it. This is my entire life, no exaggeration or cutting on details, this really is all I do all day everyday.

The past few months due to my inactivity I hardly eat, not even a full meal a day, not even snacks. I know this is unhealthy but i feel like for me it works because i don’t need much energy to do nothing all day.

231,"So my uncle(M50) is depressed. He hasn't explicitly said it but it's very obvious. I live with him in my dad's old house (long story). He recently got our of his relationship with his 'wife' (I don't think legally married).. and his kids won't even talk to him anymore because his ex is a manipulative bitch. So yea. He's having a hard time. 

I need advice on how to handle talking to him about the mess... He has always been a pretty messy person. Not just messy but dirty. Living in a gross home causes me a lot of anxiety, frustration, anger etc etc. I can't stand it. I'm usually the one who has to clean it all up because I've been avoiding talking to him about it all. I've been avoiding it because I don't want to cause a fight and I don't want him to think I hate him or am angry with him.. it just has to change. 

Since January I have gone to visit Toronto three times and everytime I've gone I've been nervous to go back home to see what state the house is in since I'm usually away for a week or two. EVERY TIME I've come home to a huge mess everywhere. The kitchen a disaster. Food left out for weeks. Dirt on the floor. Clutter all over the living room. I honestly don't understand how one person can make such an incredible mess. 

This time I came home, it was the last straw. I tried giving him the benefit of the doubt, but after a consistent pattern and also coming home to him smoking in my father home/my childhood home after he had been asked not to, and agreed... I'm done. I have to speak up and say it's not ok. 

Now. What I need advice about, is how to talk to him. Because he's depressed, I have been having a really hard time figuring out how to talk to him about this stuff. I'm sure part of why he's nest is because he just doesn't care about his space anymore because he doesn't care about himself.. I feel bad for him. But I just can't live with it anymore. I don't want to add to his sadness. I don't want to shove things in his face that he already knows. But I also need him to understand how it makes me feel. I don't like feeling nervous to go home and seeing mess and crap every where. 

Any advice or thoughts on the situation would be helpful. I thought it would be helpful to hear from people who may know what he's going through and feeling.. idk. ",0

241,"Hello. My names Ben and I'm really messed up right now.

&amp;#x200B;

I've got low lying anxiety and depression caused by my extended family fucking things up for me. Plus, well this is the main bit;

&amp;#x200B;

I've been on painkillers (codeine, Tramadol, Dihydrocodeine at various times but not all at once) for maybe 3 years now. I was first on Codeine and Tramadol (together) but I could feel my brain starting to go a little crazy on tramadol. So I stopped from a doubled dose, cold turkey, and suffered a fortnight of sever depression. I went to my doc at this stage and she just smiled at me, saying ""oh it'll get better"". It did, but! Holy hell I was apocalyptic. Throughout it all though I had my left over medication just sat right beside me and not once did I consider taking it. I'm proud of that.

&amp;#x200B;

I came off the meds and everything grew brighter. My old self returned. You should see my old self... I can achieve anything. And I sometimes did! 

&amp;#x200B;

But the pain returned. I visited the doc and they put me on Pregablin instead. Now if you don't know about that it's a nerve painkiller that's used for a range of things like anti-anxiety, pain killing, some other things I forgot. But I found it fixed every party of me! Before I said my old self was great, and it is, but it's also sometimes shy. Pregablin fixed that for me. It makes you so confident, it's like being drunk but you're in full control. It's a wonderful energy. However it soon reaches tolerance level and no matter how much you take you can't get that painkilling/anxiety fixing feeling back.

&amp;#x200B;

So I quit that. In time I quit that 3 times over, heh. It was actually easy to come off for me except the final time, where I was an emotional wreck for days.

&amp;#x200B;

But now I'm on dihydrocodeine. I would take it in excess. Twice what I was supposed to. Which is down from what I USED to have (weeks worth of it in a single dose, but lower than what others online take). BUT it's causing me such major depression. For real. I feel down 24/7, sometimes feeling a spark of joy when I wake up. It was a trap. When I first took it I felt good. Then it stopped doing that so I took more. That good feeling never came back. I'd just take it, psychosomatically, in large doses expecting it to make me feel better. But it never did! I'd only feel bad.

&amp;#x200B;

So now like I say I'm reducing my intake. I've calculated that the furthest I've gone without a dose meant I had like half a tablet in my body. When I reach that point my mood doesn't change. But I expect that when I have my next dose that I'm going to feel amazing. Of course I never do.

&amp;#x200B;

this is all so fucked up. Right now I feel like going to the hospital emergency room and confessing all.

249,"I had a head trauma 2 years ago when I fell off a cliff. Broke my leg too. Apparently I found out that I forgot a bunch of stuff about my childhood. I had huge blank spots and really ever since that fall I never thought much of it. Well after finding out from cousins a year ago that I forgot a lot I’ve been connecting a web. It was passive, not much interesting stuff and it was a slow process. However, recently I found a traumatic memory of my dad beating my mom. I already knew he did this shit but it was hard seeing it vividly. 

Being rushed with so many memories of him hurting her at home or in public. Purposely tripping her after altercations or yelling at her. I also remember the screaming and yelling of my sister and him always fighting with more often than not turned physical too.

Usually my sister took out all her anger at me by hurting me. She was angry he never mistreated me. She would give me alcohol to laugh at me and hit me.

I have nightmares now

Also fast forward to literally the day I woke up in the hospital. I made this friend over social media a month back or so. She was a 9th grader while I was a 7th grader. She convinced me to go with her and forget about my current girlfriend; she took advantage of the fact of how mentally unaware I was. She messaged gf1 and told her to fuck off basically. I dated the 9th grader (gf2). gf2 would continually shower me with stuff and I was super happy (memory loss really clouded that trauma i talked about) and then we became semi-sexual. It was rather quick. Eventually she cheated on me, manipulated me into thinking it was my fault and I had to make it up. Fast forward a couple weeks and she’s in my room basically forcing me to have sex with her. I break and let her take control; my first time was not good for me. I was a guy used by a girl and it was a huge blow to me as everybody shunned people like that. I wasn’t “abused” “used” or anything like that, I just didn’t find her “hot enough” according to some friends. I broke up with her shortly after. I was also bullied in school for cheating on the gf1 as she was rather popular.

I was empty and felt like I had no purpose. A kid with no bank of good memories to make times better, only rotten ones left by gf2. A kid broken and afraid. I was bullied relentlessly for being fat, lonely, and weird. A kid who had forgotten himself. I tried suicide and just like everything else: i failed. It was my dad’s turn to have me for the week and unexpectedly he come home early to find his son on the floor dying. He brought me to the hospital and I lied with some bullshit I honestly forgot and I got away with it. I also cut so much I have 48 distinguished self harm scars. However I waited it out

A lot happened since then and ultimately i’m a lot happier. I’ve been with a  new girlfriend for a year now and she’s amazing. I’m at an amazing highschool. I get... decent grades. And although the trauma still hurts a lot I’ve been a lot happier and I’ve made more memories.

Summary is; the trauma sticks forever. I have mental images of a ruined childhood scarred in my brain. I have real scars. I have chronic pain in my legs because my parents couldn’t afford physical therapy and follow-ups. There’s still blank spots in my memory which I suspect to be the good memories.

But that’s the past, the future is what matters. Of course it may haunt you, but you can improve the defense. I have a defense of love and friends. I have the defense of a good therapist. Build one that makes you happy and motivated. Be you and be strong. You all got this. ",0
250,"Throwaway because I know friends know my main account. I woke up this morning at around 10AM to the sound of my mother vomiting. I felt so bad that I didn't go to help her or say anything, but I've never known how to react to stuff like that.

I spend all day online per my usual routine, dulling this pain and hiding myself away from my own family. I'm 20 and unemployed, not in school either.

257,"Some days are harder than others, but that feeling that sinking feeling that washes over you out of nowhere is so debilitating. I can't really explain it when it happens, and I'm not usually thinking about anything particular.

I have things that have gone on in my life that would make anyone depressed I guess, but I don't dwell too much on it. I had testicular cancer in April 2017 and had a testical removed, I've had some massive dental issues I'm in between getting fixed, and the temporary partial I wear feels weird at times. I just moved back home with my parents at 36 for a month after a 7 year break up temporary, till my new place is ready at the end of the month. 

I also detoxed off suboxone (opiate maintenance) after 10 years last July. Didn't realize how depressed months out I get and how hard it be mentally after the physical symptoms went away. My doc has me back on it in micro doses, on an as needed basis and it makes me feel like a failure. Sometimes I go 9 days without it and some weeks I may take it every other day or 3 days in a row. It's a dangerous crutch to play with. Although it is a micro dose compared to what I was on, and pretty much treats severe bouts of depression. I lean on it during stressful times with school I guess, to focus and clear the cobwebs from my brain, regain focus and keep harmful thoughts away. 

My docs plan is to work lamotrogine into the mix as I space the other med out and eventually stop taking it. I'm scared of possible repercussions of withdrawl....however I know it won't be as bad as 10 years at high doses.

A lot of good things financially have happened for me...but my life has def changed a lot in the last 2 months. For now it's been taking things one day at a time in my life to get what I need to get done for that day. Adjusting to the new living situation has gotten me down.

I got bumble to see if I could meet some people out of it but both the people who I have been talking to have gone silent the day or the day before we planned to meet up, and maybe it’s my fault? Maybe I didn’t give them enough attention, or maybe they thought I wasn’t interesting/attractive enough? Idk

And also they guy that I had some feelings for (and is now with my friend which is btw a whole other story) has been real shit to me lately. I thought he was nice but he told me that I have no ass and to shut up when I wasn’t even talking. He also said I was no help when it came to things like projects etc. 

Also my presentation which I had today didn’t go well and I didn’t try hard enough and I did poorly.

I’m probably just wanting someone to tell me it’s okay or some shit, or maybe someone should just tell me that I’m ugly and worthless and I’ll just stop trying.

Tl;dr - I’m feeling pretty worthless and pathetic and unloveable rn ",0
259,"How to deal with depression and get back to your life.

The first step is to accept that you are not where you want to be in life.
Next, you must identify the cause.
For instance, if you are feeling depressed, it is because some aspect of your current state is making you unhappy. 
Wether it be the people you’re surrounded by, your profession, a relationship or yourself, you’ve got to identify the problem. 
Once you’ve put your finger on it, you have to address and fix the issue, this will take time but don’t lose hope.
If it’s got to do with the current circle of people you interact with on a daily basis, move on and cut your losses, you will make new friends. If it’s your own family, speak with them and try to get them to reason with the way they make you feel. Assuming that you’ve tried enough times and it has not worked, save up enough money to move out on your own or move in with a friend. On the occasion that the problem is your girlfriend,spouse or wife, communicate the issue with them and do your best to work it out together. You may also want to get an unbiased third party such as couples therapy to better understand each other without fighting. Supposing that nothing’s worked, it’s time to swallow your feelings and move on, give each other time and focus on your life without them. Your happiness and mental health comes first. You must let go of the fear of not being able to find something better because you will; as it is in the case the problem lies with your profession. Ask your boss for personal time off and explain your situation. Granted that you are still unhappy, I do not recommend quitting without having a plan. You should always be looking for better career opportunities even if you are happy with your job. Save up enough money to support yourself for some time if you have not found a better job but you feel you must quit. The most common cause for depression is being unhappy with yourself. Whenever this is the issue, you must analyze yourself and find what exactly you don’t like about yourself. 
Your appearance: learn to accept your imperfections if you have no power over them. They are what make you unique but they do not define you. Look up a new haircut or hair color you find appealing and try it out. Buy self care products, such as lip scrubs, face mask/wash, moisturizers, make up and create a morning/night routine that makes you happy. If it is something you can change, such as your weight, see a nutritionist to find a diet that suits you. Begin exercising, even if it’s minimal like going for a 15 minute walk everyday but make it a custom. It takes time and dedication but you’ll start feeling better little by little. 
Your social skills: Everyone has trouble talking at first, no one is born with people skills. You must work and cultivate them like any other skill. Find someone you are comfortable with such as a family member and develop your skills with them. Work your way into striking up a conversation with a stranger but be ready for failure, as it is part of life. Nevertheless, every failure will only make you more experienced, hence better at this and any skill you develop. 
Lack of personality: Often when dealing with depression, you find yourself feeling like an empty shell of the person you used to be. It is important to remember that you have not lost your personality, it is just being overtaken by your depression. In this instance, it helps to surround yourself with people that care for you and do things you enjoyed before your depression. It will not bring your personality back instantly but it’ll get better day after day. Isolating yourself will only make it worse. 
Lack of interests: Depression makes every aspect of your life seem boring. Things you used to love will seem pointless. This is what causes most people to dig themselves a deeper hole in their depression pit. Time is of the essence here, you can’t rush out of this stage. You’ll need to be patient and continue going out and doing activities even if it seems mundane. Eventually you’ll regain that spark and love of life but it will take time. 

The key to getting better is to try new things, experiment and find what makes you happy. We are born as individuals so we feel we are alone often but that is not the case. There is always someone out there ready to lend a hand or an ear so ASK FOR HELP. I promise it will get better so don’t give up. Depression is a battle a lot of people have to deal at some point in their life. YOU ARE NOT ALONE. Take all the time you need to deal with it at your own pace, everyone’s got a different battle to fight so don’t let others compare and belittle you. The hardest part of recovering is letting go of what’s hurting you. Don’t put so much importance on what other people think of you, you must climb your mountain and reach the point where you’re happy with yourself. 

Make sure to see a therapist/psychiatrist if your depression persist. There is no magic pill to cure it instantly but it will help. Keep seeing them regularly to monitor your progress. Sometimes too heavy of a dose of medication can numb your brain and keep you from functioning properly so you must find a dose that fits you. DO NOT STOP TAKING YOUR MEDICATION WITHOUT YOUR PSYCHIATRIST’S RECOMMENDATION. Even if you feel better, your depression can come back and most times worse than before. 

Good luck everyone, hope this helps at least one person. ",0

It has caused me to lie in my bedroom by myself for hours everyday thinking and analyzing about what I am doing and what others are doing and why they do it. The more I think about it the more I can justify either side of a decision, and this is dangerous. When I feel like either side can be correct it feels like my choices don’t matter because everything is subjective and is based on perspective. It’s gotten to the point where I’m losing motivation to pursue anything or to build relations with anyone. The dream of investing into a bright future gets foggy and seems irrelevant. All the food is starting to taste the same and my days seem repetitive. I try to convince my self in lies in order to make things matter more and it works a little but when I realize what I’m really trying to do myself I just feel worse. It’s unpleasant that I have to set myself in a false reality to do anything and the more I’m aware I’m doing this, the more the effort itself become futile. Everything is starting to seem meaningless and it’s overwhelming me because this is scaring me.

267,"Ten years ago I was confident in knowing my purpose in life. I was confident that I came through the abuse, neglect, and abandonment I suffered as a child and adolescent without falling into the pitfalls of alcoholism, drug addiction, or violence so that I may serve a purpose. I was on the path to fulfill that purpose. There were signs I was on the right path. And though it was challenging I was adamant that would serve my purpose, and fulfill a destiny which made all that I was denied in life worth it.

My hope and ambition were taken from me. I've accepted a job in which very little is asked or expected of me.  I read nearly all day. The irony is that much of what I read is both a reminder of what inspired the goals on which I've given up, as well as that which lead to my downward spiral into despair. I want to die. I don't want to kill myself because that would hurt the one person I know loves me. So every day I go on living just to be alive, but I've been dead inside for years.

I'm nearing 29  years old in April and feel that i have not accomplished nothing throughout my life. I dont have a place of my own yet especially living in the Bay Area which does not help. I have not been in a relationship in over a decade which is due to me being pretty much timid and shy but that's how I grew up most of my life. I have no college education, so I've been working in a warehouse doing general labor work. How do find that spark to do more or to be more outgoing?  I want to be able to socialize more without being awkward. Does all this clasified as being depressed?

It’s really loud when I’m off my meds. The meds don’t help much, but they muffle the voice kinda. I feel like I’m gonna die but they probably wouldn’t care if I did anyways. I need people to know this. I don’t know why, but I feel like I need people to know. I’ve lost number of my attempts and they only change my meds and listen to me when I hospitalize myself. They only “care” about me when I’ve hopped over that edge. The system has failed me so many times. They say they make sure no one slipped through the cracks, but I’ve fallen down a deep ass sinkhole and they haven’t even batted an eye. I just keep having those urges to kill myself and they’re so strong that I’m practically twitching as a type this.

WHAT SHOULD I DO? Please help!!!

Sorry this is long:
I had a panic attack tonight, it was the second one I’ve ever had and it was scary. My friends and I were at a party which isn’t my thing because I always feel nervous or uncomfortable at them. I only go in order to spend time with my friends and in some ways I believe it’s one of the only ways to meet people here. I’m the only introvert in my friend group which gets rough sometimes because I feel like they don’t understand me. 
The panic attack was scary, I just  remember getting more and more tense and my breathing became more labored and I started to shake so i decided to leave the party.  I had a breakdown in my car, crying uncontrollably and all and I decided to stay in the parking lot because I didn’t want to leave my friends stranded since they didn’t have money and I was the only one with a car I waited two hours for them to come out because I didn’t want their fun to be ruined. When one of my three friends came back to the car, I told him what happened and he said I should’ve said something but he said “oh god” like he was annoyed with me like “oh here we go again”

That made me shut down further. Once my other friends came back I drove us Home and cried the whole way there. After dropping the first friend off, I told The other two what happened and I didn’t get one reaction whatsoever. They just kind of ignored it and continued a conversation which hurt and i started crying more. One of the friends consoled me a little after I kept trying to tell them how scary it was for me and that I was suffering, but it hurt that she didn’t do anything until I had to say “I know y’all probably don’t know how to respond but...” over and over. The other friend didn’t acknowledge it at all and kept going about her business.  This genuinely hurt my feelings and I never talk about my feelings so i just felt invalid when I finally opened up for once. I found some solace in my two friends in another state that I called but i needed someone who was physically there. It further solidified the fact that I’m kind of the odd one out in the group. I’ve been crying off and on, but what do you suggest I do? I feel so hurt and disappointed by them but am I overthinking this? ",0

287,"Hello, I’m an INFP male. It is a personality type for those of you unaware.

Being an INFP male makes me not fit in properly socially. This is because I feel as though I’m not man-enough in certain scenarios or situations where I need to be. However, at times, I can het get too masculine that I become cold.

An INFP is one who tends to be idealistic- ‘diplomats’ of our society if you will (though it never really feels that way). This is because we try to see the good in everyone and everything. INFPs are known to listen more than talk due to their ability to connect with other people’s emotions. A softy at heart basically.

Now, I am a 19-year old Lebanese dude whose been living in Canada for the past year by now (studying abroad with no family members in the country). You can imagine that these qualities don’t usually make me better fit to retain a female in relationship. They also make me look like somewhat of a ‘wuss’.

As INFPs, were also prone to depression and suicide and guess where I’m at now...

P.S. I do understand that the Myers-Briggs test isn’t that accurate, but I’ve repeated the test several times and gotten the same results multiple times enough to figure out my type of personality.

Time goes on and a couple of months into it she suggests that I should come visit.  I am seriously, seriously on cloud 9 about it. I get my tickets and we start making plans for the trip.

It's not, ""I'm going to be there for a week, we'll have plenty of time.""  It's ""Why do you bother putting yourself out there?  You know you don't deserve it. ""  
  
It's 50 pounds of over-reaction and depression in a ten pound bag.  And it's making me absolutely bonkers.  
  
To make matters worse, I wasn't able to completely hide that the change upset me...and I don't know how to explain to her that I understand, but my depression and self-loathing don't.  I don't know how to explain that, through an entirely reasonable set of circumstances, she stumbled head-first into one of the most heinous bits of my battle with depression... The belief that I really am a monster who doesn't deserve to be loved.  
  
How do I explain that it's not her, it's me... and how such a relatively small thing can so dramatically effect me?  
  
How do I convince someone I'm fairly rapidly falling in love with that I'm not that monster?  That maybe, in some way, I might even be someone worthy of her love.",0

296,"Our life is so indescribably meaningless in the grand scheme of all existence, that it actually makes me depressed. As humans, we feel like we’re the dominant species of the earth, we feel accomplished when we do big things. However, the depressing truth is, that we’re just sort of there. Our existence on this planet and our impact on everything is too insignificant to put in words. This earth is billions of years old, and we’re lucky enough if we live past 100 years. Even incredibly widely regarded people’s impact on society is meaningless relative to the whole history of existence. Everything we’ve done on earth is just going to be gone one day. Dying is so confusing for me as well. I was born into a religious family, but nowadays I question my beliefs. It seems more logical that nothing happens when we die, but at the same time it doesn’t. How do you feel nothing forever. When you sleep, you wake up eventually. When you die, you don’t. You have to feel something if you feel nothing, but you can’t if you don’t have a brain to feel anything. It just hurts my head thinking about it. I’m not depressed in general, it’s just that sometimes this comes to mind and it makes me feel really down. I don’t even know if anything I’m saying makes sense to anyone else, but if it does, it would really make my day if someone changed my perspective.",0

The thing is, I am absolutely terrible at taking exams (even if I know the material—I just get so anxious that my mind goes completely blank) and I was having a pretty bad depression day today to begin with. Should I just straight up tell my professor I’ve been suffering from depression this semester and have been in the process of changing medications? It’s been causing me to miss class  and not give a shit about grades. I don’t want it to sound like I’m using depression as an excuse—I know I’m at fault, but this semester has just been so rough on me. Has anyone else explained their situations to their professors?

My financial situation isn’t great family wise so there is the stress or necessity to keep it. I only have a few weeks left, hopefully everything gets better but that is what I’ve been telling myself for years. I’m still amazed I’m pulling off the kind of grades and exam scores I’m getting while my anxiety has been at its worst ever. Just trying my best to hold on. For like 30 more days.

I have an appointment with my therapist next week, but idk if I feel comfortable sharing with him my dark thoughts just yet

It’s tough. People ask me how my weekend was or how am i doing and I just lie and say “it was fine” or “doing great!” but I just feel more shitty lying. Time goes by too fast I feel like I haven’t done anything, and time will continue to go faster as I age while i do absolutely nothing but stay at home in my room.

The past three weeks have been rather bad, and I told my partner about how it was going a week ago. He’s become frustrated that I haven’t been responding to his advice very well. I can’t explain to him that I can’t just think happy thoughts and be positive. I’ve been trying my best to but I just can’t. There’s something stopping me. All I feel is guilt and pressure and I don’t know what to do anymore. The other day, he asked me why I just couldn’t be happy. I hate myself more for not being able to be happy. I felt so selfish.

That night, I couldn’t sleep. My head was filled with thoughts of suicide, and I made a plan on how to kill myself. I knew it was wrong, but it felt like the most sensible thing to do. I feel terrible and I can’t bear to see my partner worried off his mind.

I regret everything. I shouldn’t have told him anything. I should have told him that I was fine every time he asked me. It would’ve been a lot easier that way. We haven’t been talking much now, and I don’t know what to do anymore. ",0

2) Set goals

3) Exercise

I don’t doubt some people would have looked as I passed them, but nobody made me feel like shit, and when I was paying for the milk and a sneaky chocolate bar, the checkout woman stared at my extended arm for a moment and gave me a huge smile and said “Stay strong, you’ve got this”. 

I left the shop feeling a little less alone and invisible with some faith in strangers restored, and it honestly just felt nice. I have nobody else in my life I could share this to, so it felt okay to share it here.

i asked for help, able ran away from parents and marry to a foreigner. he is very kind, take me to doctors, don't complain about medical expenses and don't mind i have lot of sickness and mental problem. i was at my worst want to die a lot, lost a lot of interest in life. i can't work now, but i have been trying my best to study hard from zero everyday so i can earn some money in the future.

then now everyday i do activity (drawing practice mostly) with always in the mind  mom in law said ""having me is only bring deficit to this family and made her very tired"". so a lot of urge to suicide is strong. it's really distracting and i just want to give up.

my husband said to solve this dilemma is use MONEY POWER to shut off everyone. but i'm far from perfect. i'm still not good and far from ready to earn money. i tried to open commission 2 years ago, it didn't work well, bad draw, i'm very anxious and don't have confidence.

I’m getting into old destructive habits and I have an overwhelming feeling of loneliness. It doesn’t make sense, because I’ve got a family who loves me and a really dedicated and caring friend. 

At first, I thought I just needed more friends but I think I was just trying to fill that hole.

I spent a lot of afternoons and nights alone in bed wishing for somebody to call me or ask to hang out. Last week my best friend picked me up and we hung out for a long time but I still felt that pit in my chest.

That’s the thing I hate about this. When I’ve got everything, food, friends, family, a roof over my head, I still feel that wanting. And I don’t know what I want. 

It makes me feel worse and guilty for not appreciating everything that I have. I just want to break this cycle and get back to my normal self.

I’m really getting tired of putting on a face to get through the day, just barely convincing myself that I’m good enough for the world.

I lived in a monochromatic desert devoid of any features. Just desolate colorless, wasteland. Real life could be outside on a sunny day with people around me but I felt completely alone in a flat world of gray a deathly dry wind.

338,"Every time I miss my brother I end up re-playing this game. It seems so long ago, but the emotions I feel while I play are still the same. I make the same choices me and my brother made 15 years ago. I still give the same stupid nicknames to the aeons. I still don’t know how to play blitz ball. And I still remember where all of the Albhed dictionaries are.

My brother and I ended up dumping like 500hrs into that game, back on the ps2. We got almost everything. And thinking of it, it was some of the most fun I’ve ever had in life. Now that I live 6000+ miles away from him, I can just play and remember. I knew I wouldn’t have seen him again the moment I left. But hey, I can just treasure those days, and text him the game screenshots to start a conversation.

I’ve played 8hrs today. But it doesn’t feel like I’ve wasted my time. Because it still feel exactly the same. Even though when I comment, he’s not there to answer or laugh with me.

339,"I'm a (31f) and this last year I finally had enough of feeling the most terrible I ever have in my life so far. I've struggled since I was a child, and never really committed to a medication or therapy of any kind for all kinds of reasons.

Almost two years ago my husband needed to see a doctor for his shoulder and had to be seen by a doctor he's never seen, but we loved him so much that months later I chose him to become my new general practitioner.  He's helped me get my life on tack. I make every appointment, and I do not miss for any reason.

Finally able to smile again. I've had the strength to cut unnecessary people out of my life, and after almost 15 years I'm journaling again to keep my mind in check. I know medication doesn't solve everything, but finding the right doctor really helped jump start a way back to myself. I'm a better wife and mother. I'm learning to let the petty shit go and move forward no matter the situation. I've always been estranged from my siblings, but am finally able to put forth the effort to forge relationships with them.

I still have hard days. And thoes days can sometimes string together and seem insurmountable. But they pass. It's ok to mope a little, but I've learned how to reach out and ask for help. Journal some thoughts down, play a game, read a bit, and good night's sleep can do wonders.

I hope my short story can give someone hope. I was a terrible alcoholic who smoked a pack a day, and am almost a year sober and smoke free. My husband was worried I was going to kill myself with how badly I drank. It is possible to find help, good days are so very possible. Feeling better is so very possible.

340,"Casting the circle

We want to set off under an auspicious sign.  We would most love to begin with the best of conditions.  We really would.  In the past, nothing seemed quite right for this; it was never quite “the right time.”  We are somewhat sensitive, and admittedly, rather fussy.  But as I have said, in this world, this body, this mind, there is little magic left.  There is a slight pulse, however, and there is a halo of events, from which we may pluck here and there to construct some semblance of a narrative.  But we do believe that the conditions we work under are anything but conducive to the endeavor.  And time is not our friend, either.

Walk away

The air seemed so alive, back then.  There was a charge that you could feel as you breathed in the October chill, something beyond paired oxygen atoms vibrating inside of your lungs.  Everything was completely different in those days; now everything is dry and lifeless, it seems.   Smothered.  Or maybe it’s just me; maybe it’s just that I’ve become numb to it all.

Reunions

There is something so delicious about not participating in things.  Something about being invisible, forgotten, rare.  Erasure, but still I’ve always been there, languished, but living no less.  You could almost call it a fetish of mine; it does give me a thrill.  Knowing that the glasses are clinking, the people are chattering, laughing, joyous, all without me.  Some would find it pitiable, being left out like that, but then again most people aren't insane.  Personally, I get a shudder when I think that yes, yes, it’s possible they may not even mention my name.  They may not even think of me, either.  An odd, quiet moment away from the fray – but no, still nothing.  I’m not even there in spirit.
Explanations for all this are quite beyond me.  All I can tell you is that obscurity is love.
And maybe it’s that I’m too dead for you, or maybe it’s that I’m too alive.  All I know is that I don’t want to be here anymore.

Objects

I sometimes think about… what if.  What if things had gone this way, what if I had traveled elsewhere, held on longer?  What am I missing now?  What if I didn’t crash and burn?  What if the accident never happened, and I never got sick?
I remembered that when I was a child, there was a pair of bicycles in the garage.  My mother had bought them for us to ride together, but I was afraid of falling, and so for a long time, they remained unused.  And I remember one night that I cried myself to sleep thinking about them, thinking about the loneliness they must have felt in the dark, dusty cold.  But I still never wanted to learn.

Veins

Often I wonder about all the little things I must have missed.  It drove me crazy sometimes; the world was so massive and unforgiving, unapologetic in its fullness.  There were so many things to look at, so many tender, growing, beating things.  Everything, every single thing, has a heart that beats its own peculiar song, and you wanted to cradle each one, nurture and tend to each, to learn all their songs.  You must have missed so much, but you didn’t mind back then.  You were living; you were one of those growing, crawling, throbbing things.  You had your own song, and there were those who had heard it, and those who still remember it by heart.
Within each atom there is an entire throbbing universe, if we could only peer deeply enough.  The awful truth, however, is that infinity is not enough.

The golden age

It seemed there was a time when everything around was animated by this autumnal bliss.  The world must have held you tighter back then… back then. 
What’s the difference between then and now?  The air hasn’t changed at all; no, it is me.
Back then… There is always a glorious past that we are relating our present moment to.  And necessarily, the present must be an unfulfilled and delirious moment, warped by frustrations and anxieties, with a tenebrous future awaiting us beyond its veil.
When, why, how did I manage to get this way?  What drove me so crazy?",0

&amp;#x200B;

Backstory this is a story from one of my darkest times of my life. I wanted to die

&amp;#x200B;

After sevral years in a violent relationship were physical and mental torture took place,i managed get out with my toddler.

&amp;#x200B;

I knew i needed help since i was in no shape to care for a small kid in my mental state. Thereby i set myself on a wait list to get into a psyciatric ward.

&amp;#x200B;

Time passed and i got gradually worse but had reguallary check ups with my doc.

&amp;#x200B;

One day i came in and i had taken time to put on make up do my hair and i was in a wery happy mood. People around me comented on how it seemed like things went so much better for me now and i looked so much healtier. I smiled at em and agreed evrything was fine cause at the moment i felt evrything was fine and things was going like it shoud do.

&amp;#x200B;

My doc also comented how good i looked and she was happy to see i did ok.

&amp;#x200B;

I said yes evrything was ok and i felt happy for first time in a long while. she talked a bit and asked what i was going to do during the week and so on normal chit chat. I happily told her i was going icefishing because i got a lifeinsurance now and i had evrything set up and i smiled to her. 

(i was so happy since evrything was ready and i knew what to do. And i honestly thought my toddler was better off with the lifeinsurance then having me.)

&amp;#x200B;

Her face dropped and The wait list to get into mental care suddenly was non existing. Bang i was locked up.

&amp;#x200B;

Here comes my story

&amp;#x200B;

I was scared of people and did not mingle with anyone. i just sat in my bed hiding from the world or out to smoking area to have a cig. That was my days.

Then my birthday came around i was a bit more cheered up with the diea of getting my son for visit and my family coming around.

&amp;#x200B;

Before bedtime i had a couple deliverys. Some flowers from my parents and from my siblings. a smalll card saying they didnt want to bring my son into were it was alot of insane people so they woud not come for my birthday. My sister atleast called to wish me happy birthday before she said they woudnt come either.

&amp;#x200B;

I sat there all alone knowing noone woud bother to come. The flowers went into the trash.

&amp;#x200B;

i spendt the night walking the corridors. smoking and hiding in a corner with my hair as a drape in front of my face so people woudnt see me cry.

&amp;#x200B;

Then this other girl lets call her Annie ,same age as me early 20s sat down next to me. Her hands was red and swollen since she needed wash evrytime she touched something and scrubbed her skin off.

&amp;#x200B;

There i sit a complete mess filthy and smelling since i had stopped washing/combing to make people awoid me and leave me in peace since i was scared of them.I wasnt even human it felt. She stoke my back and asked in the mildest voice ever what was wrong since i was silently crying and hiding.

&amp;#x200B;

 The fact that Annie herself was germophobic and sat there stroking me in my state was just unreal.Her compation with a fellow human overcame her fear of germs. Something that realy shows what kind of warmhearted person she was. The compation broke me and i bursted out with how my family woudnt even come and evryone had called the day before my birthday and how i missed my son and noone cared.

&amp;#x200B;

Annie herself was a patient but managed cam me down and even talk. calmer i went to my room after she returned to hers. and i sat there sulking feeling sorry for myself. I needed something to do so i went to kicthen asking if i coud help make food (since it was diffrent task we was allowed to help with to break the monotomi) i was brushed off with no the group was full and they coudnt fit me in since there was enough. I then asked if i coud go walk with the outgoing group but also got told no they was full. There was rules on how many patients on each group due to number of carers.

&amp;#x200B;

Dinner came along and i had gone hiding in my room crying for myself and sulking. i didnt want to go for dinner and refused to move. My carer then came in and ordered me to come or he woud carry me. He looked at me and told me

&amp;#x200B;

I can promise you that people will look at you more if i carry you then if you walk by yourself.

&amp;#x200B;

i dragged myself out of bed and we walked into the dining hall. When we opened the door all the patients and staff stood there cheering and started sing happy birthday. Annie had told the staff what had happend. so Annie had gone with the group that was in kitchen and made a birthday cake for me,the outgoing group had bought a present that they all had chipped in for. I stood there frozen before i started cry. That was the most memorable birthday ever. And it shows that people who is down on their luck actually are warmer and more caring then many others.

&amp;#x200B;

Annie and i got out of there and  became good friends. She was  like a godsent Angel for me. In a weird way we connected and actually helped eachother to heal more then the place we was did.

&amp;#x200B;

It took time but in the end we bouth managed get over our fears And are now funcionable people. It shows that no matter how dark it is there is always a ray of light if you look for it. Annie was my light and probably the best person i coud met.

354,"So little bit of background, I just turned 17 and this girl is almost 16 we had known each other for about a year and a half before this. I have struggled with MDD for about 4 or 5 years now. 

Anyway, this girl and I used to have lunch together everyday for a year and a half before our schedules got changed and we had different lunch hours so we saw each other less. After that, she realized I was in an art class while she was in her lunch hour so everyday she came to see me. She was going through a semi abusive-is break up and had slipped into a depressive state for a couple months because her previous boyfriend blamed her for making him feel so alone. Naturally, I comforted her through it and we talked about how she was feeling everyday. 

We got really close. Soon, a school dance came up and we decided to go together. It was an amazing Friday night. We did things teenagers did together at dances. After the night was over, we both went home and I didn't hear from her all weekend. I'll admit at this point because of how close we were, I started developing feelings for her... And it seemed like she did for me as well based on the night of the dance.

Monday came around and when I got to our every morning hang out spot at my school, she was with another guy... They seemed almost as close as me as her did but instead of getting a hug from her like I did everyday, she seemed to interested in him to even notice me.

She still came everyday at lunch to my art class but she brought that guy with her every time. But something was different... She no longer talked to me. It was like all of our interactions ended faster than I could snap my fingers. This continued for a long time before finally she stopped coming. (it is important to know that this guy was not her boyfriend)

I made it my goal to find one of her classes and try to talk to her when passing period came. When she came out, she looked at me and asked me ""since when do you walk this way?"" then saw that the same guy was walking the other direction down the hall and immediately left me before I could say anything.

After this happened, it all just went to sh*t. I started having freaking reaccuring dreams replaying that memory over and over again. (I still do)
Words cannot describe how much I was hurting. I felt abandoned and alone... Not to mention that her friends that I was also ""friends"" with stopped talking to me as well.

At this point I was clean from Self Harm for 3 months but I got to such a low point that I started again... It wasn't as many times but I was definitely deeper.

Now in the present, she still doesn't talk to me and hasn't for a while. I just don't know how to move on though. It's like every time I have a dream it involves her in some way... Or me badly harming myself. ",0
355,"Second post on here.

I’m not sure what I’m experiencing could be called depression. It’s more like utter emptiness. 

Stuff feels meaningless. Just activities I do out of habit or to get some kind of temporary pleasure. I’m walking through life like a robot. There’s no long term purpose in what I do. 

I don’t know what’s going to happen to me. I’m not even suicidal. I’m just empty. No motivation. 

Have I gotten too far into my own mind? I’m a pretty smart person. 

Is this some sort of liberation which I don’t know how to handle? Sometimes I feel the curtains have been pulled back and I can see life as it really is, i.e., a biological game spiced with humanity’s crazy mental constructs. 

I don’t know. Any feedback? 

P.S. I’m not taking any kind of medication or drug and I haven’t been diagnosed with any mental disorders. ",0
356,"Has anyone else been finding that over time that they're less sad and more so angry? Don't get me wrong, I definitely still feel empty and sad, but it feels like where I once felt sad about a lot of things I now feel resentment and anger. It doesn't matter if I'm thinking about the world, the people who I feel have ""wronged me"" or even myself - my initial response is always fury. I'm not sure if this is just part of the path to recovery or if it's a result of pent up frustration with no way to express it, but it doesn't feel healthy. In some ways, it feels liberating to not be crippled by everlasting sadness but I'm not really sure how much better this is. I haven't consciously acted upon my angry thoughts, but I feel extremely petty for simply having them and holding grudges. I've tried my best to prevent it from affecting my day to day life but sometimes when I listen to what I say or read my messages it feels really off-key and strange. Despite feeling ""wronged"" or my brain deciding to cast blame upon others, I really don't want to become toxic or verbally lash out at someone. How do you guys release this type of anger?

I can’t talk to anyone about this, because all anyone will ever tell me is that I’m being “lazy” or that this is just part of “adult life”. Well if this is what being an adult is like, I want absolutely nothing to do with it. The most infuriating part is that there is no escape. Within 1 year, I’ve gone from being a careless teenager, to an adult with a car payment, rent, pg&amp;e, and whatever else the fuck I have to pay for to “survive”.... none of that seems worth it at all if this is how I have to feel to achieve it. The saddest part is I have the easiest job in the world. Great environment, great co-workers, great managers, I get to sit in my car for 80% of the day, and I make good money for what I do. But none of that matters when I don’t WANT to be doing it. It sucks because I’m self aware of the fact that it’s just my toxic mentality that’s causing this.. but I can’t break out of it. I’ve had 4 different jobs in the past year and every single one has made me feel this way. So I know it’s not the job I do. I just hate having to work. I just hate the idea of committing myself to the monotony of doing the same thing everyday just to make another person more rich. I can’t take it anymore... the more I do this the more I fantasize about death.. it’s honestly the only thing that gets me through my days now.. is telling myself that it’ll all end soon. It feels like there’s no solution here. Either I quit, and lose everything I’ve worked towards, and be forced to move back in with one of my parents (who both have no grasp on mental health, and have stated they would not at all be supportive if that happened). Or I keep slaving away and lose grip over my mind slowly and slowly until I fall off of the deep end. I just don’t know what to do. I feel so guilty that I feel this way too, because I was raised under the ideology that people that don’t want to work are “bad people” and only want to use the system to benefit themselves. I don’t feel that’s what I am.. but to my parents that’s what I am. So I just have to put on a fake face and tell them that “yup everything is going good, just working and gettin though life.” And the moment I start talking about work, it’s like I’m suddenly on the same level with them again, and they have respect for me. Why is it that when you’re employed you automatically gain respect? I think that’s such a terrible mentality..

Sorry I feel like I kinda went off topic with my rant.

Anyways I just needed to type out my feelings to get my mind off the fact that I’m about to go want to die for the next 8 hours.. and then do the same thing again, and again, and again.

Not really sure if I’m looking for “advice” as I don’t think there’s really an answer here. I’m either going to quit and ruin the life I’ve started building for myself, or eventually kill myself from the amount of agony, sadness, anger, and all negative emotions that having to work is causing me.

I have “dreams” and things I want to accomplish, but we as a society aren’t aloud to focus on such “silly” things. Because if I work, all motivation I have to do the things I want to do dissipates immediately. I used to use my time so good, and try to achieve as much as I can throughout my days. Now anytime I’m not working, I either want to sleep, or do nothing at all. Nothing brings me joy, knowing that I have to do this bullshit everyday. I wish I could feel joy again. The closet thing I get to joy is the comfort of sleep. At least I don’t have to think about work while I’m asleep.

Anyways, time to go fantasize about death for the next 8 hours.

362,The only friend that I have at work left already and I feel so alone. I'm so out of place and I feel so alone. I'm so scared. I want to cry right now I don't know what to do. I hate myself for being like this. I hate myself so much. ,0
363,"I've gone through a rough past few months, with losing two friends who did me dirty (like dirty dirty, one fucked the other when we didn't know each other but never told me while the other was trying to get at me 24/7 and knew i had feelings for them) this really messed me up mentally for a month or two, and I still can't believe that happened but I'm ok now. This happened at the end of the last semester, and I pretty much came into this semester with no friends, just my sister (thank god) since she really was a rock for me during this time. I had some ""friends"" or more so acquitances that were involved in a club on campus, and these two girls were really nice and I wanted to be friends with them, and decided to try to join their club. I thankfully went through an interview and go accepted in! That was seriously the best decision I made this year since it has made me meet some really good and nice people who share similar interests with me. I feel like I belong to something now, which is something I've never really felt. I was hesitant to join the club since I was just so down and already dealing with my depression and all this personal life stuff just got in the way. But my sister really pushed me to join the club and to try and see if I like it. And I'm so happy I did. I really hope I can make some good friends and be more active on campus and less isolated, alone and depressed. I know many of us on here are depressed and can't really see the light at the end of the tunnel. But If I have any advice it would be to try to step out of your comfort zone. And understand that your depression is sort of this damaging self-destructive cycle, but we have to be the ones to break this cycle. Maybe join a club on campus that is related to your major or something your interested in, or join something where you can be more social and be around others. I just hope that I can continue to better my life and not let any issues or people bring me down. Cause I know I really could have closed off this semester from what I experienced before, but I really just want to be happy and healthy. Thanks for listening :)",0

366,"First time poster here, I've been reading for a while though. I've recently been diagnosed with severe social anxiety disorder and no medication has taken me out of my downwards spiral of anxiety and depression. It's been maybe four years, I only managed to reach out a year or two again and I feel like I haven't moved at all. I used to be a straight A student, but now I'm lucky if I get a D in any class. Life just seems pointless I guess.

&amp;#x200B;

I guess the thing that's been on my mind most often is the impact I'm going to leave on the world... It's been 18 years and I have impacted no one or nothing; and I don't see myself impacting anything in the future either. Life just feels like a pointless slog towards death, and I can't move that along quicker without impacting people. It feels like a limbo, I've accepted my pointlessness and that I mean nothing, and at this point I just want to be forgotten. It's weird because I always have this nagging in my head that I am taking up too much space and impacting everyone negatively, probably the S.A.D. whoops, and I don't want to be that way. Interacting makes me want to die, and doing nothing also makes me want to die badly. I guess I don't know what to do, at this point I want to just stop trying with medication and therapy and just accept my fate (although accepting that will probably only make all of this worse). I feel like a fool really. The world will always continue to be the shitty place I was born into, and I can make it better for no one being I am just a weight holding everyone's heads underwater. I just want to cut the chains and drift off until no one recalls me. 

&amp;#x200B;

I have a problem with depression and anxiety but mainly addiction. I am heavy addicted to Xanax (I've been cutting down), but every now and then then you'll see me fucked up on alcohol or xans. Okay? I know my fault.

Now I woke up an hour ago at 1am after drinking more than a half bottle of vodka and some sleeping pills and seeing a fucking letter that my aunt said to go back to my mother. Fuck. You.

Alright. I get fucked up often but HAVE THEY EVER TRIED TO GET TO KNOW WHAT THE FUCK I FEEL AND WHAT GOES ON IN MY BRAIN OR WHAT MAKES ME GET FUCKED UP? NO AND GUESS WHAT. IT'S THEM AND THE SITUATIONS WITH THEM. 

I know they tried to help. I know they brought me to psychiatrists, psychologists and all that bullshit but it doesn't help at all. I just do it for the scripts. 

Now my mother and father want to move to another place where I won't go no matter what.

My aunt and her family is also religious af and they say they got fucking ""rules"". Aunt also got depression but she can't understand how addiction works. She just can't. It's simple.

So now I'm stuck. I'm 16yo. In between 2 houses that I feel trapped, unable to do anything, and my only thought is about ending it all as soon as possible.

377,"I had been having on and off episodes where I just suddenly lose interest to do things. One morning I have all planned out, coffee in the machine, workout and office clothes laid out, to-do lists all set and plans for the day made - all done the night before. I woke up the next day and I just am tired. I don't feel like doing anything, leave things half-way done and find it extremely difficult to get basic things done. I have been lately thinking (almost all the time) about my life, achievements and feel like I have failed. I am not able to find anything worth looking forward to. I masturbate regularly, often mindlessly. I just do it without thinking much. In the office, I just want to go home and sleep (lie in bed) and want the day to be over.

I am 35m, dad of a 4 yr old and has a good job which pays well. There are some quirks associated with the job but overall it comes without many hassles. I am not able to learn anything new. I haven't taken any initiatives for a long time. I am technically strong (or used to be) but haven't done anything noteworthy in the last 1.5 years (before that I used to be the rock-star in my team). I have plenty of ideas, but I am not able to move. Recently there have been complaints about my performance. This helplessness kind of dulls me further and this forms some sort of a vicious cycle. These days I am scared when a simple request shows up at my desk to be worked on.

Almost the same on the social front as well. Absolutely no friends, no one to talk to. My daughter and wife are in my home country and they are among the larger familial circles and are cared for. What stumps me is that I am not able to get excited about my daughter's achievements (she sang this new song, she made this drawing, etc). I don't feel like going back to my family (and country) because I am afraid they would ask me how much money I have made, or what plans I have for future, etc (i don't have answers to these). I wish I could go back to my mom, hug her tight and never leave her. (My eyes are fucking watery and I am in office now).Dad turned out to be some sort of a monster (tried to have sex with my wife) and we no longer talk to him. Mom decided to be with him, refused to accept his faults. Bit of soup there as well.

I workout, lost a lot of weight but it just keeps coming back. I have massive cravings like all I want to eat is just cake. Different kinds of cakes. For lunch, dinner, and breakfast. Working out excites me usually, I plan and prepare in advance for that. I spent a lot of money on athletic clothes, all kinds of supplements and powders. Some days, all that excitement just dies down. I find me in my bed, staring at the ceiling when my alarm goes off in the morning. Once I hit the gym, I can continue for the next few days constantly. I eat clean and well during that time as well.

I had me tested for depression about four months back and the doc said everything's all right, it was just a lack of sleep. I tried sleeping well but I am not sure if that has made any difference. I smoke weed almost every day. Have been on that for a year now. I had not mentioned this to the doc.

My major issues are indecisiveness, memory loss (forgot my wife's bday even though I know her DOB very well) which affects people around me. Also, extreme laziness or not able to get anything done. Am I crazy? Am I depressed? Seeking medical help is out of the question for me unless I am pretty sure about it.

PS: I started writing this post during noontime, I was on the verge of emotional breakdown. At some point, I thought office folks would see me crying out loud. Now its end of the day here, I am a normal guy. Completed some work, ate some food and talked to a couple of folks.

382,"So I'm coming here for a bit of advice and to hopefully get some questions answered. I apologise for this being so long. 

My girlfriend of 9 months broke up with me last week. All her life she's struggled with depression but in the time I knew her, she was quite good at managing it. For the first 8 months it was great, she always told me that she loved me and she wanted to do stuff with me, she'd get excited to see me and she always talk about wanting to spend her life with me and have kids with me. 

The beginning of march is where it changed, she told me that she'd been struggling with her depression for a couple of days and that she was being sad all the time because of it,  Over the few weeks she became more and more distant and didn't talk to me as much. She just didn't seem herself anymore. 

She broke up with me last week. She said that she can't focus on the relationship right now and she feels like she's responsible for my happiness and she can't deal with that pressure right now. Another thing she said is that she doesn't feel like she's good enough and she thinks i deserve better than her. Which is not true at all. She kept saying that she still loves me and thinks the world of me and that she still wants me around and she hopes we can remain ""at least friends"". A couple of days after we spoke little and I asked if she still loves me and she said yes, then I asked if she sees a future for us and she said she doesn't think so.

So the reason I'm posting this here is to hopefully get some questions answered and hopefully get a better idea of how she's feeling right now, since I've never suffered with depression myself so I don't completely understand how she is right now.

- Is there anything I can do to help her?
- how can I better understand what she's going through
- could I be right about her trying to push me away because she thinks it's what's best for me
- is there any chance we could get back together after this

I'm just so confused about the whole situation right now, all I know is that I love her so fucking much and I don't wanna be with anyone else, and that she's in a pretty bad place right now.

396,"It's a weird funk isn't? You beat yourself and crave intimate connection with people, doesn't even have to be romantically either. Just a real genuine connection with someone that you could just relax around. You know have deadlines coming up and you stress about it yet your body does nothing when your brain is screaming that you'll regret it or maybe losing points is what you deserve anyway. And the scariest part is knowing that you just don't give a shit anymore if you're really honest with yourself and it sucks because you want to but it's just not there. No spark, no flame, no drive.

You look around at people and really try to understand how they do it. How they can become so close to people cuz clearly you forgot. You wonder how they have so much drive and you end up getting frustratingly jealous but it's more of a  sorrowful feeling if anything. 

I'll have days when I'm more optimistic, maybe my playlist is playing all the right songs and maybe there wasn't as much small talk. But then there are days when you just can't help but over think about how maybe the best relationships you'll have have already been made and your self destructive behavior is getting harder to control. From when you wake up that day till the end of the week sometimes. 

I don't want to call it depression cuz I feel privileged. I've made amazing friends, I'm just not now and feel more lonely than ever. I feel easy to forget and those relationships are probably going to fade away with time eventually.  My procrastination isn't a real problem, I'm just lazy.

These little things are just things I have to work on. Easy fix. I don't need professional help or counseling cuz then I'd be taking away time from someone who needs it more than me.

It's aight, I don't really care, but she did it after he treated her like an incel - long story short, he annoyed her by trying to sleep with her, she didn't want, he stopped talking to her, and ""to make things right"" she just slept with him and they sorted it out and fine now.

I asked her ""so you just did it when he was incely towords you?""
""Yeah who cares""
""Alright if you say so..."".

Point is: It's fine.
I don't care, she always shares this and we share almost everything.

But for my point: why am I always getting similar things like an insult to me?
Like a statement to ""you're toleratable, but I, or anybody else, will never see anything more in you, you're just there"".

Why am I thinking like this?
What's wrong with me?

I have been dealing with depression for a year now and most days I just lay in the floor and cry. It started effecting my sleeping schedule. I either sleep 3hrs, 10hrs or none at all. I have told my closest friends about my dysfunctional self but while 3 of them care and try to help and support me, the other 3 do not get it. The other day one of them cam up to me and said, ""what's going on? You look depressed or something"". Why can't they get it? After that I spent an hour or so crying but yeah.
This post may look dumb but I needed to vent so I'm sorry. Also, I need a hug ",0
399,"Everyone who I've talked to about my depression says it gets better, but when? It's been 3 years since I tried to off myself and I don't even know how long I was depressed for before that. I just want it to end. I don't feel like I'm progressing, everyone's talking about uni applications but I don't know if Im even gonna be alive then.",0
400,"I got know where else to go to vent about this. I’ve already bothered my close friends about this too much and I’ve told my parents about it but they have enough to worry about and I just end up feeling like I’m burdening them. 

I’ve been dealing with depression since I was about 14 I’m almost 20 now. Nothing ever triggered it for me it just kind of crept up on me. Random feelings of complete sadness and thinking no one actually liked me. I grew up in a big family with older siblings so naturally they use to pick on me all the time. I thought they were just toughening me up but I don’t know if that had anything to do with my problems today.

Couple years later Im 16 and I get a girlfriend towards the start of my junior year in high school things were great for a few months but I always had that doubt in the back of my mind like I always do. I might sound like an asshole here but I eventually just got bored of her it just didn’t really seem like a deep meaningful relationship and it just got so repetitive doing the same things all the time never having any deep meaningful conversations or anything. Could have 
just been my fault but I don’t know. that lasted for about a year until I told her I wanted a break and we ended up breaking up shortly after that. 

After we broke up I was even more depressed and things started looking really dark for me. Ended up finishing high school a year early and was just working. I met this girl on this dating app and we were talking for awhile and decided to meet up. Everything seemed great and everything went really well she said how much she liked me and cared about me and all that shit. Couple days later it’s Valentine’s Day. I’m stuck at work and I get a text from her mother telling me her daughter wasn’t allowed to date anyone and she thought I went out with her on Valentine’s Day but I didn’t go anywhere with her. Turns out she was talking to this other guy . I tried talking to her about it afterwards but she never talked to me after that and ended up blocking me for no reason. I felt worthless wondering what I did wrong or what I could’ve done differently. 

After that I’ve stayed completely single going on a couple dates here and there but they never really went anywhere. I decided that if I really wanted to have a meaningful relationship I had a lot of things I needed to work on myself. 

My first semester of college I was getting pretty behind in everything and I procrastinated everything I could and started getting behind in all my classes and In the middle of the semester one of my best friends got into a car accident and was killed. Completely failed that semester and ended up falling into the worst depression in my life. I just became numb to everything started drinking a lot and smoking way too much weed everything just seemed so dark and pointless. Life seemed like a big joke to me and honestly it still does. I thought moving out of my parents house and getting my own apartment would make me happy but it didn’t. I just ended up smoking more weed every day and just kept to myself most of the time lying in bed all day mindlessly scrolling through the internet. 

That’s where I am today I’m still at the same apartment and no matter how much I try to get myself out of this depression nothing seems to work. I’ve tried a bunch of different supplements supposed to help with depression but nothing seems to work. I’ve tried adjusting my diet and exercise more but I just end up getting even more pissed off. I tried going back to college but the same thing happened as last semester I started off strong but in the end I just ended up not doing enough of my homework and skipping class too much and ended up failing again. I’m just so fucking sick of everything. None of my hobbies seem to interest me anymore and I feel like I’m living the same hell day over and over again and I just can’t fucking take it anymore. I’m not suicidal at all because I just couldn’t bring myself to do that to my family but I’d be lying if I said I didn’t think about it all the time. It just gets really hard especially at night being left alone with my thoughts I have insomnia and it doesn’t matter if I get up early and I’m active all day I’ll still lie there in bed trying to fall asleep until the sun comes up. I’m just so sick of living this meaningless life. If I can’t be happy now why would it matter how successful I am I still don’t think it could make a difference. And it’s not like I don’t have friends I hangout with them every week but it just feels like a distraction from depression. It’s easy to put on a big smile in front of everyone else smiling cause if you don’t people will constantly ask what’s wrong but it’s just too hard to explain it to people. I’m just rambling at this point but I just can’t find a good reason to go on other than for my family. I owe them that. But I can’t find a reason for myself. I have no motivation and everything just seems pointless to me. I just want to feel that same joy I did as a kid when I didn’t have this dark cloud following me wherever I went

401,"For the better part of 5 years now, I have constantly been dealing with what I would call a mild form of depression. I say this because I have never been tested for it, and consequently I don't take anything for it. It pretty much boils down to some days I feel ok, some days I feel down. It's gotten to the point that out of the week, I feel down at least 5 days out of the 7, the other 2 just being ""all right"". Some days I wake up feeling fine, only to think about something or get told something, and then it goes down from there, or I wake up already feeling down and this carries on for the rest of the day. I think that this mainly has to do with the fact that I don't find a point in my own personal life. I don't have any passions that scream out at me, anything I can really be useful or good at, so, I don't find a point in my life. I have already graduated from university and this has only gone and worsened my bouts of ""mild depression"". At least while I was a student I could have that to distract me, but searching for a job while others are constantly telling me to get a job and bringing it up any time they see me not applying for something, it makes me feel like I can't do anything anymore without having my sense of self questioned. I'm just really in a difficult time in my life, when it comes to self appreciation and pushing myself to do things, seeing as how anything I try in order to find what I am passionate or good at turns out to not be successful.

411,"Basically the title.  

My depression was diagnosed in 2015, but I'm pretty sure I've had it since at least 2013 or 2014, and I've pretty much always been able to carry out basic daily functions, with a few exceptions here and there.  It got so great to the point where I even stopped taking my antidepressant in 2017 (very bad move), though I'm back on it now (and doing a lot better), but I honestly don't think people would be able to quickly figure out I'm depressed unless I tell them.

I have several friends who aren't as fortunate as I am, and their depression is so bad that it causes them to skip school/work, not do homework, even drop college classes. For example, I'm one of the leaders of a student organization that these particular friends are part of, and we have mandatory attendance at certain events; these people have skipped out on mandatory events with depression as an excuse.  Honest to God, I wish I could do that, but I know I have a commitment to this organization and show up anyway.  As someone who has high-functioning depression, this is something I understand but can't quite wrap my head around, since I'm lucky enough to at least have enough motivation to be able to drag myself out of bed in the morning.  For lack of better words, I guess I've gotten pretty good at being able to shove depression to the back of my mind for a couple of hours depending on the situation.

I want to support my friends and help them deal with their depression, especially since I'm in the same boat, but I don't know how to do it without coming off as holier-than-thou.  How do I support my severely depressed friends while still encouraging them to complete activities and fulfill duties?

I think my breathing got heavier the more I held it, because by the time I sat back on my bed, I was breathing VERY heavily and very shortly as well, and began to shake and cry. I was aware of it as it was happening and I wanted to stop, but I felt like I couldn't control it. I also felt very tingly/trembly, like I was going to pass out or something.

I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder and paranoia, my doctor gave me lithium (300 mg) about 5 days ago and now I feel bad.

420,"So, I was wondering what is your opinion when it comes to living healthily during a mental illness.

I've been struggling with depression from October to January, now it's gotten better. I still have depressive mood on occasion, and am still struggling with the anxiety. Anxiety in my case has this feature, that I often get this shortage of breath, when I think about things I'm anxious about. This shortages can make me really unmotivated to do anything, it's like I'm losing the will to live. After something like this happens, length of my lack of motivation can vary from 15 minutes to a whole week.

Now the problem is, I eat and live like shit. I'm currently studying, so I buy myself the cheapest food for the most of the time. Frozen pizzas, toasts, hot dogs and shit like this. I rarely visit the gym too (even though it's in my dorm for free). The thing is, taking into account of what I plan to do in the future (I'd like to become a commercial pilot), I should change this. I WANT to change this. The problem is that when I start changing my habits, I tend to stop because a day happens, when I feel like shit due to my mental state. After a day like this, all progress is lost.

Do you think it's possible to maintain a healthy lifestyle during a mental illness? Or do you think that it's a lost cause, and I should focus on my mental health first? Did you struggle with this too?",0
421,"I feel totally lost.  I am a 41 year old male struggling with life.  I grew up in a sheltered Air Force family where I was more shy than sheltered so I did not really do any coming out of my shell until after high school.  My parents literally wanted me to go party and experience life.  And I did!  Had a scholarship to a local community college which I screwed off because of partying.  My parents basically threw money at me so I never learned the value of money.  You know you hear about people who grew up poor and turned out to be millionaires? I am the opposite.  Struggling from paycheck to paycheck.  

I started working at a young age at a dialup internet service provider (before the internet) and did very well doing technical support and also selling T1 (ISDN, T’s) lines.  Company got bought out by another huge ISP and your favorite cell phone company.  Since then I have been doing various jobs in the company, mostly phone based.  I am an introvert (ISTP-T) and have a hard time making small talk which we are forced to do.  Making human connection.  Well you know cell phones have large issues with idiots and outsourced overseas agents working for them messing things up.  So the bright folks like myself have to clean up the work.  And get bitched out by angry customers in the process, which I take personally.  Pays well and I have been here for so long that I only have 8 years til I can retire.  Going for my bachelors in business management/mis, which I only have about 12 to 15 hours left. 

I have always been a very intelligent person who can do anything he puts his mind to but it’s hard to prove to people because you talk over their head.  Most companies want degrees to get good jobs and even then you are not guaranteed so feel like giving up on school.  I am more of an entrepreneur and do not really like authority.  Not in an unlawful sort of way.  My issue is self confidence and drive.  I feel like the beaten wife who keeps going back to her husband.  That is what my job feels like.  But it pays the bills and don’t have the self confidence and drive to find something better because of the possibility of rejection.

Married to my wife for 8 years.  No kids even tho we want one but trying to time it right.  Money, school and such.  My main dream in life is to do something with cars.  Race, fix, build things like that.  I love German and Italian cars.  I have a doctor friend who has several Porsche’s and Ferrari’s who lets me drive them but I want one of my own to race and become a professional.  You know they say you can be anything you want to be? I don’t believe in that.  So much so I have given up in my dreams.  Oh your too old for that.  You will never have the money to do that.  My wife wants children and I do too but I am scared out of my mind not having enough money when I am elderly and also resenting the fact that I might not have gotten the chance to follow my dream because of money issues.  

Anti depressants are not working like they have been.  Taking testosterone shots to help with low t.  Feel like I am out of options.  Feel like I do not want to be on earth but also at the same time I fear god and hell so I would never do anything so I feel sort of stuck.  Sort of being in a glass bowl looking out at the world wishing I was one of the ones successful.  And yes, I do believe wealth is a sign of success.  People that say it isn’t is saying it to make you feel better about your situation.  If you cannot pay your bills and live comfortably, then you will be stressed and depressed.  ",0

I  mean how does anybody live with fact that everybody who they care about  can leave them at any second? How does anybody live with all this chaos  in the world? In today's society, we are essentially pitted against  each other in the grand colosseum of capitalism, where we're tossed  around by our circumstances, constantly being broken down by each other.  I mean like at the end of the day, we're all just looking out for  ourselves, and that idea makes me feel so fucking lonely, that we're  going to have to screw over and be screwed over by people who we do and  are supposed to be able to trust, people we care about.

How does anybody live in this cruel world. There is no good, and at the end of the day, we're all going to die.

Think of the person who you care about the most. Think about how much that person means to you.

Now  think about how one day, you're going to talk to them for the last  time, you're going to see them for the last time, and that'll be it. And  when that happens, you'll either feel nothing, because they no longer  mean what they used to mean to you, or you'll feel extremely guilty that  you hurt them like a fucking psychopath, or they'll have just died for  whatever reason the universe has decided, and you'll have suddenly lost  them permanently.

Nothing that is good lasts forever. The only thing that is certain is that one day, we all die. And you know what, I'm ready.

Take me.

I'm  going to wake up tomorrow morning, and feel completely fine, and then  slowly crash throughout the day. Every day feels like a spiral  downwards, a free fall, but with random jerks left and right. I'll start  out like a normal person, and slowly go insane, and repeat that for the  rest of my life.

So I’m sixteen and this is it. 
So I’ve been dealing with a lot of shit the last year of my life. I started feeling sad for no reason and then every possible way I was fucked over. 

I watched a man die in a motorbike accident and was the first on his body, and I tried to keep him alive for 30+ minutes before an ambulance arrived. 

My cousin who I grew up with and loved, who was two years older than me died in a car accident barely two weeks from the motorbike accident and I then had to speak at his funeral and deal with the death of someone I loved. 

Then I watched my grandfather have his own tractor roll on top of him and kill him. And I had to comfort my entire family, especially my dad who all could not handle the death. And had to speak at his funeral as well. 

I have a fucked leg and have been on crutches for 1.5 years all up. And the day after my grandfather died I had to have another surgery. And it keeps me from doing everything, which then makes me even more depressed. 

And now I am in one of the worse places I’ve ever been in my life. My parent have just split as well. And I struggle to get over 4 hours sleep. Every time i stare at the darkness of my room I remember the bodies of the people I have watched die, moments with my cousin, my parents, and how much of a fuck up I am now. And I can’t deal. I want to die. But I know I can’t. I can’t do it to my family and friends. Especially after all they have been through. 

And I have just spoken to a friend about going to see a doctor behind my parents back ( I’m too scared to tell them, and I can’t put them through it) about getting anti depressants or counselling. But I’m sketchy about anti depressants as they were the supposed cause of my other grandfathers suicide. But I don’t know what do to. I can’t keep living like this.

429,"I've struggled with depression, anxiety, ADHD for years now. For awhile it was something I just lived with. I had expected my situation and never did anything to help myself, the only times I had reached out before did not work and set me off counciling for years. Now a 20 year old first year college student I found myself doing poorly and struggling on the day to day. Things changed when I asked one of my professors for an option out of our in class participation mark due to my crippling social anxiety. He said that I should make an appointment with a Counciler and ended up walking me down there because he knew I wouldn't on my own. Fast forward a few sessions and I'm not doing better but it's a start, me at the beginning of the year never would have done anything like this, I've been making appointments with others at the school to figure out how to fix the situation I've started by doing so poorly in school due to depression, lack of motivation, anxiety, and ADHD which I have gotten a prescription renewed for the first time in years. I got registered at a local mental health focused clinic in town and will see my gp next week to discuss medication options and will follow up at the other clinic if need be. I've taken a couple of mental health days to sort out basic needs like a hair cut and getting myself running shoes to stop being inactive. I've aloud myself to be vulnerable infront of my counciler and a social worker at the clinic which is something I don't ever do, mind you I didn't cry I just wept but again it's a start. I've still been depressed and on edge, even more so than usual the last couple days as this has been happening, as well it's still hard to get up in the morning and I still can't stand the whole time I'm in the shower but now I put on deodorant  and make sure my teeth are brushed well. Again it's a start. I've been a nervous wreck but I'm trying, and I'm so thankful for the professionals from my professor to everyone who is working to help me. before I started writing this I didn't think I had done anything but now I have tears in my eyes realizing how hard this journey has been and how much harder it will get, but things will get better, I just have to fight, and fight I will.",0

435,"I spoke to the head coaches older brother just now. (Aril 3, 2019 10-11pm)  


Let's give names to these coaches.  
rapist: R  
Head coach: H

Brother of Head Coach: B

Let's go back in the past a little bit.

B was there for me when I confronted R. B was on my side. He was really disappointed in my rapist since R was a coach too. B asked me what I wanted to do. If I wanted my rapist to be fired. I couldn't give a straight answer but this is in line of what I said that day:

""I want him to get fired but at the same time I know what H is going through. I know that R is the only full time coach and if he got fired, it would ruin H since we don't have that many coaches. So I can't let that happen. I just want to confront R about what he did and hopefully owns up to what he did.""  


But R replied with anger:  
""I didn't do anything. You wanted this. You were flirting with me. I have the texts to prove that.""  


So I replied:  
""I have the text where you begged me not to tell the coaches because you said that 'it will ruin you. please, the gym is my life.' I can go to the cops about this, but I can't let my parents find out. I can't make them worry about this. And I don't want to be responsible of ruining peoples lives.""  


He completely shut down and changed demeanor when I told him I still had that text. I think B realized who was telling the truth in that moment. But in fact, I lost that text due to a need to reboot my phone so that my dad could use it. I no longer have evidence.  


Now back to the present:  


B heard from H's gf about what I told her so he texted me saying ""I thought that whatever happened to you and R was over""  


So I replied:  
""It's not. Mentally and emotionally it's not. I pretend that everything is fine but it's not. I don't go to the gym anymore because he's there. I thought I would be fine but I'm not. I thought I could forget it but I can't. I keep seeing his face in my head and I keep reliving those days.""  


So he tells me to not go to the gym anymore. So I will stop feeling the way I feel. So the drama could be over.  


I felt betrayed. I felt alone. I felt like he was protecting him just because they're best friends. So I argued that it's not about how I can't work out, its about the fact that he gets to live normally, while I cried every night, while I contemplated about taking my life every night, while I still relive those dark times. While he goes back to the life he lived like nothing ever happened.   


I felt like I was an inconvenience to them. That I'm not worth any action.

&amp;#x200B;

It's been hard keeping myself away from that gym since everyone there were the first friends I've ever made since I moved here. They were my second family. But I guess I wasn't to them.  


""Just stay away from the gym from now on.""   


Fine. I'll start my revenge from afar. Nothing bad I promise. But because of this, I'm too scared to go to other gyms in fear that this will happen again. I'll figure out how to build my own MMA gym. A better one. One that's not full of rusty equipment and minds. One with professionals you can trust. One where we put our customers safety above what we lack. One that everyone can trust.   


So I guess this is where the saying ""when a door closes, another one opens"" comes in.   


But in all honesty, how hard is it to find another coach to replace another? You can search while R is still coaching then fire him as soon as you found another right? I think I'm becoming bitter now, I'll stop.  


So yeah, what better way to come after a business than to become or make a better one.   


At the same time... it'll only bring me temporary joy. My revenge plan no longer seems worth the effort. I'm sorry.",0

437,"How does one go about this? Is it simply a matter of going to my doctor and suggesting a start on them, or is there more involved that I'm not considering? I've done my research on my family and what has worked historically for them, as well as consulted trusted family members in pharmaceuticals for where to start and such. 

I feel like this is the time for me to start. I have followed self help books on nutrition, exercise, and diet. I've even been to visit a cognitive behavioral therapist throughout the past year approximately, and I'm still not getting out of this dark fog to the degree I feel is necessary to continue.

438,"I'm sure there's a reason for this and I'm just unsure of it. But basically up until February of this year, I felt like absolute garbage. I was sad, lazy, tired all the time, anxious, unmotivated, and had suicidal thoughts often. I couldn't think good thoughts about myself or my life. I couldn't feel confident or thankful for anything. I spent much of my time thinking about killing myself. I did not set goals or work to make changes in my life because I figured I would die young anyway. Through some type of fucking miracle, I started working out recently. Nothing crazy, just hikes and very basic workouts at the gym. Right after I started, I got this sudden jolt of energy and calmness. I felt so good. I felt clearheaded, confident, happy, motivated, and excited for things to come for the first time in years. I have no idea why this happened. I found myself not wanting to die anymore. Now I've kind of lost that. I don't feel anywhere close to as good as I felt for a few weeks but I don't feel anywhere close to how bad I used to feel. I kind of don't feel anything at all. I just want to know if anyone else has had similar experiences. It's scary to feel numb.

440,"I'm 18 now. I've suffered with depression since I was a fairly young child. The worst of it being when I was 14-16. I had three suicide attempts and had generally given up on life. After the last attempt I decided that I was gonna try harder to get better for my moms sake. And I did and eventually it stopped being about her and started being about me being actually happy. I got off my medications and started going to therapy once a month rather than once a week. 

I've been very sick the last few months. My digestive system hasn't been working right and I haven't had a chance to go to the doctor because I'm always working. I've gained a lot of weight in the past two months and I've developed consistent acne which I've never dealt with to this extent. I used to struggle with an eating disorder and I still struggle with body image issues. So this has just made my self esteem plummet. 

It's taken a toll on my relationship. My boyfriend gets frustrated with how distant I am and although he doesn't blame me for it, I haven't had much of a sex drive lately and I know that's somewhat difficult for him as well. He tries really hard to get out of the house and do stuff and get frustrated when I don't really want to but it's so hard just to find the energy to get out of bed. I almost ended the relationship because of how much I hate myself right now. Which I don't want to do, but I feel like I've caused so much damage that it'll never be the same. 

I've been super irritable. Everything sets me off and I have a hard time controlling my anger. I don't mean to take it out on the people around me. I know it's my fault. But I still get angry at them. 

I've been doing so good for years now that with me being at such a low point, I have no clue how to handle it anymore. I'm so tired all the time. It's a chore just trying to wake up. I've been trying to keep a happy face as much as I can for the people around me but that's so draining as well. I feel suicidal, and although I know that I won't actually take action on that, it's so hard to find motivation when you feel that way. I hate myself and I just feel worse when I end up hurting the people I love because of it. ",0
441,"Hey guys.   

I've been taking lexapro now for a few months and I've been regularly going to therapy. Also I've been going to the gym and hanging out with my friends alot more, rather than just staying in my room playing overwatch. But I think the medication made the biggest difference. I feel completely different.   

I am in college and the past two semesters have been rough. I thought I was just stupid or lazy or whatever. I couldnt remember things well, I couldn't focus very well.  

Now thats completely different. It feels like my brain was surrounded by a mist and the meds cleared it. I remember things clearly. I get my work done, I can just sit down, say I gotta do this assignment, and I can usually do a respectable amount of work right there.  

My mind is all of a sudden incredibly sharp. I am so creative and witty and I love it. I was already witty/funny (not trying to brag but its one of my features im pretty confident in) but now its on a completely different level, I surprise myself with the things I come up with sometimes. Today someone said I was the funniest person they ever met (which makes me feel so good) And as for creativity, I can come up with solutions to problems in classes or in my clubs, and they are actually good ideas often.

Its been so long since I've felt this way. Today I was talking to my friends a little bit about it, and they say they've noticed the change as well. Now, I pressed them about it because I wasn't sure if they were just saying that to make me feel better. But they convinced me. I asked how they could tell and they said two things: I smile a lot more. And its something in my eye. One friend said they are just more vibrant.  

&amp;#x200B;

I  just feel generally more confident. I'm looking people in the eye when I walk, not just staring at my feet. I can talk to strangers without worrying so much about it. I can make mistakes without them jumbling around in my head all week. I'm not focusing on my flaws all the time, and the flaws I do recognize just dont seem that big a deal (which is insane because I used to obsess ALOT)  

&amp;#x200B;

  

&amp;#x200B;

Now I have a question for anyone whos been through a similar situation: How do I stay this way? Because I was near this level of content before a while ago and lost it, but now I feel really really good (probably better than ever) and I dont want to lose it. Please  give me advice/tips, I really cant go back to how I felt before.",0
442,"I've struggled with severe depression for about a year (I have dealt with depression throughout my life), and it's been worse and more frequent than before in my life. I've been to therapy and recently I've been feeling as if I'm on the verge of turning it back around. 

I think the main barrier for me right now is communicating with my partner. 

When I am alone, I feel encouraged and hopeful, but as soon as I get home, I fall back into the cycle. I don't tell her about the hope I felt. I know she would love to hear I have been feeling better, but  I feel emotionally paralyzed and I don't know how to communicate it to her. Because of that, my hope dissipates at home and I feel like everything goes back to ""normal"".

Somewhere in my head, there's a wall I've built between her and I. I think it was originally meant to protect her from the darker parts of my depression, but I am concerned now it is preventing me from communicating the positive things also. I need to begin disassembling this wall.

443,"This is a lesson that I have had to learn the hard way. It doesn’t matter from who or from what, but you can’t be stuck in the middle or you’ll drown. Depression can make you feel horrible in all sorts of incomprehensible ways, and it’s even worse when you want to try and break out of that rut because you want those feelings gone asap, but that is not how it works. Life is hard, and not just for those of us that have mental illness. We make mistakes. We experience heartbreak and tragedy. But you can’t stay in the middle when you realize that you’re feeling this way. We need to try harder than most to move forward, even if our progress isn’t always tangible or we don’t feel better right away. I have been in this place before, and I found a way to move forward with less than what I have now, so as much as this sucks I know that it is possible. And I know that it is possible for all of you as well. You have to will yourself to move on from those who are toxic, who don’t care about you, who can’t have you on their lives, or whatever the case may be. It can be very hard depending on who that person is to you, but it must be done. Life will not wait for you. Those people will not wait for you. And the middle will consume you while you wait to start swimming. Like I said, I am right now here with you, but I know that we can all do this. We will not just die. ",0

Well, first of all, there is a huge difference between being depressed and having depression. If you don’t understand it, you whole article is going to be rubbish, naturally.

453,"TL;DR: I had some suicidal thoughts, and over a week later my therapist sections me - despite the treatment plan we had in place, and knowing how much i've been trying (successfully) to get through it. I now have no therapist, no partial program, and a lot of anger at the whole mental health system. 

Two weeks ago, I was having a pretty rough time. Previously, a med change had left me so sleepy I could barely get to classes, so in addition to struggling to get my work done I was falling behind. I had a plan, though - I'd worked with my teachers to get back on track, I was in therapy, and I had a new job lined up. I thought I was in my last rough patch, and even though I'd have to do a lot of work to get through the semester, I felt like I could do it. 

Enter my ex. Though we'd split up almost 6 months ago, we still talked from time to time. He was the only person I knew in my city, and when I needed help I'd turn to him. I thought he was such a nice person for agreeing to help me -- though eventually he'd do something to remind me why we split up. He came over two weeks ago, and we stayed up late watching netflix. 

I woke up to him pulling my hand down his pants, with my own leggings half-off. 

I was disgusted - with him and with myself. Worse, I knew I'd lost my only friend. 

So I decided I was done with it all. I made plans, and the next day I thought I would go through with them. I didn't, obviously. I called my mom, and we drove back home. I knew I couldn't go back to school and guarantee that I'd be safe, so we started looking at a medical leave of absence. 

A week later, I'd seen my meds person and my therapist. We'd decided that a partial program would be a good next step for me, and it would help with securing the leave of absence. I had a place, and I was due to start Monday. 

Cut to last Saturday -- and this is where shit really starts going down. 

My mom comes in to talk to me, says that she has spoken to my therapist. Although I don't remember giving my therapist permission to talk to her, they spoke about me. My mom had her own concerns about me, and shared them with my therapist.

This was over a week after I was at that low point, and I was doing pretty well, relatively. The new meds were starting to work, and I wasn't having many side effects. 

It's important to note that hospital has always been traumatic for me. After my last inpatient stay I've had to deal with panic attacks any time I think about what it'd be like to go back there. There's no fucking chance I'm ever going inpatient again, and that fear was partly what led me to call my mom before things got even worse, and what made me accept that I need to go on leave from school. I was even struggling with the decision to go to a partial program, but I wanted to get better and give my family some peace of mind, so I'd accepted that it was a good next step for me. 

But apparently this desire to get better and get the most out of a partial program wasn't enough for my crazy therapist. Two hours after she called my mom, she called again to say that she was sectioning me, and that an ambulance would be at my house soon to take me to ER. 

I'm angry beyond belief at this point. I've been to the ER before for this sort of thing, and I know what a long, impossible process it can be. My mom knows how much panic hospitals create for me - she was there last time I was inpatient, when I was under 18. 

I know I have to keep my shit together if I'm going to stay out of an inpatient program, though, so I push the anger away until I can get home. 

I'm in the ER for SIX HOURS, wearing flimsy scrubs and watched by a security guard, before I get to see a social worker. Luckily, she's a rational person, and she agrees that my therapist was out of line to section me, especially since we had a treatment plan set up and I'd been safe throughout everything. I get home from the hospital, cry for a few hours, and finally fall asleep around 3 am. I was supposed to work the opening shift at my job, but apparently my therapist doesn't care about how working makes me feel better, and thought my situation was so dire I'd kill myself if I wasn't inpatient - despite seeing me earlier in the week, going on about getting out of negative feedback loops, and me expressing the desire to get better. (I'm still in shit with my boss about missing that shift - thanks for starting another loop, asshole!) 

I sleep, cry, and seethe throughout most of Sunday. I console myself with the knowledge that the partial program will at least get me a therapist close to home, and that my therapist can't do any more damage to my recovery now. 

On Monday morning I wake up to a phone call from the partial program I was supposed to start later that day, and they say that they can no longer take me, since my ex-therapist has told them I need to be inpatient. I try to explain that I was evaluated at the ER and they agreed a partial program was appropriate, but apparently they have some protocol that means they can't take me with my therapist's note on file. 

So now I have no therapist and no partial program. I've called around and it looks like I might be able to get into some programs next week, but honestly I don't fucking want to go. I don't even want another therapist. I'm so hurt that someone I thought I could trust, someone who was supposed to be looking out for me, could fuck everything up based on the worries of an overprotective mother, despite me trying my absolute best to get out of this fucking pit of depression I've found myself in. I tried so fucking hard, reddit, and I'm in a worse position now than when I started. It's harder to keep the thoughts away, too. I don't have anyone in my life that I trust anymore. 

To top it all off, I need to spend hours on the phone chasing down leads for a new partial program or a new therapist who can see me twice a week, because if I don't I won't be able to go on medical leave. I'm so exhausted, angry, and sad. I just wanted to get better - why is it so hard? I thought having a therapist was supposed to help me deal with having suicidal thoughts, not try to force me inpatient. I don't know what to do anymore.

I feel like my depression has become a huge burden to my family and partner. I’m terrified of what will happen when I can longer even do my job and support myself. 

I’m starting to think a lot about death and dying and how maybe I’m just not meant to be alive. How maybe it will be better if I was dead that living as this shell of a person. 

TLDR: my treatment resistant depression is ruining my career and relationships. I don’t know if there’s a point to living anymore. ",0
455,"Please help.

I had a shitty day and cried at school, which actually for once led to me to being in a counsellor's office, and for some reason I actually told them I thought I was depressed.

I really fucked up. Now my parents know and my mother's arranged an appointment with a GP. And I'm still doubting if I'm actually depressed. I think I probably am (constantly tired/miserable, can't go one day without thinking about suicide, randomly crying, not being able to interact properly with people) but I still might not be.

I want antidepressants but I don't think the GP will give them to me, since I have no idea how to 'prove' I'm depressed or how to even describe it. I'm also 15 and it'll probably be blamed on teenage angst.

I really need advice.",0

i wish i knew what happened. what made me lose grip on school. i've lost my memory, my reasoning, my logic, all of the things that i held to such high esteem. now, though, that's all gone, and i don't have anything i excel at anymore. i don't have anything that i can use to help me. i don't have anything at all, really. no real friends, no real family, no real support. sure, i see people at school, and i talk to people around 5 times a week, but i can't really open up to them. i have a mom, dad, brother, and sister, but they don't care about me. in fact, all of them except my sister despise me. i have a school counselor, but i'm petrified of going to them considering i have no idea who they even are.

459,"I've had depression and social anxiety most of my life but since maybe around 6 or 7 months ago, it actually affected my life because my best friend said really hurtful things to me that made me feel like the most horrible person in the world. I removed her from my life because I had enough of the negativity and I had enough. At first, I felt like a bad person for letting her go especially with her circumstance. Right now, it finally felt the right thing to do.

I'm having a hard time moving on since I still ""hear"" her words she had said to me in the past as well as other traumas. 

Recently, 3 months ago, I decided it's time for me to become a better person again and I had analyzed on what kind of person I want to be and made goals. Currently, I have no friends, never been in a relationship before, graduating from college soon, not able to find a job, planning to get into graduate program after a gap year. 

The biggest frustration is...I'm barely making progress with achieving my goal. I just don't have the energy. Everyday, it's like...
""Okay! I'm gonna be that kind of person I want to be today. I will smile and say hi to many people I know! I'll make friends in no time"" 

*walks out the door*

""sigh...I'm tired...everyone hates me, I wanna go home. Everyone is looking at their phones forgetting I exist. Everyone thinks I'm lazy""

I lose my motivation the moment I go out of my home. I'm still figuring out what is holding me back.

Is there any tip or advice that help you to make progress in your goal rather the process is short or long?",0

461,"I’m so tired guys. 

I’m tired of being boring. 

I don’t have any real friends anymore. The ones I do/did have always seem so bored when they talk to me. They sigh, or give me this look like “get on with it.” 
My ex-best friend is, for some odd reason, just outright easier to talk to. Easier to chit chat, laugh and have fun with. We’ll be standing next to each other, and friends we both know very well will talk to her over me, then look at me and say, 

“oh hey, Shibeyu. How long have you been here?”

The whole time, is the answer.

I try to mold into a person like her. 
I try to make the same jokes, do the same things, 

But everyone looks at me like I’m the odd one. She does them, and everyone basically claps and applauds. Laughing. 

It’s so obvious when another friend of ours is with her. 
He won’t speak to me when I’m alone, without her, despite us knowing each other for the past 8 years. But when she’s around? A whole new him. This may sound like he likes her, but, if that’s the case, alright. I’m happy for you. 

Next, my boyfriend. 
God I love him. He’s helped me and cared for me since the day we got together. 
We used to talk everyday, almost every hour he could, but now, he’s reduced to “mmhm” or sometimes, I just catch him not even listening to me. 
“What? Sorry.”
It really hurts. Coming out of a bad relationship where my ex would just flat out never talk to me was painful.

My parents even.
They seem like even they’re bored with me.

All of this makes me feel just boring and dull.

Like a little gray dot among this sea of colorful people, with their online friends, or the ones that walk beside them. Just absolutely nothing interesting about me. 

Nothing in my life that’s interesting.

Personality is blank. I feel like I mold a new one for each person I mean. 

My art is boring. Nothing astonishing, nothing that lingers in your mind long after you saw it. 

My looks are boring. Brown hair, blue eyes. Dull, pale skin.

I feel just...

Boring. 

It’s eating away at me and I don’t know what to do or what to feel.

Can I fix myself? Can I make myself exciting?? Can I make myself interesting?

463,"Life is hard. People are so consumed by their lives that they don't have time for other humans. I deactivated my Facebook to exercise, but in a selfish way, I want them to either miss me or move on. Sometimes my friends are not good enough for me.

464,"I used to hate life. I used to cry every day. I used to want to die.

2019 came and I got a new job, only working 3 days a week making the same as my other jobs where I had to work every day.

Working makes me depressed.

So this job helped, I had a lot of free time. I liked another job where I worked 4 days. It was 2 days, day off, 2 days, then the weekend. It helped me so much. This one is good like that.

People act like I have it easy, and yeah I do. I love my job, thats why I am happy now. I felt joy again. I went out and plays pokemon go, I cought a bunch of pokemon. I do battles and raids. It makes me so happy. But it hurts that everyone had to bag on me constantly. I make the same money as before, so this... isn't a bad thing. I'm going to talk and see if I can get more hours, I want 4 days instead of 3.

I stopped crying every day. I was happy. I felt good.

But... things changed.

Everyone is on me about it. I can't complain to people because they all make fun of me for working only 3 days. I never complain about working too much, just... like how annoying a customer was, or how rude the manager is.

I don't cry. I don't hate life. I don't want to die. I feel it in the back of my head. I don't want to die, but I am going to kill myself. I don't hate life, but I don't want this life and I hope it doesn't last long. I dont cry but i feel the anxiety.

Every day I count down the days to go back to work. I feel anxious.

The days used to go by fast and I loved it.

The days go by fast now and I hate it. Longer days please. More time to lay in bed please. Please.

It doesn't hurt anymore to live. I just don't want to live anymore.

Recently my buddy drove me home and decided to hang out with me instead of going back to go to dinner with our buddies.

He doesn't know but I was going to hurt myself. I was going to try to kill myself. And he insisted on staying. Maybe he knew? I've changed recently. Everyone's seen it.

I used to do whatever, whatever someone said I did it. Then suddenly I enjoyed hanging out with everyone, even suggesting things or places to go. Then I started shutting myself in. I didn't want to go out. I had to be home and get ready for work the next day. I would slightly hang out on non work days, but dont count on the day before work again.

And it annoys them. My buddy sat on the couch with me and told me I was going ro hang out with them the next day so be prepared. Having that day to prepare helped. I didn't kill myself that night. I went to dinner with them the next day. I had a good time. I made it through the day.

It doesn't hurt anymore, and I'm making it one day at a time, but it's hard. I feel like it should hurt, but I can't feel the pain.",0
465,"For the last couple of month I have tried everything in my power to deal with my depression I have had since I was 15 years old, I am in my 20s now. In 2014 I finally made progress and got my self an education, I was so proud of my self, then in 2015 I was almost raped by a guy who beat me up and left me unconcious on the floor in my hallway with a broken pinky and ripped clothes because I didn't want to sleep with him and just like that, all progress went down the drain. I was placed in a mental institution for month and month, I don't remember how long it was, time is a blur to me. 

I fought it and got better, and then I entered into an internship at a nursing home to ease my self slowly and safely back out to the world, and after a few month of me being a stable individual, I vitnessed the most wicked and evil thing I have ever seen, a superior worker who worked at night with me, told a different worker not to react on a fever that an elderly person had and to let that person die becuase they needed to make room for a new person due to a long list of applications. She saw me in the door and told me if I told anyone she would destroy my life, then she left. I got an anxiety attack and almost passed out, I cried and called the one resposible for the nursing home and told her everything and quit. Got into a mental institution once again. 

No matter what I have done, I've been smacked down and that is okay, some people just can't live and I am one of those. People always say, ''shit happens'' or ''get over it'', really? Is this what I am fighting for? Is this the life I shouldn't take for granted and have to take care of? As if I am about to lose a great deal of happiness coming my way at some random point in my life with no garantie? sigh...

There is nothing I want from life at this point, and I don't think being depressed is the wrong thing, but rather that people who are depressed have seen what life is and cry for what they wanted it to be due to all the bs you get taught growing up, ''you can be anything, you can do anything, people are good at the core'', no, no and no. 

People are careless, thourghtless and destructive.

Most will disagree with me and that's fine, but know this, I have sat next to a dying woman on christmas eve and held her hand as her sons wouldn't come and say goodbye to her because they were to busy, and they asked me, ''can't you just call when it's over with?''. Just writing this here makes my stomach ache.

I've come to understand that humanity is flawed beyond repair and I want nothing to do with it. There is now no goal on my horizon, my parents and boyfriend suffers due to my descend into darkness for the fact that I accept it fully and I can't claw my way out this time and I won't.

I have robbed my parents of the experience of being parents with a little happy family as I have been different and sad always. I can never forgive my self for that and I won't ever try to, I deserve this guilt. 

There is no getting out on the otherside, there is no green grass for me, is that my own fault? Probably, but I don't see how you can find a happy place in your mind unless you neglect everything real and become a mindless individual, and I can't do that.   
I have seen the worst in people and I have felt evil being acted out on me for no reason other than personal gain.

I do not seek empathy nor any cheering on, I just needed an outlet as I have been silent for all of these years and I don't know if I get to say anything to people I care about as I am mute when asked about anything about me. This is my safety if I decide to go, so people who know me and care for me have a chance to find this and understand how life is through my eyes and maybe then they will be able to accept it better.

473," Hey guys. I was suffering from depression for a while (like 2 years) and I struggled a lot everyday to battle against it without medicines and treatment, but it was kind of impossible to fight it alone. I didn't have a happy day for a looooong time, but now I'm free and I'm so, so, sooo much happier.
 Over a week ago my wife decided to go away and left me alone in our house because she didn't love me anymore. I was a depressed guy that was unhappy everyday and she couldn't handle it. We weren't happy. 
 We didn't talk since then and suddenly, on the third day that she left, I felt happy again. After a long, long time I just felt something again!       
 Sometimes we can't see what is causing our depression and we think it's just our brain or that is our fault on something.
All I can say is that I'm finally free and happy. I couldn't see it was my marriage that was so toxic and causing it. Actually, I knew it was, but I didn't want to see.
 I started to reconnect with all of my GOOD friends and now I see I have quite a lot of them that I wasn't talking to, because my wife was so possessive. I'm going out everyday, well dressed now, not like a homeless like I was doing before. 
I even went to a party on sunday and kissed a girl there. I was so confident and started to talk with her and we suddenly started kissing.
 I'm running one hour a day on the threadmill and eating less and better. I'm working more and I'm not playing any videogames. I'm just a new man.

tldr: I'm better in every aspect of my life after my marriage came to an end. That was the cause of my depression and I couldn't see it. I wish you guys can get better and feel happy again, like I am.

I went, and it didn’t really help at all, all he did was recommend therapy and a counselor to talk to. I went in there wanting to try medication for depression since just overall talking to people about my problems don’t really help long term for me. So, My mother called a few places around here to get me set up with someone and they all said it would be at least 2 months, I was very sad that I couldn’t talk to someone and things just kept getting worse and worse. Fast forward, it’s been that 2 months and my mom never made a appointment like I thought she did. Me and her were talking and she said something like how about I just bring you to the hospital because me and her were arguing , I wasn’t against that and then she said she wouldn’t bring me. Now, she made an appt with her doctor office for me to go , and I went to the dr there, and he prescribed me sertraline (Zoloft). This was Monday, so I’m on day 2 of taking it. I can only take 25 mg for 6 days so I can get use to it then I go to 50. Is there a certain time frame I can notice any changes and actually see if it works?

480,Now I know a lot of people don’t seem to think ghosting is a big deal so let me just give some context as to why it’s so important to me. I’ve had  anxiety since I was a child. In my recent years it’s become even worse for me. Throughout high school I didn’t even talk to anyone or approach anyone therefore I had no friends. The very few friends I did make we just grew apart and some I just had falling outs with. Some even ghosted me. About a year ago I made a friend on Xbox. At first we just played games but then we started texting every day and played pretty much every day as well. We would watch movies on Netflix and talk in a party together. We talked for hours and hours. I made it clear to them I had anxiety and that’s why it was a struggle for me to talk to them and they understood that. Throughout our friendship both of us would come to eachother to vent because neither of us had many friends. Also we texted constantly as well. Most people would consider us “clingy” but it was fine with eachother. He would text me every day and I would text him everyday as well.The last time he texted me I didn’t even notice at first because towards the end of our friendship I had been busy trying to get things going in my career but I still texted him everyday even if it was a few texts. Then I noticed the last text he sent me sounded like he was going to attempt suicide. I tried to contact him because I was worried something had happened. The last text he messaged me made me worry because he had mentioned to me that he had tried suicide attempts in the past. They also unfriended everyone on Xbox so it wasn’t just me he was singling out or so I thought. A day ago I found out I was blocked because I was on my friends account and looked up his account to see if he had posted or anything and noticed he was on and still had other people friended. I instantly knew that he ghosted me. I’ve had so many thoughts as to why. Maybe I was clingy but he texted me just as much and if I didn’t text for 1 day he’d say he missed me. Maybe it was because I had a lot of issues and therefore vented a lot to him. But he also vented to me constantly and whenever I would vent he would make it about himself. I constantly supported him and reassured him everything was ok and he was a great person. Maybe something happened in his life and doesn’t feel like talking to anyone. But he’s still talking to other Xbox friends. Maybe it was because he liked me more than a friend but knew I didn’t want to be anything more than friends because he would compliment me and I would compliment him as well and he would also draw me and I don’t mean 1 or 2 drawings but much more. We also had pet names for eachother. Regardless of the reason now I will never know. I’m hurt that he blocked me when throughout our friendship he would beg me to never block him even if I didn’t want to talk to him anymore. And now I’m left without any closure and the only friend I had left is gone. I’m still shocked because we reassured eachother we would be friends for a long time because we both had trust issues from friends in the past. I’m deeply hurt now and I don’t know what to do. I don’t want to try contacting through another Xbox account to ask why because I feel that would be wrong. But I’m lost and I want closure. And because he blocked me I will leave my last words to him here: I understand if you never wanna talk to me again. I accept that. I’m just glad I had your friendship even if it was for a short time. I want you to know that you were a great friend. And one day I hope that you talk to me again and give me a reason as to why you ghosted me. You knew how hurt I was at getting ghosted in the past. You knew I had anxiety and other issues and especially trust issues. Please. I just want to know why. ,0

This is the only place I can turn now... other than my piano, I have nothing and no one to confide in.",0
485,"I have decided to come onto reddit because I am sick of nobody helping, understanding or listening. I really would like some advice and reasons from you kind souls, i just want to know why i feel this way, and why so much damage exists in me, so if you could help that would be amazing. ill provide some context. I am a 20 year old British Pakistani girl living in the UK. I grew up in a very broken home, witnessing domestic violence and countless arguments between my parents, as well as a bullying older sister and acting as a referee and go-fer between my parents’ marriage for the duration of my life. My mother was emotionally distant and had manic depression for the duration of my childhood and my dad was bad with his temper at times too. For some strange reason all my life, since I was 6,7 the only thing i have dreamt of having a boy love me. having a boy make me feel special, having a boy marry me and give me this normal beautiful life. Alongside this, in terms of the love thing, I’ve been in love three times. And every boy I fell for has never ever  felt the same way back. i have always been the “piece on the side” and the other girl, and have been taken advantage of my whole life. I always get rejected because of how i look, or who i am. i absolutely despise myself. This is because I always settle for being the side piece, I know they only want me for sex and also, money. but i feel like that’s some form of attention, in some way. I recently came out of a very messy friends with benefit situation, where he was not only using me for sex for 3 years, but for money. i come from a wealthy family and offered my support when he needed it, and he abused that in the worst way, but for all i knew, i was just trying to buy his love. I loved him like I never loved anybody, he gave me physical attention, I lost my virginity to him, he swore blind he cared about me for 3 years and he had just been lying about everything all along. i tried to buy his love because i don't have anything else to offer, clearly I don't. I don't have any boys running after me, ever, nobody has ever shown an interest in me or made me feel special, not even my own parents. I don't have anything to offer except money, and lets face it, that is attractive. I have always been “the fat girl”, i was 8lbs when I was born, so i honestly always have been like this its my body, its not out of unhealthy eating or poor lifestyle. I am a size 22 clothing and my body is honestly disgusting, and I know thats a reflection of the fact that I no man has ever felt the same love for me I have them, always been unrequited. I hate myself, my body, but even more, who i am. Im so loud, and annoying, and get attached so quick. Im so desperate for attention, for people to think im this amazing person, so i put on this I used to say when I was 16, 17 years old to my friends that i don't see whats so good about me that someone would want to marry me. i hated myself when i was 16 and i was petrified that when the time came to marry, i wouldn't have anyone. Im now 20, and for those saying i am still young, im really not. My mum (being of pakistani decent) says she wants me to get married by the age of 24,25 and i agree. i would love to get married now and have a boy love me and give me the life iv always dreamed of. im so desperate to be loved guys, i can't sit at weddings knowing that will never be me, i can't scroll through girls getting their bridal makeup done on instagram, i block any happy couples i see. I don't see anyone falling for me ever. they haven't in 20 years and i don't see myself changing in the next year, so why would someone come. i have had this fear since i was 15 and now the day is coming so close. The last boy i loved was the only person who really knew me, and vice versa, and i wanted to marry him so much. He knew me inside and out, saw the real disgusting me and left. I don't see why anyone would want a fat, ugly, disgusting personalities ike myself, which is why every boy iv gone for has never ever felt the way back. Guys don't like fat girls. i am joining the gym but that can't change my personality which seems to deter everyone away. i have tried counselling but it never works, they just say oh you are young you'll meet someone. but it had to be now, im already late. for me it takes years to get to know someone id marry, years. if i met someone now we could get married for 23/24, my dream would be complete. any one iv met in the past iv always showed them with gifts, money, and favours, and thats the only thing that defined our relationships. They used me. But money and gifts are the only thing i have to offer, i have nothing else but i have that. so i use that to try and get them to love me, i thought if they see how good my heart is when i give them money and spoil them, they will love me back. I do suffer from depression since I was 15 now and Have had PTSD since I was 14, when I witnessed my mum try and knife my dad, and herself. Iv got no friends, never had a boyfriend, hate myself and can't see marriage happening, i need to meet someone now so i can have my perfect life, i don't feel like i would have any depression or anxiety or problems period if someone loved me, every bit of emptiness in my life would just be gone. Why am i like this guys? please someone offer me some advice or practicalities. thank you x",0

I have now been thinking about this, and I am starting to believe I was only doing it for the attention. I have these episodes, and I show symptoms of depression. I never tried to intentionally use my mood and emotions to manipulate or deceive anyone else though. I have done harm to myself. I have genuinely thought to myself how much of a failure I was. And the list goes on. These mood swings do happen when certain conditions are met, and these episodes last for at least 2 weeks. In general, I am not really happy with myself with anything. I even go out of my way to talk crap about myself, even if my friends tell me I am a good person. And I have not put any faith in myself, or even care about myself. I have told others I do not care about myself, and it would remain that way, no matter what they said.

489,"## Part 1: The Reason People End Their Life (Plus Part 2: How to Save Yourself)

## The Reason Why People End Their Life

I know what it’s like to feel that ending it is the natural next step. How f’d up is that? That thinking suicide is the next step? Like it makes sense to end it. That moment is what prompted me to reach out and talk to someone. But not everyone has that insight when they’re that deep in the dark, murky little hole we label as “depression”. Like a cave that lures you in. slowly. Making you think that following it into the darkness is the way to go.

I’ve heard people say that suicide is selfish. But having been close to that edge, I’ll tell you right now, people who are contemplating death aren’t thinking on a level where emotions or standard logic even really apply. We’re just thinking, how do I get out of this hole? What’s the next step? And the darkness is what answers. It’s sinister. Like a siren calling sailors to the sea. So it isn’t really a choice that we make. You can call them selfish, but people don’t just one day become depressed and then boom. They’ve taken their life. Like “screw you, family, and friends”. No. They’re impaired. It takes months, if not years, of feeling as though you’re up to your knees in mud, surrounded by a thick, sound-absorbent fog, 24/7. So it takes a while. And by that time, their mind and emotions are just a tangled, unrecognizable web. So it’s not that they don’t care. It’s just that nothing is rational at that point.

Other times, ya, it can be more sudden. like a person just isn’t equipped to handle stress at all. things might compile quickly and then instead of looking for an exit at the front or back, they take the ejection hatch instead, because the front and back doors still have more problems. Do you see what I mean? But chronic depression? That’s more debilitating. Because it's every single day. And life never stops. They aren't given time to navigate or process what's hurt them. And if a number of things happen before being able to heal from the last insult, it becomes cumulative. It snowballs. So if you ever see someone who strikes you as though they might be struggling, just show them love. Compliments work great. Even from a stranger. Something as simple as holding a door open and smiling at them can be all it takes. Or if it's a friend or family member, just get off their back and interact with them from the heart. Just love. I mean don’t assume they’re thinking of taking their own life, but everyone appreciates a random thoughtful gesture so there’s no harm in a gesture, even if you’re not right about it. But if by chance they are struggling, it's those small, seemingly insignificant gestures that can be all it takes to remind them that hey. there is a light. here it is. and it’s in the opposite direction the darkness is coaxing them. Even if that light appears dim to them at the time, now it’s there. It makes them remember there's another path behind them. They heard your call, albeit muffled. But That's the pivotal point right there.

Most people don’t just pop out of it. It took them a while to get there so it’s going to take a while to get them back out. And it is going to take a ton of effort for them to trudge all the way back. so turning back around has to seem worth it, because they’ve used up all their energy for so long already. they’re depleted. So you need to trickle charge them. One day at a time. gentle persistence.

It’s when people never experience an interjection of light, the people who forgot there even was another path, that’s when they do it. They continue into the darkness. And to them, it just makes sense. Because they’re welcomed by the dark. It’s inviting. and it feels right. good, almost. So they follow it.

After the comments I received on the first post (posted yesterday, and identical to what's written above), I just wanted to add a Part 2 because of how dark the nature of that post was. I reposted the original (above) but added this second part so I could change the title of the main post to hopefully reach more people. Please stay with me.

&amp;#x200B;

PART 2:

**How You Can Save Your Own Life**

&amp;#x200B;

This part is dedicated to whoever reads this, or is going through this. introspection and self care is what brought me back to a place of calm.

&amp;#x200B;

All of the problems we feel are impacting our mental health are exogenous, meaning they come from outside of us. Once you realize that YOU are a separate entity, you are your OWN entity, the circumstances are severed from you. You realize there's a difference between you and what's happened. You are NOT your circumstances. Circumstances are their own thing. YOU are NOT them. So don't become them. Don't let them trick you into thinking they are you. Start doing things that you simply enjoy, just for the sake of pure enjoyment. If it's sleeping, stop feeling guilty for sleeping and tell yourself, I like this. I am sleeping because I enjoy it. Not because it's an escape. Use little activities to build rungs of a ladder to lift you back out of the pit. And remind yourself you're doing them for the simple fact that they calm you, and you are enjoying them. Whatever they are. And find things about yourself that you like. Stare into the mirror if you have to. That person right there? They're all you've got in life. Don't let them down.

Other people can contribute to your pain, or your healing, But it's up to you to realize that happiness is a choice, and you are being an asshole to yourself. You gotta quit being an asshole to yourself. Tell yourself that. Look into the mirror and tell the dark and mean part of yourself that is tearing you down that they're a fkn jerk and that they're wrong. That you deserve happiness and you're sick of the shit you're feeding yourself. You deserve MORE. you deserve everything. put your foot down. Being an asshole to yourself obviously isn't doing shit for your life. Let's see what being happy can do. Why not? You've got nothing to lose. Lift your eyes up from the sidewalk. If you have to trick yourself into feeling happy and confident, do that. Trick the asshole. Until the authentic you starts appearing naturally. If you see someone happy that you wish you could be like, try pretending like you are happy like them. Act happy like them. Do it for you. And nobody else.

Self care and the following bit are probably the most important thing I could write on this thread. Show yourself some love. Treat yourself as if you were a tiny, fragile puppy. Be gentle, let it breathe, and sniff around. Give it some food. And tell it you love it.

**As crazy as it sounds, negative experiences are not the enemy.**

Do you ever notice how you don't grow from happiness? Sure it's enjoyable, and it feels authentically right, unlike the darkness calling you, which, when i went through that, a part of me still knew it was not sincere. And i know deep down you know it too. But happiness feels the way it does because you've achieved what you were meant to achieve, it's the emotion that tells you you're on the right track. Happiness is the *break* you're *gifted* between life lessons as a way of your higher self telling you ""thanks for listening, here you go. You've unlocked the achievement"". The lessons are served to us in the form of challenges. Like a video game: happiness is the check point. The waves that come at you are like the challenges you have to defeat before you can reach next check point, the next goal you're mean to achieve. What you do in order to get there is what's going to make you stronger.

So personal growth and strength only ever comes from combating negative experiences. They have a purpose, and it's up to you to figure out what you can learn from them. You have to ask yourself what the lesson is. Be curious about it. Stop for a second and apply some thought to it instead of ignoring it. Search for it. Within yourself. Then when you find it, meet it. don't let it bully you. Emotions are a powerful thing.

We NEED negative emotions to tell us what is WRONG in our lives, that we're off our track. They go, ""here, you're going feel a pinch, or a punch even, because this isn't meant for you."" or ""this is close to what you want, but it isn't quite right"". The harder the hit, the more wrong it is, thus, the more you can learn from it, and the more you will grow. Similar to a seed, you *need* darkness to grow. Sounds counterintuitive, but when you think about it, seeds won't sprout without it. They just stay dormant.

But no. You are not a dormant being. What is a seed mean to do? They're meant to grow. And go on to nourish the world around it.

Negative emotions or bad circumstances are the soil. Water is like attention. So if you are a seed, the more attention (water) you give the darkness, the faster you will grow. And then, you'll sprout and reach the sun. Sun is happiness :) Sun is enjoyment :) Sun is calm. and warm. Sun is LIFE. Sun is not found in a cave. or a pit! And a seed isn't meant to sink further and further into the ground. That's not it's purpose. And if you're the seed, it means that sinking isn't your purpose either. Negative emotions are VERY simply YOUR way of telling YOUR SELF that you're off track. That's their purpose. So embrace them. Embrace the dirt, but don't BECOME the dirt. Make the dirt your friend. because without it, you won't grow. So ask yourself what the dirt needs from you instead of seeing it as the enemy. Give it what it needs, and then watch yourself grow.

I had no one to help me out of my hole, no one to tell me these things, but I hope that this thread can be that for you. Please don't stay dormant. Don't keep sinking. This is the light I'm giving to you to remind you of the other path. The path towards the sunlight. Be strong and get through this wave, because the best part about the game is winning. Not defeat. Keep at it. Overcome the waves. Get to the next checkpoint. There is always a next checkpoint.

Why am I 31 and still alone?

I know that this attitude isn’t the answer to my problems but I’m also sitting here in tears just wondering why nothing ever worked out for me.  I know there are those that have less in life than I do, I recognize what I have.  But I also work so hard and I seem to get anywhere.

Goodness I miss the sense of balance. I just man up to carry the consequence of my action. I'm not afraid. There are regrets but I need to move forward.

About myself: Im basically a 16 year old guy, who lived in 4 different countries , 3 different continenets (living in Canada currently) and with no exaggeration, I know something is wrong with me. Started slowly realizing at the age of 14ish that I wasn't really that normal and something was wrong. About my unknown issue (In case I'm lucky enough someone in the profession): It's been two years since again with no exaggeration feel absolutely empty, it's like having a hole in the center of your chest and can't breath properly. Sometimes I have like different personalities, a good and an evil one, music for some reason too affects it somehow. I have no close friends, pretty sure because of how I act or talk. I have thoughts of legitimately becoming big one day out there and sometimes I feel like I would end up failing miserably in life (It's like thoughts in my head, not an actual voice tho). Im not suicidal but I wouldn't mind if I die or someone kills me. What im concerned about rn is that I dont think I can last 2 more years to be 18 and go to a psychiatrist without my parents knowing, like whatever unknown issue I have will become worst. With all due respect I'm not really here to see comments like ""you are not alone"" or ""One day it'll change and be better"" or such. I'm genuinely concerned about my mental state as I'm positive it WILL worsen over time if I didn't get help and if someone could help me answer this question, I will greatly appreciate it.

494,"I can not guarantee my method works for everyone, since we are all different. But why not give a try?

&amp;#x200B;

If I feel tired, then I go to bed sleep with eye mask. However, sometimes though I feel tired, but still can not sleep, then, I use my both hand, touch the bed or the wall, imagine that I am an extension of the bed or the wall, so I have no thought, no thought, no thought, no thought...

&amp;#x200B;

After some time, I feel recovered, then get up, smell the peppermint or lavender oil, the aroma improve my brain activity very fast.

&amp;#x200B;

Then, I do some repeated tasks: For example,

1. cleaning the room
2. ironing the cloths
3. cooking.

...

Anyway, you should do such easy things, which give you a feeling of success after you finished them. You can enjoy the result.

&amp;#x200B;

Don't play a game. Because game need thinking and concentration, but no body activity. After you play the game, there is no feeling of success and proud in your life. You will feel more empty and exhaused, like stopped the drug.

&amp;#x200B;

I think, the reason of the numb state often resulted from over thinking, so the brain is exhausted. Thus you need a balance between the body and mind. That's the reason, why some repeated body tasks without  a lot thing can help you get out of the state. They balance the energy distribution.

&amp;#x200B;

(P.S I don't think, running is always useful for recovery from this numb state, because running doesn't need thinking (it doesn't like cleaning or cooking), so if the brain doesn't have any task, then it will find something to over thinking.  But if you already know how to meditate during jogging, it will be a perfect sport to keep mental health. )

507,"My family always talks about how much of a piece of shit I am. I always hear them talking about me from my room. They say shit like oh he's a lazy piece of shit and they say the only reason I say I'm depressed is because I'm looking for attention. 

I don't have the motivation to do anything anymore, I sit in my room all day and starve myself most day's.

 When they first found out that I hurt myself they yelled at me and said that I was only doing it for attention even though that doesn't make since because I don't even leave my house, and they got mad at me and they started making fun of me for it the next fucking day. (Which they always do). Every time that they find out about something that is genuinely wrong with me they start laughing about it the next day and say I'm faking shit.

 They try to act nice to everyone and put on this charade that they're really nice people, but when everyone is gone they go back to being monsters. They make my little sister cry all the time and they treat her like an actual slave. 

 My aunt that lives with me always treats me like shit and says that I should shut the fuck up and stop telling people that they are horrible people. But it's true!

 Everyone in this house is a fucking horrible person and they mentally fuck with me and I genuinely feel like it's a Stockholm syndrome kind of thing because I feel like I love them when they act nice to me but then they immediately treat me like shit. They are genuinely evil and they remind of demons or snakes.

 I just want to get out of here but there is literally no way for me to leave until I'm 18 and that's 2 years away. I don't think I can wait that long anymore. Everything seems like it's getting darker and I'm being suffocated by the darkness and everyday the light gets further away. It's making me go closer and closer to finally committing suicide. I can't take this mental anguish anymore.",0

509,"So I've had depression and anxiety for a pretty long time, at least the last 10 years (I'm a 21y/o guy) and I've had a lot of medical problems (heart procedure, migraines) that have only made them worse. The awesome thing is that I managed to fight through it all for the past three years and get back to a great college that I really love being at. But now, well, shit has gone downhill pretty fast.

Before Spring Break I was fine, my depression was under control because I was so happy to be back at school and I was fighting my anxiety off decently well. I was barely keeping up with all my work. Going from being sick for three years to a full time student at a really difficult small college has been just brutal. I went home for Spring Break and I don't know what happened, but the second week I was home I felt my depression creeping in and because I'm stubborn, I ignored it. Now I'm at school, extremely depressed, like unable to get out of bed until 5pm and I can barely sit in front of my computer.

Here's the draw back. I'm a musician and I (poorly) do stand up comedy. What does this have to do with my mental health? Well, here's the thing: I am without a doubt my most creative when I am at my lowest points in my mental health. So I don't like medicine because it makes me uncreative which I hate feeling.

I guess I'm just wondering what you guys think I should do to stop this from progressing. I feel pretty helpless and since I haven't been able to do any work, I feel worthless. Do any of you deal with this type of stuff? How do you cope and manage slumps like this? Should I try to do anything or should I just ride it out and deal with the problems once I'm better?",0

My family didnt notice anything at all, i usually try to pretend that nothing happened and im good. Everything i say or write im feeling guilty about it. All these things are so stressful for me.
Sometimes im writing with a female friend, but she has someone and again i feel very fucking guilty about my messages to her. I always apologize to her for what i wrote and she says that its fine but i dont think its true.
Im thinking about suicide for past week or two, but im not sure i can do that and im scared of dying. I dont want to live like that. Most of the time i feel so lonely and i never know if im gonna feel happy or sad, it changes so fast.
Few months ago i didnt think i could change that much. Earlier i was so wholesome, i almost never felt sad or lonely. Often i cant sleep, or i wake up in the middle of night. I dont know, im retarded and im sorry.
Please tell me if i made it all up and its not true.

Yes, I know what helps- sunlight, sticking to a schedule, therapy, exercise, etc. But when my depression is bad, just taking a shower feels impossible. 

These people are well educated in the psych arena- social worker, addiction specialist, etc. but have never recognized that depression is not the same for everyone- and sometimes not  the same for me from one week to the next.

And I’m not a complainer at all. I pull back from everyone when it is particularly bad and then blamed for not staying in touch. It takes so much energy just to appear that I function normally.

I'm 16 years old, student , struggling with depression and anxiety

**Backstory:** 5 years ago, I was happy with my life and everything was awesome. I was quiet good in school, had lots of friends, was very good at soccer(pretty big in germany) and had a good relationship with my parents. I just always was a charismatic guy who everybody liked to hang around with.

But somewhere along the line, I changed.

I dont know when this happened or why, I didn't lose anyone close or got into an accident. There was nothing where you would think, yea thats the reason he changed. Nothing.

&amp;#x200B;

**My story, my life, my failure: I dont know where to start**

Around the time I turned 15, I stopped going to school, I just didn't feel like it. It's not because I didn't like school or I was harassed by others, no everything was normal. But I just didn't have the motivation. Then it started

I found a way to persuade my parents that I was sick very often, I just said I had headaches and was struggling to stand up and stuff, basically nothing you can prove by test or the doctor tell that I'm lying. So here I am, lying to my parents about having some sort of very bad headaches and staying at home maybe 2 days a week. Because my parents both worked at that time, I was home alone and used my time mostly for Netflix or YT. 

Of course, school became harder. I nearly had to re-take the class because my grade weren't good enough, but in the end I did it, but close. Saying to myself, I am not going to continue this shit this school year, I went into this year super motivated. But after 2 weeks maybe, I started again. And it got worse, month by month. My parents, especially my mom did everything to help me, made so many calls and appointments and read books and just tried to help me. But I wasn't sick, so nothing worked which drives her crazy. Like literally, she is so helpless and sad that nothing works. And here I am pretending...

&amp;#x200B;

March 2018 I met my girlfriend. Literally the best person on this planet. I love her. We are in a happy relationship and I really think shes the one. But of course she got involved in all of this too. At first she thought nothing of it and always felt bad for me when I said I wasn't feeling good. But now, after a year of beeing together, she is kinda pissed everytime, because she is somebody that will go to school, regardless of how they feel, and I'm the oposite. 

&amp;#x200B;

I've just made so many mistakes within this one year and I just can't stop making them. I just can't help it. 

So two weeks ago, I got my diagonsis for Depression and some form of social anxiety.

Everything has changed for me that night.

In those two weeks I got to school twice. I don't really talk to my friends anymore, and everybody tells me I've changed. Like do know how hard it is when your parents literally ask you why you are so cold and just not fun anymore and that they want their son back!?

I dont eat anymore, I sleep 12 hours a day, I think about cutting or even suicide.

&amp;#x200B;

In one year I turned my good life into shit. I'm at rock bottom. I don't know what to do or where to start. I dont have the power to get up in the morning. I've let my parents, my girl and myself down and I will never forgive me for this. I could talk about my miserable life more but thats the biggest thing I had to get of my chest. 

Maybe I'll post more details soon. Idk

I have been taking a medication to help fight depression, I want you to know that it works really well, but recently, everything has been going down hill faster and faster and It doesn’t feel like it will slow down any time soon.
I need a place to get my thoughts out. 

I feel like I cannot talk to anyone, I feel stupid, anxious, tired as fuck and can’t keep up. I feel done. 

My wife asked me to open up about it last night and I don’t know how to, I don’t know how to tell her I feel like walking out of work, I feel like the struggle with trying to have a kid is getting too expensive, I feel like I can’t breath I feel like I can’t express any of this through physical words.

I know that in the end, everything will be fine, it always is, it literally always gets better but there are rare times like right now, where it doesn’t feel like it’s fine or it’s going to be “ok”.

519,"Quick context: I'm 20 and I've been depressed since highschool. 2 years sgo I attempted suicide and was put on a mental hospital for a while, I was released a few months later and I've been getting help since, I'm on a lot of medication. 

Ever since I graduated from high school I've felt lost, because there was nothing that I wanted to do, and stepping out of my comfort zone(sleep and videogames, basically) took a tremendous amount of effort. I've felt pressured by society, parents and ultimately myself, to do something that I didn't really want to do: wotk or study. Last year I worked for like 4 months till I could no longer bear it and quit. A few months later I started college, which I'm now still going, however as time goes on the harder it becomes. When I feel bad and I don't wanna go to class, I'm conflicted as if it's just a normal feeling (people wanna skip work/school all the time) or if I'm being influenced by my illness. Should I force myself like ""a normal person would""? Is me blaming it on depression  just looking for excuses to be lazy? Most of the time I don't know how much I can say things are because of my depression or because of my defects that I can't accept I have. Ultimately, whatever the reason, I just don't wanna go. I want to stay in my comfort zone. I don't want to be bothered or face challenges. Can I really go through life like this excusing it on depression?",0
520,"I’ve been losing my friends and can see them actively drifting away from me.

There’s no other group of people I can be friends with without facing ridicule and I care too much about that to just ignore it (so don’t say to just “not care about them”). These have been the closest friends I’ve ever had but now I don’t know what to do. 

I’m sorry if I offend anyone by being a self diagnosed depressive teen but I can’t help it.

My parents are strict, traditional asian parents and criticized me every waking moment for working at that dealership and being a complete failure and disappointment to my family so then I quit and bought a one way ticket to Hawaii and lived with a guy that I had connected with over a dating app. I was at my wits end and already felt like I had hit rock bottom anyway. I ended up staying in Hawaii for 6 months and during this time I aggressively looked for jobs but soon realized the job market there is awful and you certainly need to be well connected in order to find a decent salaried job. That didn't work so I moved back home and lived with a friend for a few months. I worked at a biergarten for free for 5 months before landing a job in DC at an advertising agency. I grinned, worked my a\*\* off and ended up finding a place to live in the city, all was good for a short while for ONCE in my life but then I was ""let go"" from my job after 11 months due to the company ""restructuring"" which I call bullshit but there I was given my severance and now I'm unemployed.

I was scrolling through my LinkedIn just now and saw that my ex boyfriend is now in his country's Forbes 30 under 30 and I just want to shrivel up here and hang myself. After him and I parted ways, he went back to his country and got a job at this small start up but due to their limited capital, they offered him a CEO role and part ownership. Now they have over 1500 clients. This destroyed my entrepreneurial spirit completely and witnessing his success forces me to reflect on myself and what I've reduced myself to. My friends would describe me as someone who would ""always persevere"" but I'm no longer that person anymore. I am lower than dirt, my family doesn't acknowledge me anymore and I'm crumbling in debt – I cannot do this anymore. My friend out in LA is offering to fly me out there but I just don't know anymore. I don't even want human contact at this point. I'm too ashamed at myself for being so broke while all of my friends are making over six figures and going on vacations. I've always worked hard and have been independent since I was young. Interpreting my parents taxes, skipping playdates to help with house chores and assisting with other family matters. My grades weren't stellar throughout my childhood due to verbal and physical abusive parents. I had a hard time investing myself in eduction when I was in fear of my life everyday. After CPS got involved the physical abuse stopped but not verbal. I went to therapy all throughout my adolescent years and then eventually went off to college but my mental health issues were still prominent and it still is today. I have no idea what I should do with my life right now. I am contemplating on hanging myself because I cannot stand the person that I am today and the debt that I am in.",0

So you stay up as late as you can, feeling like shit and full of gross self pity probably trying to distract yourself with something that’s a waste of time anyways before succumbing to exhausting - only to start it all over again.

525,"I’ll preface by saying my depression is rooted in relationships. When I was 13 a formal dance was a round the corner. Leading up to the dance people in class were going over who they were going to the dance with. I didn’t have one so I sat silently and didn’t say anything. 

Unfortunately for me though, a former close friend of mine though became a “popular” kid that year, while I was the one that became bullied in the class. The former friend knew I didn’t have a date, but proceeded to ask EVERY girl in the classroom if they wanted to go to the dance with me. And the responses either ranged from “no” to “ew. God no”. After every girl was done having their moment, the friends proceeded to tell me “CatheterCowb0y, you’ll be lucky if you can ever get a girl”...... 

There were a lot of moments that have made me feel down, but this moment in particular still plays in my head like a favorite movie that I’ve binged multiple times now. I’ve been trying so hard since that day to beat past this thought, but I’ve only been in one real relationship that I stayed in for too long, and since I broke up with the one girl, I’ve only been on one date in 6 months..... and last night a bottom came when I spent $450 on a girl that I didn’t even meet face-to-face. All she did was send photos before asking me to have her uncle access my Verizon account so she could have her “uncle” buy her an iPhone. Once she talked to me more about buying the phone I blocked her, so it’s good to no I have a sliver of self-esteem in me, but the fact I went this far for her I think is a sign I’m not in a good spot with my mental health. I haven’t seen my therapist to talk to about this yet so I feel like this would be a good place to vent/seek comfort right now because after yesterday, I’m at this point now where if I’m 30 (I’m 25 now) and I’m still still single or not in a relationship I want to be in, I still live with my mom and dad in their house, and still don’t have a full-time job, I think the easier option will be to shut off the voices for good and hope there’s such thing as “past lives” because I’m getting sick of being in this one. 

It’s really getting harder and harder everyday to find the hope and positivity when it doesn’t feel like it’s happened yet or will happen at all.

So i left school a year ago and since then many things went downhill, i started to study and lost contact to many of my friends and Additionally after a few months i realized i dont want to study this anymore. Because of my lonelines here my depression and mild anxiety got worse.. Mainly because sarcasm and generally talking about my problems was a huge vent for me.. 
Generally speaking i can balance things out and if there's nothing major going wrong.. i can keep myself motivated and care for myself even with depression..
So far so good, after the semester i wanted to work and applied for a job and even got to the job interview everything went really well and they seemed so optimistic 
I was really happy and thought id easily get the Job..

But then a few weeks later (last week) i got the mail that i didnt get the job.. So now i have to sit a new full semester in a study i really hate and i can barely motivate myself. Additionally the Situation with my parents is always annoying (for many complicated reasons) and even today im pissed that i have to visit them at the weekend.. But thats not all, my girlfriend struggles often and i needed to be there for here a few days ago which costs me energy, but since two days she feels better.

I haven't really been happy with life for a long time.  I have plenty of reasons to be happy, but I just don't enjoy life 90% of the time.  The other 10% feels like I'm faking it.  It feels like whenever I AM happy, it's completely temporary and I'm just waiting for the next crash, like being depressed is my natural state.  And I hate that.

I'm terrified that I'm never going to be happy in life.  That this is permanent, I'm never really going to get better.

I don't even know if therapy helps.  It sure doesn't feel like it.  It doesn't feel like my antidepressants help either, but I can't tell if they're the wrong dose or if that's just how it is.  I'm not suicidal but sometimes I wish I was.

I just desperately want to know this isn't permanent.  That all of my strives to try and change things, try and get better aren't for nothing.  I want to be happy but I just...can't?  And I'm terrified this is how it's always going to be.

I've been a pretty regular pot smoker for a while but I haven't tripped on anything since my depression got really bad a few years ago, since I always heard taking those sorts of things in a bad state of mind would give you a bad trip. I have to say, the past few months have been some of the worst i can remember, but the mushrooms brought me back to the me I remember from years ago. I laughed, I cried, I felt more in touch with myself than I have in so long. The next day, things were more or less back to how they've been so I'm not saying this is a miracle cure even a little bit, but I'm curious if anyone else has had similar experiences. The trip let me remember what being my old full self felt like, and even though I'm not back to that yet just a glimpse of how beautiful life can be is a HUGE deal.

I got a wild hair to go on a date - with myself - tonight. Weird. I have never thought that way. So I bought a nice salmon, some Sangria, bunch of fresh veggies and fruit - no crap food that only makes me feel worse, and I decided I’d go home (I live alone) and light a single candle while I cook in honor of me. One celebratory candle to signify I’m still here. I still have value. I’m still loved and lovable. I may be old, fatter, more wrinkles than before...depression has robbed me of much, much too fast, but fuck it. I have unexplored and under-developed gifts, talents, ideas - so tonight I’m going to celebrate me. The one and only me there is, no matter who else approves or disapproves, desires me or doesn’t, thinks about me or doesn’t. Because in this brief moment, I can see the miracle that is me.

560," I moved to the UK in 2017 from Singapore. I had a lot of friends there and was probably what you would consider one of the ""popular"" people in school - always going out, lots of friends, parties, smart (I know I might sound snobby and cocky but I had all that back then). Now that I live here, I don't have any of that. I barely go out, I can count the number of friends I have here on one hand, I have never been invited to a party here and my grades have dropped so bad that I had to drop a year (grade for Americans). I've visited Singapore twice in two years, and both times I blew over £600 (800 USD) in less than two weeks because I was out every night with my friends, getting fucked up, going for dinner, travelling etc. Now that I can't go back, I always see my friends doing those things without me every week. It frustrates me so much to see them be happy without me because I know I can't be with them. It's not just that they go out without me, it's also that they never make time to talk to me because they are so preoccupied. Weekends have been so lonely for me because there is nothing for me to look forward to, not even conversation. I don't value my friends here at all like I do with people back in Singapore. This girl told me a secret that she hooked up with a guy in school who had a girlfriend and when I asked her why she would tell me that, she replied with ,""because I really needed to tell someone and you don't have any friends so I'm not risking anything by letting you know"". This made me feel so shit because it was true. I'm just some stress ball for her. I can't tell my friends in Singapore that, they haven't made time for me. I can't tell my mum, she lives in Japan ( nine hours ahead so time difference makes it difficult to talk) and I can't tell my dad. My dad is a weird guy, he is the reason we had to move to the UK against every hope that I had. My mum was in tears when she found out we had to move to London and so was I. I guess it isn't that bad for her, she lives in Tokyo with her family so she has friends and stuff to do. I just realised that I have less friends than my mum or my dad. Anyway, since moving here, my dad drinks everyday. One day, he started drinking at 8:30 am after having an argument over the phone with my mum because of his drinking habits. In an effort to secretly drink that day, he put his wine in his coffee mug. Shit place to hide such a smelly drink. The day before, he had come into my school drunk and picked me up in his car. The humiliation is unlike anything I have ever felt before. I had two choices: stay home the next day and hide from the embarrassment or go to school to avoid my dad. I chose the second option. He has embarrassed me on several occasions: turning up to my football match drunk and shouting from the sidelines, initiating a massive argument with me in front of my friends, driving me home drunk, calling me in the middle of class and getting angry when I don't answer, calling out my teacher in front of me and my friends, taking the piss out of the fact that my school recommended me to a therapist... the list goes on. He did all of this while drunk. Finally, karma got to him and he fell down from the top of the stairs, shattering his arm (the doctor said it looked like a crushed packet of crisps) and stopped breathing twice in 10 minutes. I thought this was an enlightening moment for him and he would finally recover. Nope. that was over a year ago. If I was at school that day, he wouldn't have gone to hospital. A part of me wish I went to school. A couple of months ago, my mum finally came to London but only for a short while. My parents got into a massive argument again but it was much worse this time. My dad started accusing my mum of slashing his leg with a knife (obvious bullshit because there is no scar) and then threatened us with suicide. Imagine your own dad saying that he was going to kill himself if we didn't side with him. My mum wants to seperate, I want them to divorce and I want to move out. But I can't do any of that for at least a year and a half. I'm lost. I don't know what to do. All this time, my friends are just going out, having fun and doing whatever they want. They are even going on holiday to Thailand all together, except for me because I'm still in school. I hate seeing them have fun now. Nobody has to reply, I just needed somewhere to vent. Trying to see if talking or writing down how I feel helps at all. I've tried councillors but they don't help at all. They just somehow managed to make the conversation about themselves and change the subject. I do MMA to try and relieve some stress but that only works if I do well. I've fallen out of love with football because its just so shit in England. I don't have any real friends to talk to here so I can't do that. I've tried to run for executive positions within the school but that didn't work. Oh well, what can you do, hey?

However...My current job is not going to hot (hence looking for a new one) and I kind of went off last night via Skype on how I hate my current company, to a manager of said company. She said she won’t share it but who knows...

I’ve been trying to love more; I find that loving anybody is difficult when this disease is in your brain.

Contempt for myself is the most debilitating. “How dare you not prepare for your project better than everybody else, how dare you not get your homework done, how dare you fail that class.” I’m not saying that depression should be an excuse to fail a class, but the result of failing on depression is similar to an infection of an open wound. It’s much more painful, lasts much longer, and is potentially fatal. But with all that contempt I feel, why should I want a better life? Well I don’t. But why? I don’t deserve it, I’m a horrible human being. I’ve lied, cheated people, cheated on people, done drugs to avoid work. Who am I to deserve a content life? There isn’t a damn thing I do that I feel content about. Well, where do you want to live? Where do you want to vacation to? These questions aren’t to be ignored. One has to realize that potential exists in us all, and that we’re not all lost causes, if we all were then we wouldn’t want anything meaningful. We wouldn’t think about anything in the future. We wouldn’t think about how sometimes it feels really good to help people through their hard times, or how good it feels to catch that football and realize you’ve made it to the end zone and everyone is screaming your name, or how great it feels to stand up after a concert and show to the world how proud you are of what you’ve performed. I say to you, whoever reads this, to try to think about the meaningful things to you, and don’t just ignore them and consider them to be random flukes.

Life isn’t going to all the sudden be like what we see in movies, but you’ll start to cherish more and more when things do make you happy.

I am currently in the process of creating a new measure of rumination which have been found to have a strong correlation with depression.

When I was in 7th grade I was diagnosed with depression, I got put on medication, and it worked. After I got my depression under control my anxiety decided to step in and take its place. I got put on medication for that and it helped me out for a couple months. Then came 8th grade. 

I was having trouble with my school, so I decided to do online school that year, which wasn’t the best option as I had barely any people in my life (I have a small family and only a couple friends), so I became very isolated. I knew I was supposed to do more than just be on meds but I wasn’t presented with many opportunities to do things. I didn’t like sports and my parents and I had no idea how to find things for me to do/join. I honestly have no idea how I survived those 6 months. 

Then comes this year, I’m 15 and a HUGE mess. For most of the first semester I stayed home because my anxiety and depression were running wild, and I had no idea what to do because if I went to school I’d have panic attacks, but if I stayed home I’d be stressing out that I’m missing. I’d been trying counseling but all of the counselors were really presumptuous, and I had no idea what clubs my school had so I continued to be isolated. I somehow managed to pass all my classes (barely) but still felt like garbage. 

Here’s where things hit the fan. So, during my 3 month depressive episode I managed to mess up the one thing I was good at, which was making sure I took my medication. My mom and I had realized that I still had pills left over from November, so I was completely out of wack. Then in February I got diagnosed with ADHD, which is just great. My friends and I never have actual conversations, my parents and brother are the only people I talk to, and I’m still trying to find a counselor, but at least I’m going to school more than I used to. I still haven’t made any friends yet, and I understand that it’s because I haven’t been very present at school. It just hurts. The worst part is that my parents are the most supportive people in the world and it pains them that they don’t know how to help me, which in turn makes me sad that they’re sad. I don’t know what to do and I’m feeling pretty defeated but my gut is telling me it will get better.

579,"Posting on a throwaway account as to not worry anyone I know here on Reddit.

I moved from Florida to Texas a year and a half ago because my baby mama moved here with our son and I thought it'd be a good idea to start fresh and try and be a better father after me not falling out of bad habits the first few months of my son's life...I was an alcoholic cokehead, and was still in a self destructive party mentality fueled by depression I've been diagnosed with since high school, and totally neglectful of my son's and ex's needs.

They moved to Texas, and I followed. I've been clean since, have a full time job and an apartment. I'm around my ex and our son pretty much every day, and our co-parenting is going extremely well.

I love being around my son more than anything, but when I'm home at the end of the day, alone, everything hits me.
All my family and friends are in Florida. I talk to most of my friends from time to time, and I always see their posts on IG and Facebook. I'm still hear the gossip from everyone, like one of my best friends being with an old ex of mine, asking if it bugs me. I tell them no, I'm a dad now, I have a new life, but I let it get to me... it's extremely dumb. I used to be in a band, but broke up because of the move, and I still hear from people expressing disappointment and reminding me of past house shows and parties and all that jazz...I would delete all my social media, but honestly it's the only social interaction I get, whether it's just gossip, or friends who have been genuine to me and actually care to update me on their lives.

I have no friends here, all I do is work and be with my son. I have a few hours to myself at home before sleep. And when I do go out, I meet people and follow up, try and strike a friendship, but I never have time to arrange a time to meet because of work and dad life. So eventually that peters out. I'm extremely lonely and my depression has never been more hard hitting than this, now that I don't really numb myself anymore through substance abuse. 

I'm at a loss, any advice is appreciated. Thank you ",0
580,"Hello all,

It is my first time posting here. Made a new account for it. I started a new job at the end of Jan of this year. I have been struggling with mental health issues (depression and anxiety) off and on my whole life, but recently it has become unbearable. I stopped going to work a few days ago because I couldn't get out of bed so I figured I was fired. One of my managers messaged me a few days later and asked if I was coming in. I mentioned that I was having a rough time and wanted to know how to contact HR because I wanted to inquire about a personal leave. 

She gave me the info and I called, they asked a few questions, and I should expect a call today in regards to it. They told me because I have not been at my job for one year I was not eligible for the typical leave, but possibly for short term disability. Has anyone been through this before? I have never struggled with it this bad, am 32 now, and previously held down a job for 11 years.

I'm not sure if I should quit or try to take the short term leave if offered. I feel guilty for letting my team down because me calling out left them short handed and worried about them asking me questions upon my return, if it happens. Any advice is kindly appreciated.",0

I'm here just sitting, i didn't go to uni today to get this shit done but i feel so unmotivated, it's literally the last thing i want to do. An year ago i would be doing it gladly, bc it seems to be a big deal 

Not only that but my boss is giving me calls about my productivity, i don't get stuff done like used to. And then i realized this job fucking sucks... I'm 24/5 locked im my room doing shit for a company that don't really pays me that well. The upsides is that i have a flexible schedule, dont really have to deal with people, and the company is growing big so it might be good to stick around and get to be a senior 

If quit i would quit after receiving my paycheck, the thing is i don't have any backup job, so i will probably just stick around my parents house for a while, but i don't know if being there will do good for my mental health 

I really don't know if i feel like this about my job bc im depressed, or i am depressed and feeling like this is just a consequence

I’m tired of being mad at the world. I just want to sit down, hug someone and have them tell me it’ll be alright, even if alright isn’t forever.

584,"  In my life it always seems to be misery especially in my dating life. My life has always been emotionless and bland up till I met four people, one of which me and her mutually adopted as brother and sister, two became my best friends, and the last she became the woman i love more than anything and we seemed so happy together. We were always smiling having a good time and telling each other we loved one another every time we looked at one another.  
    
  My mind doesn't work like most people's i can only romantically look at one person at a time, until the give me a definite answer of when they want the relationship to end. So in my dating life something always happens that never fails to occur. No matter how happy we are, how much we talk or tell each other how we feel. They always disappear no explanation no warning, all i get is they always tell me that we are still dating, or in the process of making a relationship if we hadn't started already.  
    
  To be honest I can end a relationship my mind will not let me, and with my current girl I'd rather die than truly lose her. But with the last girl i was with, or trying to date she always told me she wanted to start a relationship but she wouldn't let it start, nor give a definite answer. Just silence for three months other than her telling me she still wanted it, but wouldn't let it start. This silence has happened in every attempt at a relationship, as well as in ever relationship i have had they always tell me we are still together that they love me, or that they still want to have a relationship but won't let us start one.  


  It ruins me. Countless days i spend tearing my mind apart then trying to piece it back together again. It is so painful that i often result to physical pain to dampen the emotional. The woman I am with now the one from the first paragraph i love her more than anything, with every fiber of my being. To lose her would mean I have nothing and no more reason to go on in this life. She's my everything and i can't lose that, today is our anniversary i don't know if will see her or not. The pain is getting to me more, and more I'm not sure how much more i can take before I do something stupid to try and drown it out. some people say no one is worth your own life, but to me she is worth my life, and so much more.

596,"I hate group therapy. I just don’t feel depressed in my day to day life now that meds have begun working. But the group therapist always insist I must be hiding my depression or problems with my smile, like a mask. Why can’t I just be happy that I have a good day? That I’m not controlled by anxiety and depression anymore. 

Sometimes they literally dim the lights and close the blinds. I hate being in the dark, awkwardly trying to relate. It makes me feel depressed being in an environment where everyone’s talking about how miserable their day is. But I cant relate anymore. I get to classes on time, I eat in the dining hall alone. I aced an exam. I just have more wins than losses. 

But it’s school mandated and I’m gonna get in trouble today because I’ve been ditching repeatedly. And they might kick me out of college I guess. To be fair, I was planning to drop out after this semester, just because I paid tuition and my grades are good. It’s just such a shitty situation. Mandated therapy just adds another level of stress to the equation. 

I miss my old therapist. Where we can just talk about the great parts of my day. I hate constantly being reminded that I’m taking pills for mental illness. I took a leave of absence last semester and I’m quitting after this semester but that’s okay. But I hate how that’s being treated as such a failure when I know it’s not. (“Aren’t you upset about the leave? It should be normal to be upset with yourself.”) But constantly being told that I’m failing even though I feel like I’m winning is chipping at my mental health. It’s making me doubt myself. 

I’m so stressed about the meeting today I’m anxious that I might relapse. But realistically, I know whatever happens I can handle. I just wish I could get more support from people around me for this. I know I’m doing tons better, I’m rarely sad or anxious. But my boyfriend and my family gets extremely stressed when I rant about stuff like this because they think I’m all better. 

But honestly, who wouldn’t be anxious about possibly getting kicked from school? Though tbh, I’m more stressed about being forced into the shitty group therapy than being kicked out. I actually think it’s undoing so much of the progress and self confidence I’ve been working on. I’d rather get kicked out then be forced to ruin my mental health. ",0

605,"I'm not sure if this is odd, but this actually isn't for me. This is about my boyfriend. I posted this problem originally under r/relationships and was told my problem may be better answered here.

Basics first. I am a 26F and my boyfriend is a 31M. We've been together for 6 years now, and boy what a 6 years it has been. We've accomplished a lot. We dealt with his psycho ex, which I know everyone calls their s/o's ex 'psycho', but you will have to take my word on this one. She has literally dropped his kids off to us in the middle of the night, high as a kite and said she didn't want to be a mom anymore. 4 months later she decided she wanted to be a mom again. Mind blowing...but like I was saying. We dealt with her, made it through a 2 year custody battle and obtained full custody of both his boys, bought a house together, new cars, had a baby, I graduated college and have my dream job. There's a ton to be happy about. Problem is, he isn't happy.

I like to think I'm reasonably attractive, funny and overall an understanding girlfriend. We don't really fight, I could probably count on one hand the number of times we had a serious fight. None of which escalated beyond a heated discussion and make up sex. The kids are great, very well loved and happy. Our baby is doing amazing, very healthy. 

So why is he angry all the time? The past year, any time the kids or I attempt to talk with him about anything he is always angry or upset. I've tried talking to him about this and his response is, ""I don't know what's wrong with me. There's tons to be happy about, but I'm not happy."" And that breaks my heart. 

We haven't been on a date in almost 2 years, I honestly can't remember the last time he complimented me and the only time I feel connected to him is during sex now. Which has now resulted in my unhealthy need to have sex constantly because I love him so much and want to feel connected anyway possible. But now the sex makes me sad. It isn't like it use to be. I've tried spicing it up, sending dirty pictures and flirting more to get him excited. I just don't think I'm enough anymore. UPDATE: I actually convinced him to go on a date with me last Sunday. I posted about this as well. Let's just say, it didn't go well.)

All I know is I feel devastated that he feels this way. I want him happy, even if it isn't with me. He swears I'm not the problem. Which I don't know if I believe...but either way I just want this resolved so he can either be happy or I can have closure and move on.

Any thoughts on what is going on with him? I'm happy to answer more questions if it helps. I was told on my original post that he may have depression or a mental illness. Which I've also felt, so I have suggested he see a therapist. His response is that seeing a therapist isn't something he would be open to. I definitely don't want to force him. Any advice at all is much appreciated.

611,"A little bit of backstory: I've always thought like I'm someone special, someone that can change the world, ever since I was in about third to fourth grade, and I was always outgoing, extroverted, empathetic, and fun to be with. I've made deep and genuine relationships with other people because of that. I've always thought differently from other people, excelling in my academics even though I don't study at all. Right now I'm in my 4th year at college, and I'm failing at least half of my subjects. I've become lazier, and find it hard to learn new things. I've been an atheist all my life since my first year of high school.

I've always thought of things differently, and considering both rational and emotional perspectives when making a decision. As I grew older, I realized more and more things about the world and the universe. I realized that we are very, very, very meaningless. Because of that, I find it hard to have the sense of urgency in the important aspects of my life (like graduating and having a job soon). Just last year I decided to check with a local psychiatrist and was diagnosed with anxiety disorder and depression. I was prescribed some medicine to help me sleep but after one month, I decided to quit taking it completely because I couldn't afford them anymore. Between that and today, my closest friends help me get through every day of my life and made myself dependent on them but recently I've become more and more ""self-destructive "" to the point where I cut my wrists, punch walls, and hit my head to just think of the pain and pleasure and ignore the things that I've been thinking.

I've been finding ways to change the way I think but so far, I have no idea how. I also realized that depending on other people is not healthy since they also have their own lives to think about. Right now I'm a bit drunk and alone, and no changes has happened since my realizations. It's just so fucking hard to realize these things but have no idea how to change them. I think I need help from other people who went through or who have been going through this that's why I decided to post here.",0

616,"I'm sorry for the novel. I have a lot of pets (I don't like that word but I don't want to be pedantic so I'll use it here) so bear with me as I describe their living situation.

Over the years I've been getting worse and worse with depression. When I was young and healthy we got 2 cats. They're outdoor cats (I didn't know better when we got them and I struggle to make them indoor cats now) and they're both spayed. Not up to date on worming I just remembered I need to make a vets appointment! God I need to put this stuff in a calendar.

At 16 when I recovered from depression (or so I thought) we got a dog with the idea she would help me be more active. I love her to pieces but I know if a couple thousand vet bill comes in for one reason or another, we wouldn't be able to pay it. I live with my parents and the dog is more theirs than mine because she spent more time downstairs where they are. She's not allowed upstairs alone because the stairs are too slippery and she's not careful on them. The first few months were great I walked her daily and taught her things and we went on morning runs with the sunrise. Then I relapsed and now she's only taken out every few days or even weeks sometimes. She's so damn happy but I know she should have a better owner. I'm trying to take her out more often to tire her out with fetch, tug of war and commands and to let her explore and meet pooches.

We also have parrots as they are my favourite animal. 3 cockatiels, a conure, and my biggest is an alexandrine (the size of a pidgeon). I have them in 3 separate cages which I got online as I couldn't find one big enough in a pet store. I found an even bigger one (62"" by 24"" by 37"" from what I remember) and I plan to get it and put the four smaller birds together as they really get along. All 5 get along really well so I thought to maybe even put them all together. The local parrot zoo has an aviary with these types of birds together so I trust them and think it'd be safe. 3 get let out around my room daily. Two of the tiels don't get let out as often as they're not yet trained to go back on their own like the others are. One white tiel had to be in a tiny travel cage for a week because she hurt her wing and wasn't allowed to fly and had to be given meds twice a day. She's okay now! But was really sad to not be together with her best friends.

My biggest problems are hygiene and vet checkups. I don't do yearly/ 6 monthly checkups like I learnt I should. I forget to worm the cats and dog (money isn't the problem, it's £18 for all 3 for 3 months). In terms of hygiene I don't think I take the time to clean the cages nearly well enough as I should. Mostly because I don't have the physical energy. Every time I look at the bottle of bird safe cleaner I feel guilty. I change out their litter tray regularly as it's easy to do but their perches and toys are a few weeks overdue for a good scrub in the tub. I don't cut them up fresh fruit/ veggies nearly enough either. I bought them some quality brand feed which has some dried fruits and veggies but that's not nearly enough for a proper healthy birdie. They won't eat unless the fruits and veg are finely chopped and that's what made me so lazy.

As you can tell I wrote the most about the parrots because I'm the one who takes care of them 100% of the time. The cats and dog are mostly my parents. They love them to bits especially our pooch. They have a rabbit too that's in an outdoor pen in our garden.

Even with all these animals I'm still tempted to get more and spend a lot of my time researching care for reptiles and fish. I won't get them because I know it's irresponsible. But I hate myself for wanting more.",0

618,"This is a really long one and I'm not the best writer so bear with me.


Backstory: in 2017 my depression started and it started bad. I moved away from my girlfriend and happiness 2 years ago on April 1, that summer was so, so lonely, I had no one and I did know what to do with my time. I stayed inside all day, lost my tan I had been rocking for years before that, read a lot of books and watched a lot of shows to fill the growing void in my stomach. In the 3 months of summer I only saw my girlfriend twice.


So when school started in September I wasn't the most exited since I didn't know anyone and being previously picked on and bullied (not bad just mostly isolation) I didn't know how people were going to react to the awkward new kid. When I arrived there was one other new guy and we became friends, I would like to take a moment to thank the living shit out of him, he kept me sane even though it was only for a short amount of time. 


The first few weeks were pleasant, there was no teacher yet so I was moving from class to class. Then came the next class, Ms. Wilson and she was amazing but went on maturity leave so that didn't last long and back to subs we were but this is where they come in. Mrs Fonceca then came in, Important later. 


Mitchel and Johnathan, two boys in my class who suddenly started talking to me. We met when I tried to play 4square with the girls in my class and they all yelled at me to go away, Johnathan comforted me and introduced me to Mitchel. Johnathan instantly flirted with me and I obviously wasn't interested so he backed off for a bit. Take note that both of them are shorter than be and a bit rounder in size, important later. Mitchel was friendly and generally a good guy at first. Friend and I were happy that we found more friends haza!  


Then one day Johnathan suddenly asked me out, Friend and Mitchel were staring at me waiting for my answer and what could I have said? I was dating a girl! I was still in the closet. Sure I'm Bi but I thought of them only as friends and I will never cheat on the person who has kept me happy. I tried telling him no but I only got bombarded with ""Oh so your against fat guys? that's low"" ""Such a bitch to think of me like that"" ""why not? its not like anyone else likes you"". I said we can hang out after school but its not a date.


The next day I walked into school and I instantly get surrounded by people asking why I picked Johnathan or why Johnathan? I was confused and Johnathan seemed to be avoiding me so I didn't know what was going on. At gym when changing the girls asked why I was dating Johnathan and if I liked him. Ding ding ding that's whats going on. When I confronted Johnathan about this he told me this was because I wouldn't go out with him and its not that bad. 


Then the next fucking week he started spreading rumors that he was dating another girl, this poor girl didst even know his name. I told everyone the truth and only a set amount of people believed me until they asked the girl. Through all this Mitchel comforted me, but the moment everything was cleared and I could breath again Mitchel asked me out and I instantly said no, I tried terminating my friendship with Johnathan but Mitchel stopped me. 

Trigger warning: 

Mitchel then started rubbing his hands on my shoulders any time we hung out. Whenever I said anything about him or Johnathan they would say nasty things about me and make everyone believe I was a slut or a whore or manipulative. They would apologize after everything but then Mitchel got worse the more I rejected him.

He started touching my thigh.

every time he walked by my next he'd reach don and touch it, lunch time I had to avoid the shoulder rubs and I could never do anything. Tell the teacher! I told Fonceca about everything and she said she would talk to them but every time they would ask why I tell they did nothing wrong. She did nothing about it, the principal was new and to nice to punish them.  I even tried to get his sister involved but she didn't do jack shit. 

I came home crying many many times because of them.

My previous depression came back at me like a title wave of sadness laced with knifes of words they said and things they did and I was not prepared. I missed a lot of school because I got physically sick because of them. Any time I tried to do anything I would get yelled at and rumors would spread. All this pressure got to me and I started acting out, I was more angry towards my loved one and even sharpies the bathroom walls. Which I got caught for.


when my mom asked me why I did that I broke down and told her everything. We agreed to do something about it, she told my dad and hey started fighting to get m happy again. I fucking love them. At this point Johnathan had touched my but a few times and Mitchel was dangerously close to other areas. 


I asked my teacher why she kept putting me with Mitchel and Johnathan and she said its apart of protocol that when a student gets bullied you put the victim and the abuser together so they sort it out on their own. I asked her if most of my grade is participation, she said yes, I told her Ill take the C because I don't want to be sexually assaulted anymore. She choked on her gum. I did the same with the P.E teacher who didn't like me. 


I dropped out. I left. I couldn't stand it anymore and I joined into homeschooling. During that time I had cut twice and was close to death due to Depression and now Anxiety as well. even though I was now out of there I developed Insomnia because every night I would wake up to night terrors f that school. Never saw a therapist and to this day Depression Anxiety and Insomnia are daily aspects of my life even though Girlfriend and Parents helped me.

My problem? 

I saw Mitchel again. I told him to fuck off but he explained to me that he changed and the only reason he acted like that was because his parents were divorcing. I stood by my choice and told him to fuck off again, he called me a bitch and left.  I was being a bit of a bitch and he looked hurt. 

I don't regret telling him off but did I do the right thing?

He was going through shit and just needed to take it out, he got diagnose with a personality disorder as well so it's not fully his fault for doing that to him. 

Did I make a mistake by not forgiving him? ",0
619,"Hey guys. So I work 24 hours a week in a crappy low paid job, some months it literally pays less than I'd get if I were on  unemployment benefits but I never want to do that again. I've been so depressed lately and really lacking motivation. I can't bring myself to work more because I HATE my job, yet I need to find a way to bring in more income. Right now my cupboards and fridge are basically empty and I have pretty much no food until I get paid in 5 days. This happens EVERY month and I am sick of it, and it adds to my depression that I have barely any money all the time but at the same time I'm too tired and too depressed to do anything about it, I'm too anxious and depressed to get a job that means leaving the house. Any tips or anything anybody does from home for a little extra cash that isn't too draining? ",0
620,"Every day I have free from work or other responsibilities I just sleep. I wake up, fall back asleep, wake up again to eat, go back to sleep, then before I know it my partner is home from work and I have to pretend like I didn't have such an unproductive day in fear he will judge me.

I feel like when I sleep I am free from all anxiety and fear, it's an escape for me that has become very addictive. But it is also very damaging. I feel lethargic at work, I have a hard time facing small tasks (phone calls make me want to kill myself), and I get antsy when my partner brings it up. 

He sees it as me being lazy. It's not that, it's because I am so overwhelmed with emotional distress on a day-to-day basis that I feel sleep is the next best thing to being dead.

Has anyone had any experience with this? Can you recommend some way to break the cycle? I am starting to feel miserable that my free time is always slipping away from me.

Ugh. This is all just the worst.",0
621,"Hello, I’m still kind of new to posting. Over my Christmas break I came across the show “Mr. Robot” and watching it has been so therapeutic. At first I thought it was kind of corny, but as I watched and saw Elliott cry over being lonely but at the same time not wanting to interact with the people around him I felt such comfort. There’s other moments, such as him imagining he’s in a better place if he’s not in a good one at the moment and I find that so relatable. The show has really helped with my depression and made me felt less alone. Has this show or any other show with a character who struggles with mental illness made you feel similar?",0
622,"It's come this far now. My mom can not decide. When I eat little, she yells at me. When I eat much she yells at me. She just yelled at me and almost hurt me because I threw away a piece of sushi I didnt want to eat anymore.

So I've decided. She's going to pay for that. She's a psychopath and I know she doesn't care for me. If she can't decide how much I should eat? Then I'll starve myself. It's better than being yelled at all the time.

I know this is wrong. It is. But it makes me feel good. My depression got worse. I forgot to take my meds a lot in the last time and picked up self-harm again. I dont know what to do. I've been on autopilot since days, just going to school and coming home, hoping that today was one of those days that my mom goes away to her stupid concerts.

I dont know why I'm posting this. Maybe I want advice. Or someone to stop me. Mostly I want to talk and hear from similar experiences. The point through depression when you decided you were gonna stop something as essential as this. It's not that I want to die or be anorexic. That's not it. I just dont want her to judge me on eating. So I'm not gonna do it. She knows very well I'm depressed. She doesn't care. My friends dont care. The only person I have is my step father and even he is slowly frustrated.

This is a rant or something. Yeah. I'm giving up. Not in killing myself but in destroying myself. And hoping someone other than me suffers under it. My mom can see where she goes to when her oldest child ends up in the hospital. She probably wont care. But still.

624,"Well how could you possibly say youre depressed you ask? Well. The answer isnt a short one.  Ive never cut myself,  never been an angsty teen. Never looked at a bottle of pills or something and told myself I was going to end it . Ive never had a mental breakdown in front of others.  I have woman that I love. That i know is my true love.  Ive been poor most my life but have had loving parents. And Ive had many experiences. All those years I told myself I would be happy once I had this. Or that, or someone to share life with or once I got that job I want . (Unemployed currently)  . I have a pretty normal life for my age, early 20's . Good friends. And yet. I feel so fucking alone . Always. I have feelings inside of me that dont make sense to me. I cant talk to anyone because it wouldnt make sense at all objectively. Its almost as if its an inability to be happy. I WANT it so badly . Anyone else in my shoes I feel WOULD be happy.  So why arent I? It makes me angry. I feel like im gruel, a tasteless slop. I have all the nutrients I need but I just dont have any of the flavor. Like I was made without that special something that makes you appreciative . And then last year I felt like I was dying, rushed to the ER and it turned out I was having an anxiety/panic attack? Dont really know, doctor just said to talk to a friend or family member and told me to be on my way.  And when Im alone at times, randomly my heart will race.  I cry uncontrollably (i don't cry much at all) and I feel this what can only be called dread. Its this horrible feeling. Just a deep sadness and panic and I feel like I cant tell anyone even while having it . Because I know theyll just brush it off. Its not something theyve been exposed to. Im usually so composed.  And for them to see me like that for what would appear to them to be for absolutely NO reason. Because I wouldn't have an explanation. I don't have a good one anyway . Im sorry I ranted. I just feel really emotional.  For no fucking reason.  Sorry guys.  ",0
625,"I just listened to a track by suicideboys that wrecked my whole afternoon. I just need to vent and maybe share stories/grievances. 

The song got me thinking about my own dead friends and relatives. The two biggest impacts being my friend who killed herself in high school and my brother who died of cancer. My friend jumped into traffic two days before thanksgiving. She had just turned 18, just graduated high school in the spring, and she was just gone. My brother had been given 6 months so we had some time to prepare, but he was only 14. I woke up to my brother laying dead on the couch. Looking at his lifeless body was...a little traumatizing. I miss them both every day. I’m not depressed because they’re dead, but it doesn’t help me in my state of mind right now that I’m in. 

What do you do to cope when this stuff happens? I normally just cry till I can’t anymore, but it never really makes me feel better. Sometimes I just smoke cause it’s hard for me to be sad when I’m high. ",0

627,"I have a crush on a girl i know for about 6 months.

It happened to me about 2 weeks ago. Got in a program for 6 months in october and had a late interest on her.

What surprised me is that she didn't looked like my previous crushes. She always looks kinda tired, never or almost no make up but it's ok with her.

I feel like what got me the most was to see a 20-23 ish girl that had a maturity and calm that i found very rare with girls of today (comparing to other girls from the program).

Add this and that, i think it was a little dream of me that was being real and out of pretention.

But as my previous experiences and one of my current goal in life is not to get something going with the other party, i'm just feeling like a lone sailor smiling knowing the ocean and his boat too well for what's gonna happen.

To not add many details, monday might have been the last time i saw her but i'm gonna be careful on that point.

Since it's recent and i am now out of time because of the end of the program, that was an easy from the start. But it hurts a bit to know it in advance.

i’m not a very open person and it takes a lot for me to say what i feel and the moment i do i get fucking dismissed as just “being too sad” and that i just need to “cheer up”. no shit sherlock. and when i tried opening about my self harming they’re quick to dismiss it, not even taking into consideration how HARD it is for me. my mom went so far as getting angry at me because i “wasn’t thinking about her and how she would feel about my situation.” i tried opening up to my friends but they just told me to just sleep it off and it’ll be better in the morning and then proceeded to get annoyed when i tried saying that it isn’t that simple.

it’s just so sad and cold for your friends and family to totally shut out your cry for help. the people who you thought would love and support you would rather turn a blind eye on your suffering just so they can pretend everything’s fine. i’m not claiming to be some saint but i sure as hell would never do what they did to a person in need.

i’m just so angry and sad on how i was treated and i don’t know who’s more wrong - them being dismissive over my obvious cry for help, or me thinking i’d actually get some sort of support from them.",0

645,So first of all I highly recommend listening to this song it’s beautiful in its melancholy. I’ve been listening to this song on repeat for a while now and I feel like you guys and gals would understand why. It’s just the infatuation with yesterday that I think all people with depression have. I always thought of depression as a shitty rollercoaster. On the “ups” I feel like we look back and beg for a second chance at yesterday. A second chance to try and be productive. To try and inch closer to the dreams that feel as if they are slipping away. On the “down” section yesterday always feels like it was better compared to today and that there is more hope in the past than the future. I would give anything for more attempts at yesterday yet I still fear what lies before me in tomorrow. I know this a rant and going nowhere but I know y’all will understand ,0
646,"I recently watched a Ted talk by Andrew Solomon about depression. One of the things that caught my attention is the way he described it:
“You don’t think, in depression, that you’ve put on a grey veil and are seeing the world through a haze of a bad mood. You think that the veil has been taken away, the veil of happiness and that now you can see truly. We, however, think that we see the truth, but the truth lies”

When I listened to his words the first time, something clicked inside me. I realized that I finally have a description and name for what I've felt for so long. Depression isn’t a dark filter that blocks happiness and only shows sadness. The truth is, it’s the absence of all veils, all filters. It is us seeing the unadulterated and raw truth of the world around us that leaves us in shock of our surroundings.

Depression is a tricky matter to handle and deal with. I’ve had a prejudice against those who claim to suffer from depression. It was hard to determine if they’re suffering from it or are simply having a hard day and feeling sad or upset. However, I’ve learned of the dangers of such prejudice. In the sea of depression, to sum everyone up and doubt them is to doom those who truly suffer. The spectrum of depression is tall and wide. Depression can manifest in the wealthy and poor and the social butterflies and the shut-in introverts.

If depression had a song, it would be of silence. It’s the quiet suffering crawling under one’s skin, draining away taste, smell, color and the will to live. One starts questioning: Is it worth waking up early, going to work? Is it worth brushing my teeth or, take a shower? Is it worth heating my food before eating it? Is it worth talking to a friend or family member to check on them? Is it worth sharing my suffering? Would anyone even understand or be able to identify with it? Is it worth investing time and effort into learning a new skill, pursuing a new hobby, discovering a hidden talent? Is it worth it to struggle in the world and achieve new feats when we’re all going to die anyway?

Is life worth living…?

Why is life worth living…?

Uncertainty and doubt possess one’s mind. The sounds of discouragement overpower all logic and reason. If depression was a mirror, it would reflect you as a small weak slimy creature that’s barely able to stand. It would show a broken smile and shifting eyes that avoid looking into anyone’s eyes. Every encounter is a new trigger for anxiety and horror. Every event creates an ultimatum: Will you face life and wallow in pain, or will you run away and drown in pity?

Is it worth proving oneself and improving when the odds are stacked against you?

Aren’t we all programmed to fail?

Engulfed by the soul-numbing void, one has no voice. Suffocated by the thick pain as it swallows and drowns the soul, one can feel no more.

You forget to smile, only reacting with one because the situation calls for it. Your emotional responses become diluted washed down versions of the genuine ones. You feel like an actor waiting for his queue to put on a reaction.

It always bothered me, how those who can truly bring true joy and happiness to others are often the ones who suffer the most. I thought at first that them identifying with and living through pain and suffering makes them able to heal it in others. But, why can’t they heal themselves? Where do they get the happiness that they lack and give it to others?

Trapped in one’s own mind space with a numb heart and a shattering soul, depression is the active process of a human withering.

I am not strong, I am not brave, I don’t know where I’m going or what I’m doing.

It’s the negative aura that originates from what I lack and am missing.

I have hit rock bottom, reached the bottom of the depths of the void. At that moment, after spending what seemed like an eternity, it hit me.

This is my strength, this is my fuel, this is my raw form. I can’t live in blissful ignorance. My eyes were exposed and were changed for good. My soul tasted the true form of life. I need to overcome this phase of being shocked.

If I can’t enjoy, then I will bring joy to others. If I can’t speak, I will listen to those who need me to listen. If I can’t see vivid colors, smell genuine scents, taste the depths of flavor then I will pour the residual traces and fumes into others to truly appreciate them.

What is it like to be depressed…?

It is to live.

647,"I do it all the time, sometimes I will get depressed and when I do I will destroy things I enjoy. Not physical things of course, I have no physical things aside from this computer as I have already given everything else away, I am talking about projects or accounts that I have poured hundreds of hours into online. 

At first it was my social media, as I scrolled through all the profiles of my ""friends"" (don't even know who half these people are) I had a moment of realization and anger that I was a social outcast, immediately I wiped the internet clean of any accounts or mention of me. It happened again with my video games, I spent thousands of hours and hundreds of dollars on my steam account but in another one of these 'moments' of anger and hate of my anti-social self I deleted everything and changed all my details, that account is now lost forever. So I bought myself another steam account, this time I only used it to develop mods for a the games I enjoyed. I would spend hundreds of hours on these massive projects, I would get halfway through a mod and realize it was pointless and delete it, the next day I would wake up and spend the next few months making another mod, rinse and repeat. 

Immediately before posting this I did it again, I worked a lot on a mod for one of my friends and I loved it but the thing is I took a break from it recently, so my friend found another person to completely re-make the mod for him. All my work was for nothing and I feel used, worst part is its probably my fault for putting off development for so long, once more I have deleted my steam, the money and all time I spent on it is gone again. I then removed all links I had with that friend and scrubbed that mod from the face of the Earth. It isn't the first time this has happened either, I had many disagreements with my friend over the mods development, I would delete him and remove the mod from the internet in moments of anger at how disrespectful and demanding he was at the free and time consuming work I was doing on the mod.

Now I feel pretty meaningless. I have no real friends, don't care much about finding any. No virtual friends either. No hobbies what so ever, I don't own a single video game anymore. There isn't a job in the world that gets me motivated. Since I left the military nearly a year ago my life was just jumping between Reddit and Youtube while I wait for my friend to come online so we can play with the mod. In a twisted way this could be a good thing, I will not lie that friend was a very broken person, much more broken than I could ever be. Maybe its for the best?

But now, as the old meme goes, ""Guess I'll die?"" ",0

652,"I don't know what to do with my life, and my mental health only makes it worse. I'm doing my first semester in college this year and it has been fuckin' awful: the environment sucks, I don't have any friends because no one seems to be interested in that shithole, and I'm sure that I don't want to work with the stuff I'm studying. I'm all alone in a big city, it's terrible. I don't want to do anything... why should I? I want to lock myself up in my room and just sit there all day looking at the ceiling. Meanwhile, my brain bombards me with things like ""Hah, you're just using this ""poor mental health"" bullshit so that you can have an excuse to slack off"". The other thing is feeling like e fuckin' leech, with my parents investing so much money in my life that I feel guilty: college, living expenses... it just makes this weight that I carry in my chest heavier and heavier. I struggle to distract myself in a daily basis, so that I don't fall on this mindset... but it's so goddamn hard. It all worsens up when I look into the mirror and I see the piece of shit that I am, both physically and mentally. I don't want to go out and make people look at my ugly face, it seems that everybody is looking at me and thinking ""wow what an ugly person jesus christ"", I know this is impossible, and I'm paranoid, but I can't help but feel that way. I shouldn't enter in my sexuality issues because they're all fucked up as well. With that many problems, I constantly think: ""What went wrong? How did I become such a broken person? Why can't I function like a normal person?"" It's so hard to find the answer.  
This weekend I went back to my hometown and during the trip these precious memories came back to me. My teenage years, with so many friends, nothing to worry about but getting good grades or texting someone you were interested in, all the happy moments I lived over there... I almost cried when I walked on those nostalgic streets back home, while listening to music. It was so beautiful. I miss those days... that's the only way I found for being in peace: looking back in my memories for times that I was truly happy.  ",0

655,"I do not really know how to begin a post like this, so I guess I'll just start writing every little fucked up thing that happened in my life, because I have no one to listen. I am a girl, and I am almost 16: if you think I'm young and have no idea of what I'm telling, go on, maybe it's true. You can tell me anything, insult me any fucking way, there's not a chance I haven't already been called like that.
I was born in a family with economical problems, they were almost broke when I came to life. My mum was 22, my dad was 23. We lived in a really small house with only one room and a bathroom. To get money, my dad went to another country to work and I used to see him only once a year for two days; then we bought a bigger flat not too far. I do not remember much about my childhood, I only know I used to spend all my days playing on my own in my small room, happy and innocent, I loved reading and read at least one book a day. At the age of seven, we moved to the country where my dad used to work, which I prefer not to mention. Things were quite normal, until I became an early teen, at the age of eleven/twelve. That's pretty much when shit started happening. For some unknown reasons, my parents started to abuse me both phisically and verbally for pretty random reasons. They only cared about what their friends thought about them, about their car, their home, their clothes, so they did everything possible to make a good impression. That fucking impression was more important than me, they didn't give a fuck, they just wanted me to become a fucking trophy to show off: you know, the perfect daughter. Fact is, I wasn't perfect at all. I was insecure about my looks and my body, about my abilities, there were many prettier and funnier girls and I was pretty much invisible. They would punish me if I got any bad marks (B was considered a bad mark too), but not only that. My mother let me was myself only twice a week, even if I did sports (sports that they had chosen). Then, here comes something that I personally find so stupid, so unworthy of everything but which was, apparently, a big deal: I pretty much do not feel cold, I sweat a lot and get really hot just by walking. It was march, and I was suffering a lot all that heat, so I just put on a normal t-shirt and jeans. My mum started swearing at me, calling me a worthless whore (12 years old), that I wanted to show off, that I was the dishonor of the family and told me to put on a winter heavy jacket. I refused to, in tears, trying to explain that I just felt too hot and that it made me dizzy. She pulled my hair, throwing me on the ground, and started hitting me everywhere, even cutting me with her nails, while choking my screams. She went on with that for like five minutes, while I was crying and screaming, and when she finally left me, I was bleeding from both my arms, and my legs and arms and chest were all purple and black. But this is just one example, it kept happening almost every two or three days. And it went on for three years. Both my mum and dad used to call me a whore, a bitch, a useless person, stupid, meaningless, the worst thing that happened in their lives. But the worst was when my dad would hit me. He is really big and so fucking strong, whenever he'd hit me i would feel a pain I cannot describe. A fucking pain that fucking went on for three fucking years, I swear, I used to get hit so much that now as now I am almost insensible to pain. I can break a bone, get a really deep cut, pour myself in boiling or freezing water and feel pretty much nothing. That's how much of it I had to bear. Thinking about it now makes me feel so pathetic and powerless that I want to crawl into a fucking ball and disappear forever. Which is what I wished for a very long time. The real pain wasn't even seeing  my two parents, the two people who gave me life, coloring me black and green and purple and pouring their own child's blood over and over, it's the way it felt emotionally. I used to cry every night for hours, wondering what I did wrong to deserve all of that. The first year, the stupid me thought it was actually my problem, that I was the wrong one. But, beggining from the second, I just...I couldn't stand that anymore, I started getting sick of it. So sick of it that I started fighting back, hitting them with whatever I got to defend myself, biting them, running away. One day my mum almost choked me, and I fought back harf because I couldn't actually breathe. That day I screamed so much I lost my voice. When I hit my dad, he called the police (people he knew well) and made up that I was the first who attacked them and that I was crazy, I came in crying unable to speak but of course, they believed them, who were faking tears and all, and they told me if it happened again ""they would make me understand what pain is"". After that, I had become really strong so that they stopped abusing me phisically because I could run away or fight back really well; but of course, the verbal teasing wouldn't stop. The basic concept they made is that I am a whore, and apparently the only reason is that I am a girl: they call me a whore just because I wear t-shirts and shorts in summer. I am almost 16 now, and the verbal shit never stopped. We just stopped talking. When I started High School things calmed down a little: it was as if we left our past behind and started all over again: that was because in all of this I had kept being the first of the class, and they wanted to show everyone how smart THEY MADE ME. I loved studying because it was my only way out of all that shit, I became a science lover, I still loved to read and had won many writing prizes, because all that mental freedom, the knowledge, made me feel free. I was not allowed to go out almost never, and if I did, I had to call them every 10 minutes and send pictures of where I was. It made me feel like I'd never become like them. Unfortunately, I didn't realize I had became so violent that I started hating everyone and everything, pretty much because they parents loved them unconditionally, and I lacked love my whole life. I never had real friends. My whole family is fucked up, and they ignore my existence or insult me together with my parents. I hated everyone and everything, and I started being really aggressive to my classmates. I had so much anger, resentment, pain, grudges, things I knew I could never actually forget, that raging at everyone was the only way I had to take it out. I had became exactly like them. After me beggining high school, they made discussions out of anything. My mum didn't want me to shave, she didn't want me to talk to boys, she would check my phone twice a day trough chats, gallery, all my browser and socials history and everything, not wanting me to even swear or watch tv-series which involved love or violence, same for videogames. Eventually, I didn't listen to them and did everything I wanted. At some point I died my hair and they made a drama that went on for months, not letting me out as usual. I didn't want to anyway. I had reached a point of self-awareness that I knew by myself that I didn't want to drink, to smoke, to do drugs or attend disco parties: I only wanted to become someone and go away. An artist, a writer, a scientist. I kept on studying because it was my only hope. Then, I fell in love. My parents never knew and still don't know anything about it, because I'm pretty sure they'd abuse me more than they ever did. They want me to get married with someone they approve, with the same religion (I am an atheist, if a fucking god existed i would've never been trough all that shit). I fell in love with a guy my same age who pretty much went trough the same shit. He had also a girlfriend, if I can call that a girlfriend, who cheated on him with five different people. I helped him recover, it was a long distance relationship, but it was the first bit of love I ever tasted. I cannot describe how much I loved him; and still do. But we broke, today, because we kept arguing and he'd become really violent towards me. At that point, I lost it. I had enough of everything.
Why did he want to kill himself because of a fucking piece of shit who cheated on him a billion times with five different people, but insults me who have always been super loving and kind? Why? What did I do wrong?
Why have my parents treated me this way all my life? What have I done so fucking wrong? They should've been proud of an indipendent girl who can stand by herself and who is smart. But I see that every other parent loves they child no matter what, even if they are wasted, helpless, bad people, wicked, no matter the way they are. Why? FUCKING WHY? The only good thing in this shit is that I wrote a book, it was my life dream, 30 chapters, more than two hundred pages. I hoped that if it got published, I could get myself money and go away from the people who never loved me. I had enough feeling useless, worthless, invisible, nobody. But it's not getting published because they do not want to, so I deleted it. 

I will never be capable of living knowing all the shit that happened to me. I will never feel happy, because I never knew how it feels.
I am sick of being abused every day
I am sick of being called a monster by my classmates because of a behavior I wouldn't have if it wasn't for my parents.
I am sick of being shamed for things I never did.
I am sick of being the innocent one suffering.

I feel like either Killing myself or them every day more. My life isn't done, it had never begun in first place. But I heard tons of 10 years old telling they want to kill themselves because they didn't get a videogame they wanted or shit like that, when I was abused for years. I will live for my own pride. But it will be awful.

659,"Hey everyone, this is my first post.

So... as the title suggests... I don't care anymore. Today as I sit at my desk in my office, I feel like I could walk out, get in my car, and never come back. I've recently pulled 12, 13, 14 hour days, and the work is just never ending. I used to could knock out long days with no problem, but last Thursday, I honestly woke up and hated everything I do, and I hate the person I am.

I will be 32 in 11 days. And I feel like I wasted my life. I feel like I sacrificed everything to work. So yeah, whoo hoo... I'm successful and I make a lot of money, but I don't have anything to show for it. I don't have a family. I don't have a serious relationship. I was going to get married to a man I spent 10 years with, but he got bored and decided I was no longer enough for him. We broke up when we were 26. My mom, my aunts and uncles, my cousin, and my grandmother are all I've got... and my mom's been seriously ill lately. But she won't go to the freaking doctor.

I honestly don't fucking care anymore. Everything I do is like Groundhog Day. It's like... do I really have 4 years experience at my current job, or just 1 year experience repeated 3 times?

I have friends, and a curated online presence with thousands of ""friends"" on facebook and instagram. I have good relationships with my friends when we hang out in person. But I feel like I'm worn out with everything. Everywhere I turn, there's another magazine to read, another skill to learn. I have to always be at the top of my game at all times. A late submission on a deadline, delayed timelines... all of this makes me feel like I'm not on top of anything anymore.

662,"Let's say you have a blocked nose. After a day or two, you can't really remember what it was like to breathe properly. You try for a while to remember but you can't, because your mind took it for granted that you'd be able to breathe properly. A few days later, you have fixed the problem and you cxan breathe again. You can barely remember what it was like to have a blocked nose. This is the experience of a healthy person.

Let's say your nose has been blocked for years. Not only can you not remember what it was like breathe freely, you are not convinced that you've ever been able to breathe freely. It's been like this for so long that you can't understand what it would mean to breathe freely.
Let's say, during these years, all aspects of your life and personal ability have degraded. Things that were once trivial are now impossible. Those around you noticed this, but shamed you. They said you were lazy. They said that you consider how your failures affect them. They call you selfish.

Let's say you've done some thinking about whether or not your nose is blocked. You seem to have the symptoms but to blame your multiple and impressive failures on a blocked nose seems like a cop-out. After all, you've heard the stories. A person with circumstances much worse than yours, with a condition much more severe than yours, managed to succeed. Surely if they can do it with those circumstances, your situation should be a landslide. But it isn't. 

Let's say you've thought about your situation some more. You've decided that there are 2 possible situations you are in and 2 solutions.
The first situation is that your nose is actually blocked. It hasn't always been this way and there actually is an external force warping your mind. How fucking weak would you have to be in order for a nose so lightly blocked that you have to seriously think about whether it is even there, to ruin your life? How fucking pathetic do you have to be for you not to find the drive to fix it? How lazy does someone have to be to wallow in a blocked nose, sitting in their room and waiting for the days to pass. It may not have been your fault that your nose was blocked, but you still have failed at every opportunity. You will continue to fail. The only escape is actual fucking work, or death. And we both know you can't work for shit.

Let's say that a part of you is unconvinced that your nose is truly blocked. That part of you thinks that you are making all of this up just yourself and other that this isn't your fault. It twists your thoughts of self-care into thoughts of shame. You can say all you want. You can lie to therapists. You can lie to friends. You can lie to parents, siblings, strangers and even yourself. But I know you. I know what you are. I know you are a sack of worthless garbage who has brought but dissapointment upon those who had audacity to believe you could succeed at anything you tried. You try to make yourself feel better by saying your condition has made you lazy, unmotivated, uncaring, unlovable, unlikeable and unhappy. But I know you. I know that those things are the centre of you. You will know nothing but failure and you will drag down those who care enough to watch. Until they will give up on you. Your future is a lonely spiral into the depths of human failure. You should just kill yourself before they give up you. They'll be able to pretend that you would have been able to pull yourself out of your hole. People tend to romanticize the memory of people who kill thenselves after all.

Let's say you've thought about all this, but you still haven't thought about that other solution. You've covered the two situations and you've pondered the same solution for them both. You surmise that the other solution must be to, somehow, get better. Or, at least, not get worse. You don't know how you might do this, but it seems like the kind of solution that most people would suggest, so surely there is merit there. You decide to make a reddit post, at 5am in the morning. You don't like saying the word ""Noseblock"". You don't know why. You decide to replace it with something else, just so you can get your thoughts out without cringing to yourself. 

I just want to die.

I also have a sister whos 3 years younger than me and now a stepbrother thats 4-5 days old. idk if this was neccesarry but it thought it would be nice if you knew who i am. 

&amp;#x200B;

Well since about 7 months ago i've kinda lost it, when it comes to grades, friends etc. I've skipped school ALOT (and just stayed at home ) and i havent hung around with my friends in forever except for some isolated cases. Im conflicted now because skipping school is now coming back to bite me in the ass, my grades have plummeted and i feel like im not in touch with my friends. At first i thought i was just lazy since ive always been a very lazy person but now that im trying to go to school again i just cant do it, i despise most of the subjects i have (naturalscience) except for biology and english since its so easy for me (yeah i know you might not see it in this text). I know self classification of psychological diseases and such is a bad idea and that my generation (r/2meirl4meirl etc) throw around depression alot but im just not feeling fine. Im not feeling so horrendously bad that i want to kill myself, i loathe the idea of it but its been on my mind more than id like, i feel anxious about many things and im never truly happy (yes i play games and that but i feel like those are just temporary rushes of ""i did something good woho""). Also since ive been skipping school i havent eaten as well as i should since im not eating whats provided at school.

&amp;#x200B;

Well the paragraph before this was just nonsense of me describing myself, im going back and forth to writing this text but in general the title sums up what i feel. I feel like i lack a sense of direction, except for the temporary sense of relief i gain when i paint a model, play games or read books im never really happy. I have no idea what to do with my life after im done with my ""highschool"" except for finishing the mandatory months in the army. I guess im just asking for what people in my situation have done or think i can do to find a direction or what else. Someone with real depression might read this and think what the fuck am i going on about im just lazy and that might be right, i might just be venting. I think im going to read what other people are writing here, idk why. Sorry for the hastily written text, i just felt that i wanted it over with.",0

Never married no kids my dreams are long gone I realize at 39 my life is half over and I have nothing to show for it. A few years ago I just stopped caring about anything. I'm done. I'm just waiting to die. I promised my mom I wouldn't kill myself because my grand father and aunt commited suicide and I don't want her to lose her father sister and son to suicide but at this point I will do it the moment she is gone. I'm in great health I know my inactivity is starting to cause heart problems but guess what? Dont care. In fact I hope it kills me so I can get out life soon without actually committing suicide. Ive heard it will get better for years bit it doesnt. In fact things manage to find a way to get worse. I lost my health insurance so I cant afford my meds and they barely helped when I had them.

669,"Im 30. Two kids. 4 yr w\autism and a 1 yr old.
Ive been with my old lady for 7yrs known her for 12.
Shes got spinal issues and epilepsy/seizures

Lately ive just been feeling so off. Normally i ignore alot about life and keep pushing thru. But the consistent nagging from my SO has me walking on eggshells and i just dont wanna be home to hear all the bitching. Whether its the roof that needs fixing, my hyper active 4yr old or generally my annoying habits.
 I work asphalt construction in michigan and i work 14+hour days 6 days a week and i get 4 months off in winter. Which i still have to work with lesser hours. Im able to provide and pay all our bills but it never seems like its enough. Right now I've been on edge cuz with being on call for my asphalt job and juggling home life I'm expected to wait on her and the kids constantly. We had an uneasy understanding that while im the breadwinner and worker she should be the stay at home mother and i help out where possible. She doesnt need to work cuz she gets over 1g a month from her mothers SSI because she had passed away.  I do the outside chores, get  all of the groceries [she doesnt drive] and run errands. 
Shes constantly attacking me for playing video games while she hides out in the kitchen making jewelry and staring at her phone but says i spend too much time on the internet myself. Nothing i do seems right to her.  
I'm just overloaded lately with feelings of guilt and suicide. Like. The kids'll be self sufficient in a few years, my 4yr old basically keeps himself going besides needing snacks drinks and occasionally play time with us. But she keeps going in the negative with a defeatist type attitude. Ive got 27 more years before iam able to retire and my job is so physically demanding that some days i just ache from being alive. I know shes in constant pain herself with her spinal issues. I just cant really get over the fact a few months ago our 4yr old threw up some food while she took a nap. She heard it and came running out screaming at me and him for never letting her rest and I remember her saying that she hated me and him and that we just cause her constant headaches and that having kids was a mistake.  And im a lazy good for nothing that wont lift a finger cuz im busy trying to escape our home life. In a sense. Yeah. I need tons of breaks. I had to quit smoking pot for my union job andi hate drinking. So occasionally i try to spend 2-3 hours over at a buddy's house to unwind. I brought it up to her about hating me and she said she didnt remember saying it anx we'll be fine for a few days. 
She was miserable living with her dad before we started living together but im thinking now its just her reality tunnels veiwpoint to see things in thay light. She has anxiety issues and uses them not to go out into the real world anx when we do she gets so mad and frustrated she makes scenes and accuses me that its easy for me to be out in public. But truth is i hate it too but its something we gotta do, right? We have to get groceries and wait in long lines. I have to do these things because i must. 
Idk guys. Sry to vent. Dont get me wrong im no piece of cake myself and surely have alot of flaws. But i love my family but i just cant get the thought of driving into a wall or whatever out of my mind. I even started looking into life insurance policies so if i died theyd be taken care of.
Idk. Im just tired guys. I joke about all the time. Thought about it since i was 16.
Im selfish lazy arrogant etc i know. Its just i cant talk to my family. They think its just another joke. But come on. A buddy of mine died of an overdose and instead of feeling sad, i felt jealous. Wrong right? Idk sry for the vent again",0
670,"I was a very hyper extroverted kid when I was younger and I loved it. 

I used to be the kid that ran around house parties dancing like Michael Jackson and telling jokes making my whole family laugh.

All the way from elementary school to the end of middle school EVERYONE knew me. 

I made everyone laugh, was constantly told I should be a comedian. Even people who I didn't know came up to me and said they'd want to hang out with me.

There wasn't a ***single*** kid in my school (quite large) that didn't know my name. Bullies even listened to me like I was the voice of reason. The popular girls would come to my house and grab me to hang out with their high school friends. I was liked by all the ""cliques"" and life was great.

Then, my grandfather died a few days before I graduated middle school. I graduated, skipped meeting up with all my friends, taking pictures, the after party and immediately left with my Mom to drive 4 hours away to take care of my grandmother. Who lives in the richest part of the US.

This is when my anxiety/depression started. My new school was much bigger, all the kids were rich and played sports, wore the nicest clothes, had awesome cars. I went from the most ""average joe"" school to the most preppy jockish school ever.

My parents are divorced, so my mom couldn't afford the fancy clothes the school was wearing. I sat alone at lunch every day, or hid in a cranny in some hallway rather than going to lunch at all. 

I hated my life. I had to see a doctor for medication. I was 14 at this time, and the doctor decided Xanax was the way to go. So I took it not knowing what it was, or how addictive it was, or how it made you act annoying and stupid. 

I kept the bottle in my backpack and took them ""as needed"" and by the end of the day I could barely stand up and I was slurring my words.

Jump forward a year, I'm a COMPLETE addict at 15. Trying new drugs, smoking cigarettes and weed. Still not talking to anyone in any classes.

My attendance dropped to 60% and I would go to school high on Xanax and weed. Going through every day like a zombie. Never leaving the house. I'd say if all throughout 4 years of highschool I said 1,000 words I'd be baffled.

My teachers clearly saw something was wrong with me, they'd talk to me privately and I'd explain my situation. My therapist would talk to my guidance counselor. 

Even though I did jack shit in school I guess the teachers felt bad and I managed to finish school with EXACTLY enough credits passing each class by the bare minimum.

Now I'm 23, still spend EVERY SINGLE DAY getting high on sickening amounts of drugs. My old friends are living their best lives, two of them have HOMES at 23.

I'm actually petrified of my future. I can't drive. I've never touched a girl. I had one job which took ALL of my courage to come in every day and I got fired for a mistake my manager made.

I take 16mg of Suboxone (to get off Oxy) every day, 75-100mg of Xanax, 3g of weed every day. I sit at the computer working on making money or playing video games, then I sleep.

I'm numb. I'm sad. The best years of my life have gone to waste. I can't face my family or leave my room during parties. I have 7 holes in my wall from getting too high and angry/depressed. 

I'm 5'5 as a guy, can't drive, only have 2 nice outfits which I haven't worn in years since I have no friends. I couldn't even go to my own cousin's wedding. 

To give you perspective, I used to play with this cousin constantly. We'd visit eachother and spend hours upon hours together. Now I can't even look him in the eyes. He has brought a wife to our parties for 4 years now and I haven't ever spoken to her one single time.

I'm so lost. I'm an extrovert stuck in an introvert's body. I truly believe I may never get out of this state because it's been this way from 14 to 23.",0
671,"I know I shouldn’t drink. I’ve tried to quit multiple times, but every time I just feel so bored and lonely throughout the day and night. I have severe IBS that makes it very hard for me to get out and socialise, and not drinking doesn’t seem to improve my symptoms at all (even after a few months sober). So I also drink to numb the discomfort of my symptoms.

673,"I feel as if I'm a star being sucked into a black hole all my light, my energy, my life being sucked into this inescapable darkness. A placid celestial body looking at the other stars and looking at them in jealousy drifting off into infinity, going somewhere. I feel as if I'm going nowhere stuck being forever drained in this black hole I call depression sucking my loves, passion, and my personality. I used to be passionate about things, such as violin and horror. I used to be able to practice for hours, I used to be really engaged into the horror community but I've lost interest in both of these. My violin playing is suffering, I used to strive to be in the Phoenix symphony; but my crippling self doubt and my lack of motivation has slaughtered that like a wolf to a baby lamb. Not only my performance in violin is suffering but so are my grades in school. Oh how I hate school, every single damn second feels the exact same as the last in which I feel would be better spent if they didn't exist, learning useless garbage such as how to find the area of a circle, immediately forgetting the material as soon as I walk out the exam room. I feel as if my 'friends' don't care about me despite there being no good evidence to support this. I wish I could come out and openly show my feelings, but i'm to much of a coward to so. I constantly contemplate suicide regularly, I just want all the tho it's to stop, I don't care anymore. I know I want to die. What's stopping me from doing it is the possibility that I survive. I will for ever look at myself as a failure who can't even kill themselves successfully, and the dissaproving eyes of my family under florecent lights in the emergency room. I cannot buy myself a gun because I am a minor, and even then, there's still a slim chance that I'll survive and left horibbly deformed. When I told my parents about my depression, they ridiculed me. Calling me a snowflake when not even using the damn insult right. Making the conversation about themselves, calling me entitled. They do not understand what depression is. All I really wanted, was empathy and help. I have not forgiven them for that and I probably never will. The one time I ask them of anything at the time when I need someone most they ridicule me. It boils my blood everytime I think of it. Now all I do now, I listen to music I used to have such passion for. And sleep. I'm trying my absolute hardest to keep going. They you it gets better, until you wake up a few hundred mornings later and realize nothing has changed. I hate the way I look, I can never satisfy myself with whatever I do. Whatever I try, until I just stop trying. I've given up on fashion, I do the bare minimum to look presentable in public. I don't know how to break free of this black hole before if completely consumes me. ",0
674," Before I start a little bit of background:

   I've been seeing a therapist for the past four years now and I've been off my medication for a little less than a year in order to see if I can cope without it. It's been going well, I don't feel a constant need to harm or isolate myself, but I feel ""off"".

  Unlike when I was depressed where I felt a good array of emotions from sadness, anger, and some degree of happiness I feel rather... Robotic. I don't know how to explain it to my therapist but I was hoping maybe someone else knows what I'm talking about? Where it feels like you aren't thinking despite having thought, where it feels like you have no emotion despite being able to laugh and cry and all that, and where it feels like you're numb for the most part.

&amp;#x200B;

 Before being taken off this medication I was extremely into writing, so much so I hoped to be a writer some day. I've been writing since I was twelve and it was my solace during my darkest of days and yet... I can't be bothered with it. It was my passion and yet I can't think whenever I try to write. 

  This goes for reading as well. I often have to reread every single page I look at just to comprehend what I've just read. It's like the words don't click in my mind, it's just a mass til I force myself to focus. 

  I have a hard time thinking in general, anymore. I have thoughts all the time but it's like I can't even grasp my own mind anymore. 

  

Does anyone else feel like this? It can't be withdrawal from the medication since it's been nearly a year now, so what on earth is going on?",0

677,"Ive been crying in public quite often recently. At work rn, and had a crying session in the bathroom

To anyone who wears makeup: sitting down and bending forward makes your tears fall straight to the floor from your eyes.

678,"So my wife and I have BP. She was going through a depressed state due to stress prior to the death and I tried to be supportive, get her mind off things and I still am. Yesterday was when we learned a really really close friend of hers passed from possible overdose, not sure if intentional or not atm. 

She had tried in the past to OD, and she is kicking herself she didn't reach out in the past when she had a feeling she should. I tell her she wouldn't have known this was going to happen. She agreed, but I know she's still upset at herself. It's really made her want to self harm again, and she's been a year clean of it, so I'm try to keep her mind off that at least, which makes it a little harder. 

I recently increased one of my meds, and it's like things changed even more than before when I was on a lower dose. My thought processes seem different and a little less foggy. 

 Since the increase I have felt like I need to use my new state to bring and build her back up. I have noticed though that although I feel like I'm being more supportive by just being there and not giving advice or saying things other then I'm sorry, and agreeing when she breaks down and says things like ""people don't die this young"" ""I was wishing it was a bad joke"" and that she just can believe he's gone. 

I feel like I can't really think of what to say, or do when she's breaking down, or saying some things. Saying she's fighting back tears, that it's not OK to cry or be emotional. I tell her it nothing to be ashamed of, that she lost someone that was a major part of her life and its a big deal. But she seems like she doesn't believe me.

I'm just being quiet, saying I know when she brings up things like it shouldn't happen etc. And just holding her and saying it's ok to cry, it's not a bad thing to.

I know things like ""gods plan"" ""he's in a better place"" and that bs doesn't help. I remember reading that there really isn't anything you can say when someone is in mourning to help. So I've kept my answers short and trying to enforce that what she's feeling and saying is true and real.

Other then that, and even though I've been depressed for so long, I just can't think of what to do or say to be supportive. Of her mourning, of her severe depression before and currently in this situation.

 I'm afraid that if I don't say something I'll come across as uncaring and not wanting to help, or that I don't want to hear or talk about it. I do, I want to help her and help take some of the burden, to be there. I just don't know what to do or say, what will help and what will hinder. I mean I think I know, I just don't know if it's a good idea. 

I'm trying to just be quiet, let her mourn, and just be there to hold her. But I feel like there should be more I should be doing.

Any suggestions on what to do/say? Is there more I can be doing? I'm just lost and I feel bad as I feel like I should know what I wanted said or done when I was depressed.

Lately things have been not okay but as close to it as I’ve felt in awhile, but it’s starting to get bad again. For some reason I can’t keep the thoughts away anymore, I can’t avoid thinking about what a failure I am, how I am the cause for my own depression and how I’m the one keeping myself from getting better.

During my 20 years of life the only friend I’ve had is an online one, this friendship has made a massive difference in my life, mostly good, but also bad. Things got rocky for awhile and I had lost my only friend, but they came back, it’s not the same though, I have a constant fear that I’ll run them off again and this fear keeps me from enjoying our friendship and keeps me feeling depressed even when I’m having a good conversation with them.

Having nobody else is extremely difficult, even more so since I don’t have anyone that I can meet up with in person and do things with. I am always incredibly lonely and miserable and I see no change in my future.

I feel so incredibly lost, my life, in my eyes, will never improve. It’s an awful existence but unfortunately suicide isn’t an option because I’ve seen how devastating it is for families and I love mine too much to make them suffer.",0

685,"I’m awful at writing but I think this might help me and maybe someone could give me advice as I don’t know what to do. I’m 21 so I haven’t ever done anything like this.

3 weeks ago I worked for dad and I have been for about a year now, but he’s not a very nice person to me and I’m not just saying that, he controls every aspect of my life, from the way I talk and act. Now I’m not scared or threatened by anyone really unless it’s mike Tyson or whatever but he actually makes me feel scared, like I’m nothing. He treats me like I know nothing. 

Now he doesn’t believe in depression, I got told last year, that I may be suffering with it, so I told him in confidence and the first thing he says is “never had that when I was your age” which annoyed me I guess. I fear him so much but a part of me wants to lash out at him. 

Now at work he just treat me like shit. Always has to put me down and all I want is him to be proud. Anyways so 3 weeks ago I lost my job with him as he’s greedy and wanted more money from people who give us contracts. We work in construction. 

But a month prior to this I’d just got my first flat with my girlfriend which was great! But now I feel like I’m going to loose it all. I’ve got no money as I’ve put it away for rent and bills, yet the old man is trying to get me to do my driving test, telling me how that money is no good sat in my bank. But I don’t want to spend any of it until I get a new job? 

But anyway about a week ago I’ve been really breaking down, I’ll go to the bathroom and burst into tears constantly, my heart is racing, I can’t sleep and I think I’m having suicidal thoughts. Like I’m not sure if if I’m serious all not because I’m always thinking about it, ever since I was quite young so not sure if it’s Just me being dramatic? I don’t know but I think I need help, just advice on how to deal with this. 

That job was literally all I lived for, it was a shit job but it gave me structure, it gave me a reason to wake up in the morning and it made me feel good. I’m worried about getting another job as I’m quite uneducated as when I was younger my dad made me believe that I wouldn’t need a education so I feel completely trapped and ruined by this man. I hate him so much. 

I want to keep you all updated on what happens next as right now I’m unemployed with a flat and extremely upset. I’m sorry if this is the wrong sub reddit just didn’t know where else to go. If your going to say anything mean just don’t, I can’t express how much I couldn’t deal with anymore negativity at the minute. 

So thank you to whoever reads all this, I’m going to try and sleep, I’ll reply in the morning!",0
686,I tried to OD Yesterday and I basically have had to spend the whole day in hospital feeling like Hell.  The worst part is the psychological strain.  Everyone at my school basically knows what I did and I think I'm going to get treated badly because of it.  Also one of the drugs I took was a deliriant so I can't remember what I did.  I remember taking the drugs but nothing after that.  So I think I made a fool of myself at school.

The few things keeping me from going through with suicide is the fact that I'd leave my little brother without any siblings, my mother and father would be devastated for life. I also always hold on for that little bit of hope one day i would just wake up and be a completely different person with a new outlook on life, so far I wake up and I still see myself in the mirror.

Lately I’ve been regretting a lot of things that has happened in my life (I’m only 16) and I’ve been doing terribly at school which makes me feel shit and then my parents are counting on me to do good at school and it’s to much pressure plus the constant bullying at school doesn’t help. I don’t know what to do anymore all of my ‘friends’ are now gone I have no one to talk to about my feelings so I sit in my room getting more and more depressed. what doesn’t help is that My ex has started to get everyone to call me useless and I’m honestly starting to believe them.Also I don’t know how to open up about my sexuality I am bisexual and whenever I’ve told people who I thought were my friends they just laughed at me and it makes me feel like I don’t even belong on this earth I hate my sexuality I wish I could be ‘normal’. I really need people I can actually talk to about how I feel I always put on an act when I’m around my ‘friends’ but it sucks I need to be able to let my emotions out to someone and I can’t exactly talk to my parents they wouldn’t understand and I wouldn’t want to trouble them with my problems.

691,"For anyone reading this post, Thank you. I just found this group today and it's been so helpful in making me feel slightly less alone. 

I'll start by saying that I have been dealing with severe depression and anxiety for 10 years now (I'm 24). It's always in waves and used to sort itself out eventually. I'm currently worse than I have ever been. I'm just so fucking exhausted and my anxiety makes me feel nauseous daily. I have seen multiple psychologist (one told me I would die like my mother in the first session if I touched any alcohol or drugs).

I try to go to the gym regularly, I have a trainer, I have a loving partner and a puppy. I eat relatively healthy and have a full time job. I'm doing my best and trying so hard but it feels like if I'm not happy now then I never will be. I start with a new psych in a couple of days and I feel like I'm just going through the motions to make people feel better. My boss told me to leave my emotions at the door and smack a smile on my face no matter how I feel and I'm so tired of faking it all fucking day that I get straight into bed as soon as I get home because I'm making people worried and uncomfortable.

My partner is so amazing and does his best to help me but he is a very positive person and it feels like I'm drowning and putting rocks in his pockets to drag him down with me.
It's becoming more and more apparent that this is it for me. And I feel like the worst most selfish person in the world for forcing my partner to be enduring this with me.

I guess I'm posting here because I just wanna know if anyone can help me. I'm so lost and I don't know how to help myself. I know no one can fix me but does anyone have any suggestions on what to try next?

705," 

I've been with my girlfriend for nearly 6 months now. She has severe clinical depression and has been hospitalized for it in the past. When we first met, she was in a better state and the relationship was pretty amazing by all means. She had even told me she felt me being in her life was improving her condition.

Over the last 2-3 months, her condition has steadily deteriorated and she has become very distant. She has also returned to therapy. She told me she wants to take a break from the relationship as she feels its overwhelming her. We sometimes go days without texting and even when I occasionally initiate, I don't get a response.

Despite her depression, she has so many qualities in her that I absolutely love and when she was in a better state of mind, we could often talks for hours without a pause. I would really like to maintain this relationship as I do care for her deeply and I do see a future with her. For those of you in a similar situation or those of you suffering from depression, how would you approach this? Is there a way to be proactive about the relationship other than just leaving her alone for the time being?

706,"Do people without this *stuff* ever actually understand how it is to have no motivation at all to do anything? Sometimes I don't want to even wake up, it's too much effort. I don't have it in me to keep up with what is expected of me and it just causes a somewhat complicated feedback loop of stress as i get more stressed because my grades fall and i cant keep them up, which causes me to be more abusive to my friends, which causes me to get more upset with myself and more stressed and for my friends to become more distant, which just causes me to be worse. 

I just want to stay on call with my best friend, and not get out of bed. I just want death. I can't stop fantasying about suicide and I'm getting tempted to bring rope to school and hang myself in the forest that surrounds it. I don't know what to do anymore my emotions and thoughts are a mess and I can't even sleep in peace anymore as I get nightly nightmares, often multiple a night, all about torturing and killing my friends or me burning. The good ones are the ones where I burn my house down, when I have those I don't wake up to a panic attack. 

I'm getting a reoccurring nightmare where I torture and kill my two best friends and the worst part about it is I somewhat like it. Not the actual torturing and killing, I don't think, but the feeling of control and power, the abusiveness. It feels like I was born to abuse and I don't want to, I can't but my mind keeps begging me, forcing me to abuse.   
I think that's an excuse, though. I control myself. I choose to be abusive to my friends, to manipulate and control them. I choose to be like this, I think. I hate myself for it, I won't forgive myself for it.

715,"In therapy group at the hospital they showed us this educational video from PBS where they discuss emotion, psychology, and the brain. In the video they interview this professor who wrote a book called “Why Zebras Don’t Get Ulcers.” It brings up the idea that humans are the only living things with such complex emotions and because of this we dwell and ruminate and it takes a toll; a Zebra, however, can go from eating grass to escaping a lion attack, only to happily go back to eating grass again once safe as though nothing happened. I thought this was really interesting and it brought with it the motto: Be a zebra. When you’re attacked by life, as hard as it is to let it go, if you can be a zebra and move forward leaving the negative experience in the past then it’s not as terrible. I don’t know if that makes sense to you but it really helped me. It’s also important to remember that as painful and difficult as it can be to simply be human, it can also be so beautiful and incredible.

&amp;#x200B;

I am 23, going to turn 24 next month, and I sort of had an epiphany today. I was helping my youngest sibling with choosing classes for high school and realized if I ever move out she'll be stuck with my dysfunctional, divorced and sociopathic parents.

  
My sibling is tougher than me and my parents are way more stable then I was a kid so I don't think they'll end up like me. All socially stunted, anxious and constantly stressing themselves. I am fine with staying here to take care of  them since most of the time I'm the only adult in the house watching over them. Plus I have nowhere else to go really.

&amp;#x200B;

But that thought sort of cemented what I've been frustrated about.

  
To be honest, I pretty much wrote all of my life story here by accident and deleted it. I'll just go over the backstory relevant to my current predicament instead.

  
I've been emotionally abused since I was about 5. My father cheated on my mother repeated and abused her mentally as well to the point where she had BWS and was devastated when he up and left. She took me and my siblings to another city closer to her hometown, which she avoided out of the shame of knowing the people there knew my dad slept around with people there, and was incredibly unstable for about two years. I took care of my siblings throughout that time but recall little of it because I have a poor long-term memory due to trauma. I had no idea I was depressed throughout pretty much all of my childhood until college where I learned about emotional abuse  and started to look into my past because I was suspicious I was a victim of it along with some physical abuse. I wasn't beaten to bad though, I mean I never broke a bone or anything. I only feel I need to say that because I recognize some people here must have gone through worse and I don't want anyone to confuse any of the little bit of pain I went through with the horror other have endured. I believe have just always been a weak idiot, that's why a few beatings sunk into me pretty badly.

&amp;#x200B;

Around the age of 5, pretty much every member of my family recognized that I was a new person overnight. I went from loud, grouchy and a pretty mouthy kid to the way I am now. Timid, nervous and unconfident. I had a lot of trouble dealing with being away from my siblings, stress from college and dealing with learning about my childhood (well really ongoing) emotional abuse. I got very very low but never made an attempt, I called the hotline one night where I was so upset I was pretty much just thinking of why not to do it. I was calmed down by venting to someone and struggled to make it through the last two months of school, and two full summer classes I needed to take due to my depression making it hard to attend classes. I wanted to just drop out but after talking with my mom she convinced me to at least try to stay in.

&amp;#x200B;

After that I came home and make very, very little money doing writing commissions. I didn't care about how little money I made or work I got. I just needed to cut myself off from all the crap that made me so depressed. I started taking medicine and slowly got better.   


Two years passed and I stopped taking the medicine, with my doctor's permission, and have been relatively good. I mean I don't want to die as much but I really feel pathetic.

&amp;#x200B;

I just can't believe I'm going to turn 24 next month and I made no progress, all that shit I went through  was for nothing. I lived and got that degree but due to me being a depressed piece of shit I never did a thing with it and I'm just wasting my life.

&amp;#x200B;

I serious question why I didn't just die in that apartment. It would've been the best way to get back at everyone who made me feel so damn worthless. My parents care about me in their own sick way, they truly do and I can see it but they are so damn cold. Part of me wanted to just let go of everything up there to make them suffer like I suffered but then my siblings would've been devastated.

  
My little brother and sister would be stuck with the short-sighted, outdated, bumfuck jackasses I call parents. So, in the end I don't regret living. I just feel like a damn idiot. The worst part is my family likes me being here. Because I'm here my mom can work longer shifts to support the middle sibling go to college (since my father in his vast wisdom deemed the middle child too stupid for college and refused to help when he put a damn failure like me through) knowing I'm watching my sister and maintaining the house since my mother just literally sleeps and works. My mother cares, I know that, just the way she can tear into my siblings just infuriates me. It's nothing like when I was a kid since my dad isn't telling her what to do but the little glimpses what they used to do to me being said my siblings makes my blood boil. 

&amp;#x200B;

I am not sure what I should do. I never got a real job and I can't work anywhere locally due to me being unable to drive. I live in shit hick city so we don't have any real public transit or anything. Looking for online jobs has been difficult and pretty stressful too so I usually just give up mid-search and just keeping doing more of the same. Maintain house, fret over making commission deadlines, make shit money, give 95-98% of money over to pay for the computer I use to make shit money (due to me being clumsy) and repeat.

&amp;#x200B;

After thinking about it, I wanted to get one more thing off my chest. One thing I forgot to mention earlier about college was that I learned just the slightest movement would force me to unconsciously cower and shake in public. As I got more depressed and recalled my trauma it was almost like the muscle memory of how I dealt with physical abuse as a child returned. It was so embarrassing, if anyone reached past me or walked to close I'd just shiver and recoil away violently. I couldn't even speak for about a minute when I would get like that. I started walking to classes on lesser used, longer paths so I wouldn't risk bumping into anyone. Even just being looked at by somebody made me sick and want to hide my face. I can't believe I almost forgot about this since I don't do this anymore. I was so pathetic.

&amp;#x200B;

Damn, this whole post is all over the place. I make little sense when I get emotional so I apologize to anyone who read this. Feel free to say whatever you're thinking. Even if you think I'm whining like a jackasses I'm up for it. Just explain how you came to that conclusion. I kind of want someone else to pick my mind.  ",0

i wish people would stop telling me to move on. i dont think anyone i know understands how i feel. and im not just trying to be angsty. i genuinely feel very lost in my mind. im constantly reliving all the shit that broke me down to my lowest points in life.

Therapy was a better experience as a teen. I also feel like I could talk about my problems more openly because people like to help high school kids more then they like to help adults.

However, I hate that I can't see this as an opportunity. I can't be happy about it. I can't get myself to go to the gym or my classes. English 250, Math 166, CprE. I'll lay in bed for hours on end waiting for the smallest sliver of motivation telling me to get my ass up and be productive. But by then, all of my classes and times to be productive are past me. I cant get myself to eat. I'm lucky if I eat a meal a day sometimes. 

I'm crying as I write this, not knowing if I should feel sorry or mad at myself. I keep saying, ""I gotta change"" and, ""Tomorrow will be better."" It's not. It never is. I know I am stupid to think that everything will just slide into place, I know it won't. Little by little is the way to go. But I am past that point. Everything moves too fast for a little to be a lot. 

My girlfriend is the best person in the world and is always there to help and listen. I could never leave her. She is so kind and caring. I am afraid that my depression is hurting us, though. 

I really just want to be happy with myself. I've done counseling through my university, I've tried exercises and routines that should help and I have been on heavy medication. I don't know what box to fill out under the ""Do you have any disabilities"" question on campus surveys and job paperwork.

736,"There are three major things in my life at the moment: School, relationships, and my sport. Last semester I went through a breakup that was really rough on me. I began to feel very unimportant and undesirable and being depressed then really hurt me in school. I began to lose all focus and ended up doing so bad that I was put on probation from my major, meaning if I do bad again I will get kicked out. All while this was happening I had an escape into the club sport I play in college. I'm the captain of my team and love going to practice and helping and seeing my team get better.

&amp;#x200B;

Fast forward to this semester, I moved on to a new relationship, that isn't really official, but I worry about it all the time. I don't have any real reason to, I just sit and sulk in bad thoughts, thinking that this girl is going to leave me at any time now. All of my classes this semester are follow ups to the classes I took last semester, so I need to spend extra time to catch up on these, and sitting around worrying about nothing does not help. I've fallen so behind this semester that I am beginning to do poorly in school again, and am worrying about getting kicked out of my program.

&amp;#x200B;

My sport has a national event every year which we send an all star to. Being the captain, and from me thinking I am the best on the team, I was thinking I was easily going to be voted to represent our team, but I did not receive one single vote. This felt like a blow to my heart and honestly something that hurt me way more than it should have. I put in way too much work to not be representing our team in front of the whole league.

This happening to me just feels like too much and I don't know how to find the motivation to keep studying and pushing forward. I know that I need to work but whenever I try I get surrounded by negative thoughts and feelings.

My life wasnt always terrible it was ok up until i was 13 years old i noticed cuts on my friends arms they never wanted to talk about them i figured out the reason and that day i realized why they did it i went home found a knife and started scraping skin off my left arm by dragging the blade across my arm repeatedly eventually i began cutting and it got worse and worse met a girl who knew my issues i fell for her but we ended up splitting it tore me apart had a few others along the way nothing really serious all long distance aswell then i met her we will call her sarah she changed my entire life made me into who i am she saved my life multiple times we were inseparable i loved her to hell and back things were great we talked everyday all hours of the day we had so much fun lots of memories we were also very intimate i thought i had it all she was perfect in my eyes but i guess i was blinded to see that we did in fact have a few issues but she never communicated them to me and she tells me we broke up due to distance but i still believe it was more also because when she snaps at me she tends to tell the truth about how im lazy or how i wouldnt get a job no matter what it was really hurts when she says all this but its pretty true and she knows im kinda sensitive so i just feel as if she was yelling at me and she knows i hated it after we broke up i was in so much pain then the day things started to really fall apart it wasnt even month after we split we we just finshed fooling around and i got a message from someone on kik saying that i needed to leave sarah alone and that i was upsetting her so still on call with her i asked her who this person was we will call him tim she then hung up and i messaged her and kept calling her eventually she answered and asked me what i i ended up finding out shes been talking to tim since we broke up they met in a group chat and then eventually started dating not even a month after we split this is the most pain iv ever been through it killed me inside knowing she was with another guy especially so fast like was i that easy to replace?

744,"Hi all, I hope the day is finding you well. 

Ok so, my depression comes and goes. And today has been so bad. I feel like I want to die, but know deep down I couldn’t ever do that to my family, even if they kinda treat me like an afterthought most of the time, I know this would destroy them, so I just sort of exist and hope my mood stays stable (which is not to say a good mood, just not a catastrophically bad mood). 

Today I was driving to work (a career which I feel very trapped in, and don’t like too much, but hey that’s life), and I find myself almost wishing for an accident to happen to me so I have a legitimate reason to be so upset.

I’ve almost gone to a psychiatric hospital before, but they said unless I’m thinking of self-harm, there’s not much cause for going and I should just schedule a regular appointment somewhere. I’ve tried therapy, tried multiple meds, hated them all. Therapy was just weird because I can so easily fool anyone into thinking I’m perfectly functional and I hate opening up to people because it’s burned me so bad in the past. 

I feel like I just want to give all my stuff away and walk away from my life and go live alone somewhere where no one knows me, because it’s almost more painful to be so close to loved ones and still feel so alone. 

I’ve tried picking up new interests or even aligning mine with people who show zero interest in anything I’m into, just on the off-chance they may return the gesture somewhere down the line. For example, I am so bored by sports, but a friend watches football religiously, so I try to pretend I’m into it and spent a couple years worth of weekends really making an effort to go over and watch it, only to have him basically turn down any ideas I’ve ever had. Now my job doesn’t allow for that(irregular schedule) and now I don’t talk to him regularly anymore. 

I mean, I could go on and on, but basically, I feel like no one is there for me, and if I want some semblance of a social life, I have to just tag along with whatever they were going to do anyways. 

No one makes time for me and when I confide in someone about it, they basically tell me that it’s all in my head and I just need to get over it and say yes more. But I tried that, and it results in lots of time invested in things I don’t like very much, and no return gestures. Even when our hobbies/interests align, they will tell me no because theyre all doing their own things.

I (f26) am now at home about a year, I'm not working or stuff like that.  
Most of the time I sit at home, play games, watching Netflix or videos, or writing with my friends and my boyfriend - to be honest, they're the reason I'm still here.  
Short summary, I nursed my mother my whole life and moved out in November 2017, there is only a bit contact that is more toxic than helpful, and she never accepts that I'm suffering from Depression, eating disorder, combined peronality disorder, and other stuff. For her.. SHE is the one with issues, not me.  


Some days it's so hard for me to even get up and buy something to eat, and the other stuff... I'm ignoring letters, I really have to go to the jobcenter, I want to move to another city, I have to do more at the household, but.. I do nothing.  
I am afraid. I am afraid to go to the jobcenter, that they're angry at me that I ignored the letters nearly a year, I am afraid to search an apartement, I see what I have to do, but I ignore it.   
I did therapies and do ergotherapy, I always take my antidepressants, and.. I want to change things. I try to plan my day, but then I think ""yeah, I can do it tomorrow"" - and that changes to next week, month, and so on.  
When I have motivation to do things, I do a fraction of that, then I'm exhausted and stop with that.  
I want to move on, I want to work again, I want to be there for my cats and friends, I want to have a normal life, but... everything fails, and when someone says he'll help me, I always say, I can do it on my own ;\_;  


How I can motivate myself? How can I be confident enough, how can I stop being afraid to change my situation? I really have no idea ;\_;

 And knowing from my parents and sibling (all with worse hearing than me) that hearing aids don't even bring you up to par with average hearing, and it's a difficult adjustment because hearing aids aren't sophisticated enough to filter sound like the human ear…I just don't want to do it. I don't want to get tested and find out just how hard of hearing I am. I don't want to wear hearing aids forever. I'd rather die, honestly.

This is something that needs changing. It is more than ok for someone with diabetes to be comforted even when they deliberately let their blood sugar go too low, and then be looked after by people around them. (This was one of my co-workers) but when I struggled with low mood I was told ‘we all have days like that’ ... ‘don’t let customers see you unhappy or uncomfortable’ 

This is an issue with how subjective everyday anxiety and a chronic mental health issue is, if someone does not understand the effort it takes to behave normally they will default to judging you based on how they deal with it. 

Of course it’s not all bad, I’m lucky to have family and a handful of friends that have seen me go though treatments and recovery so know the full spectrum of my issues and do not judge or baby me.

It has resulted in shitty sleep, loss of appetite and libido, hair thinning, and pretty bad depression. Also a big thing was it got so bad that I would feel nauseous and would start gagging.

I started going to counseling in October and meditated a bit. I didn't really feel like it was doing much at first. But then I started to notice that after I would have a really shitty anxious day, I wouldn't feel like absolute shit for the next week. I would actually be able to mentally recover after only like 3 days, and would be able to put myself through this hell again. I then started group counseling as recommended by my counselor, and saw how I wasn't alone. We all talked to each other and it made me a bit more comfortable talking to people. Then an injury I had for a long time finally healed and I started working out again. After a couple months of that, mixed with exposure exercises instructed to me by my counselor, as well as mandatory exposure such as group presentations etc, I can say now that I don't feel nauseous all the time anymore.

My anxiety has lessened recently – only one exam left and I’ve had just one panic attack all week. I’m actually okay for once. I’m starting to handle myself.

And I know how naive it must sound, but I am so very excited for the years to come. For university, where I want to double major in linguistics and Latin or literature and take as many courses that I can about everything that I love. I hope that I can rent a tiny studio and fill it with cheer and art supplies and candles and plants. For once, the future feels warm and close.

I picked up my coloured pencils again today and started drawing. It feels so lovely to let myself do that.

The world is becoming rosier. I’m just hoping that it stays this way, at least for a little while.

They started in January, and probation period lasts for 6 months but since then they had been taking a lot of days off and was always late.

For the longest time I have forced myself into interacting with others and socializing because I have sucked at it but I am pretty good at it now and can make conversation pretty easily and have always felt so nervous around others and afraid and I still get quite afraid but I am not so afraid as to put on a act anymore.

&amp;#x200B;

I just feel like I don't have that much innate energy within me. I can't care enough anymore to try and put myself out there and try and force out questions on how people were doing or how their weeks going. Like I don't get how people have the desire to go hang out with others and be perfectly content and be energetic? I want friends I really do but at the same time what I would naturally do is just be by myself all the time. I thought giving less fucks about what people think would make me happier but really it's just made me boring and annoyed.

&amp;#x200B;

Is this what depression feels like? What am I doing wrong? I really just dont get it anymore. I have the easiest life ever so why am I so drained of energy? Why is my outlook on life so negative? 

&amp;#x200B;

Do you guys feel like every interaction you have with another human being is forced? I have come to the realization that the past 4 years no interaction with anybody has been genuine. It's all about what I get out of it or what it means for others. I don't actually care about my friends or the people around me I met I only care about how I look and I am just losing the energy to try and interact with people anymore.

Does anybody else feel this way? How do I bring back that energy? Why do I get so caught up in my feelings?",1

I am a pretty healthy person- 33 years old, good shape, no history or any major health issues, same with my parents and grandparents.

&amp;#x200B;

It all started with my stomach in late Jan/early Feb. Acid reflux, pain, etc. I convinced myself I had stomach cancer. Ended up getting an endoscopy, which showed everything was fine. Stomach issues went away a few days later (surprise). All blood work has been normal, as well as BP. Lately I have been dealing with tension headaches (which I have convinced myself at times is a brain tumor, even though I have no other symptoms of one). They start in the afternoon, and usually affect my temples, forehead near nose, and top of head (sometimes back). One thing I have realized in that I am clenching my jaw a lot during the day, and am unknowingly tensing my throat and chest at times. All of this I think is contributing to the tension headaches. My question here is what are some things I can do during the day to prevent the jaw clenching and cheat/throat tensing?

34,"Hi there, new to this sub.

I've been dealing with something these past few days and maybe someone here has had it or something similar and can offer advice on how to overcome it.

It's very hard to explain as its happening in my own mind so nobody would know exactly what's going on but I'm gonna do the best I can 

Basically during the day I sometimes get this thought that tells me I cant be happy. It could be at a low moment or a moment when I'm actually in fact happy but its just a thought ""you cant be happy"" and it makes me unhappy instantly. So weird. Now generally I am able to distract the thought right away and I could brush it off, I've known about this for a few years now and it's never been that big of an issue.

 But during one of these thoughts 3 days ago, I wasn't able to brush off this thought, tried to argue with it and it weighed on my mind, I kept trying to deny and suppress the thought and it only got worse and it felt like it got more powerful.

 Now, I've tried a few different techniques that have worked temporarily like telling the thought it has no power over my mind and that I just have to believe I have dominance over my mind and I can be happy and these often work for about 5 minutes to 30 minutes but then I get the thought again and it takes control. I try to distract myself by thinking of other things about my life but the thought always comes up and sometimes even stays and I cant distract myself from it even when thinking other things. I've tried ignoring it altogether when it comes up but that usually just feels worse because then it starts actually working and controlling my mind. Lately, the thought has been coming back again and again nonstop. 

When I keep trying to think positive, smile or drown it out with different thoughts, it gets exhausting and I start to feel trapped in my mind, like everything around me is harder to process.

Music, Youtube videos, Netflix, reading and meditation helps me a lot with this during my down time and it only really happens during the day. In the morning and at night I'm pretty good.

 But I cant have this all the time during the day when I'm out and about. When I'm walking from place to place and stuck with nothing but my own thoughts is when it's the worst. Also I dont want to just distract myself, I'd rather conquer this altogether rather than keep suppressing it

Advice on how to deal with this? It's only been going on for a few days and I definitely wanna confront it right now before it gets any worse. I'm also open to doing therapy if its needed

45,"Hi. My name is Dimitris. I am 28 years old living in cold Canada. 

I was a happy teenager when I lived back in Greece. Thats when it happened. My mom suddenly passed away when I was 15. I was in shock. My world crumbled and I went into hardcore anxiety. I developed panic attacks and major health anxiety due to my mom's passing. For years and years I would be scared that everything that I would do, somehow, they would cause my death. Either by stroke, heart attack, sleep apnea, you name it - I had it. 

I moved to Canada when I was 24. I still had the panic attacks and health anxiety for all those years. Nothing helped. I didn't want meds so I just let it ruin my life. I was a husk inside my own body. My girlfriend helped me by being there when i had major panic attacks but that would not solve the problem. 

Thats when I decided it was about time for me to take control of what I lost all those years. I found a personal trainer that was very sympathetic with my problem and we worked slowly for months and months to force my brain to desensitize my normal body feelings. After a whole year it was done. 

Now we are here. 2019. I am still alive. I am still going strong. Sometimes I have panic attacks and health anxiety but its not part of my lifestyle anymore. I can run. I can go to the gym. I can go hiking. I can go to the club.  I can finally be free.

There is no relief, there is no end in sight, and I am so tired and pissed off and scared of the future and scared that this feeling will never go away. I'm projecting my anger onto other people and starting to hate my sister, my mom, my boyfriend just for not understanding what I'm feeling or for not even asking. Sometimes I feel depressed but lately I'm feeling straight up pissed off. Like why can't I just live my life and enjoy it even a little bit? Why must every second of every God damn minute of every day be filled with senseless, baseless, intrusive, nagging anxiety? Why the hell am I like this? I would love it for someone to just say, You're trying. You're doing good. You're going to be alright. Some acknowledgment.

57,"Hey guys, so my girlfriend and I have been together for about a year. We both identify as lesbians, but I have been with men in the past. Well yesterday we were talking about sex toys and she asked me if a penis felt the same way inside as a dildo. I told her it was relatively the same and I asked her why she wanted to know, and she told me she was just curious since she has never had sex with a man before. I then asked her if she has been thinking about it because she wanted to have sex with a man, and she said no, she was just curious to ask how it felt since she has never had that experience. She said she wonders a lot of things like how it feels to get shot or stabbed or to do drugs, but she never actually wants to do any of those things.

69,"I have no life skills. I have horrible anxiety. I’ve never worked a job, no one wants to hire me and I’m terrified of getting myself into something I can’t handle. My life has barely even started and I already don’t see a good future for myself. Literally the only reason I haven’t just killed my self yet is because I don’t want to make my mom sad and the thought of having to face the wrath of god for all the shitty things I’ve done in my life doesn’t seem too pleasant either. 

I have no skills and I’m fairly certain I’m too unintelligent and low functioning to make it through college or any kind of training. I’m absolutely horrible at math, or just working with numbers in general, so being a cashier is hardly an option for me because if I fuck up and someone yells at me I might just end up killing myself right then and there. I can’t handle conflict. 

I feel like the few things I enjoy in this life would make unrealistic careers. I like painting but let’s be honest, how many people aspire to be artists but go on to live piss poor lives because no one goes a shit about their art? I like nature but I can’t think of any nature related jobs I could possibly get. I’d love to just do charity work for a living but that kind of thing doesn’t exist. Charity and volunteer work take up money and time that I don’t even have. 

I always felt like if something were to happen to my mom I’d just kill myself. I don’t really want to die, but I think maybe telling myself that it’s my backup plan if I can’t improve my life in any way is significantly easier to handle than worrying about another option. Idk why I’m even posting this. I just wish something would change. I don’t know why everything is so overwhelming and I don’t know why I’m so afraid of normal shit people do everyday and don’t even think twice about. 

People always want to urge everyone to go therapist shopping and to hop on the long list of medications, which is fine for other people, but I’ve already gone down that road. I’ve had multiple therapists and I have never found therapy helpful other than the fact that is ruled it out as being helpful. The medications made me feel sick and had weird side effects. Plus I can’t just sit around for another few years waiting to get better. I can’t continue being such a financial burden on my family. I can’t live with the shame and the guilt. ",1

71,"Ever since I started using reddit a few days ago I've found that talking to people online in an anonymous way is a great way for me to talk about my problems (I have depression, a lot of anxiety, have trouble socializing, have lack of confidence, suicidal thoughts, and the list goes on and on) without fearing what the other person thinks of me.

I've found that even though anonymity is seen as something bad since people who don't know anything about you can say horrific things about you without ever showing their faces, it can also help people with social anxiety talk to others without feeling as anxious or worried about what the other may say or think about you.

The reason why I'm writing this post is so that anyone who is going through hard times, or just wants someone to talk to, can talk to me in an anonymous fashion by sending me a private message through this app/site.

74,"Want to hear your thoughts.

So, you have anxiety/depression, but that doesn't make you a problem. I think for most people having A/D is totally reasonable, for example, if you go out into a social situation and there's a few dicks there that make you feel uncomfortable, or you have issues with your safety, or something happens that scares you, of course you're then going to be worried about going out into social situations and you're going to feel anxious about it... As would anyone in that situation!

Same with depression. If you're X age, still haven't achieved what you want, still haven't got a relationship you want, still hate your job, can't buy a house etc then OF COURSE you're going to feel depressed about your situation and that's natural because you feel dowm about your self perceived lack of accomplishment. This is NORMAL.

I don't think the way to fix these issues is to go on meds and practice a tonne of self care to make yourself feel better short term. Surely, you need to gently expose yourself to your triggers, slowly, until they become less triggering over time, etc.

For depression, you need to surely try and change your situation. I don't think it's unreasonable for someome who (by their measure) has a shit life, to then be down about it? So surely the best thing is to take small steps to change certain bits and keep going, etc.

I just feel like meds and short term self care (candle bath, gratitude lists) will just make you feel better chemically, but not fix the cause of your actual issues which TOTALLY JUSTIFY why you feel anxious/down.

Does that make sense? Idk. Just trying to say most A/D cases are totally fucking justified and the way out is to take small steps towards what scares you. I've had people close to me just take meds and have baths and never make an effort to fix the circumstances that gave them their JUSTIFIED feelings. Downward spiral much?

81,"^Possible ^TW: ^self-harm ^talk

I've struggled with anxiety most of my life. As a kid I was always called a ""worry wart"", I had bad anxiety and depression in high school, and then I got worse in university. 

Now, somehow, I survived university. I had big ups and downs. I had some successes and made some serious mistakes. But ultimately I survived.

After university, I worked part time and really focused on getting better. And I did. I'd had a *lot* of anxiety around education, particularly assignments. And some of that anxiety would turn into self-harm when I felt overwhelmed with it. But once I stopped studying I was able to untangle from those triggers and function okay in my job.

It's been about 3 years since I last studied. I'm now working full-time. But recently I decided to do a grad certificate related to my job, but only one unit at a time (you know, for that work-life balance, making smart choices for my mental health...)

Well, my first assignment is due Monday. It's been a huge challenge. My teacher called it a ""trial by fire"" for those of us who are cross-discpline students. 

But today I had my first ""failure"" for the course. (Which I know isn't really a failure, but it felt like it.) Where basically I missed the deadline to get feedback on about 1/2 the assignment (ran out of time to submit a draft).

And I know it's completely irrational. But as the deadline got closer and closer (and later at night) it felt like the world was closing in on me. I was instantly irritable. Every sound made me want to smash my head into a wall. My head was full of unclear thoughts. It felt like glass was in my ears. Every sound was magnified and screaming at me. I started hurting myself: pinching, scratching, biting, punching myself. I just wanted anything to make it stop.

I feel like such garbage. I just want to scream.

I can't believe that one assignment is all that's between me and self-harm. Can it really be that fucking small??

I haven't even failed the assignment! What the fuck is wrong with me? I get a little bit overtired and miss out on something small, and suddenly I'm 3 years ago and I feel like I'm actually going insane??

I did eventually find an incompatible activity for self-harm to help snap myself out of it. (It's kinda dumb, but plank exercises worked for me? Makes me tired and I have to tense and relax between each set.)

But I'm so annoyed and upset at myself. I should be better than this. Why does everything fall apart over something so not worth falling apart over? Ahhhh!!!",1
82,"Hello, I’m a longtime lurker, first-time poster. 

I’m in my last couple months of school, and I’ve been suffering pretty badly with my anxiety so I was recently put on medication to help me get to the end and then my plan is I’m going to come off them and do CBT over the summer. 

I try not to take the meds unless I need to, though I do end up using them most days. 

I’ve been taking them daily at the moment as this week I’ve been doing my first real exam spread over the week (because it’s so long) and I really struggle to stay calm in exams without them. 

Today, I slept in, and forgot to take one.

Because I’m in sixth form I get free periods, so I slept in my car through the first two hours of the day (my frees) and forgot to take it again. 

So I went to my exam and realised I hadn’t taken it because I started shaking. They take about an hour to kick in so taking one then would have been pointless anyway. So I did my best and got that part of the exam done, without getting too stressed. To be honest, I’m not sure how I managed to pull it off, but I did and I’m pretty proud.

But that wasn’t even the spectacle of today.

I had work tonight, and an hour before my shift started, I was leaving school, when I tried to turn my car on and it wouldn’t. Basically, I’d been listening to music without the car running and had the AC running, and killed the battery. 

Luckily, I’d had the window down so my boyfriend could talk to his friend in the car next to us, and he heard my car sputtering when I tried to turn it on and stayed to help. 

My boyfriend and his friend ended up pushing my car up and down the car park twice with me trying to bump-start it (which didn’t work) and then a teacher came out who luckily had cables and after about six attempts, we managed to jump-start it. 

I didn’t even get a single tear-prick, god knows how. I usually can’t deal with anything if it’s going to make me late for work. I have a huge fear of disappointing people and usually even the prospect of it sends me spiralling into a panic attack. But somehow, I managed to stay chill, and it actually really helped us all be productive and work as a team to fix it. I doubt if I’d lost it I would have gotten to work on time. 

So we managed to get it going again, and I was able to get to work *early*, med-free, and without a single tear. 

I’m gobsmacked, and so so happy. I’m riding the high from today, something I haven’t felt in years. To a lot of people out there, yeah, sitting an exam and having your car battery die is stressful, but for my anxious self without her meds it usually would have been the death of me. So today has been an enormous achievement for me, and I couldn’t have done it without all the help from my friends. 

I just needed to share my little achievement with you guys, so thanks so much for reading!",1
83,"I've always had wanderlust, and a desire to see things and do things out of the ordinary. Recently, things have been extremely tough for me and I'm thinking there's only a few ways out of this mess. Maybe some insight is what I need. I'll try to keep this short and sweet.

Details about my city - It is in shambles. Hypocrites, narcissists and criminals have made this city home, and I want to get away from it. And I'm not just saying that because I want to run; it really is a degenerate's playground. The environment and the people that live here are incredibly toxic. Even our mayor is under FBI investigation. The streets are filthy and of course, there are some wonderful areas but they often become overcrowded with beggars and gangs. Every night, you can hear gunshots and police sirens just outside your window.

Details about me - A year ago, I deleted all of my social media because I had an incident with revenge porn that left me shattered, and I didn't want people to find me online. Everyone in my high school at the time was sharing the pictures, and the comments would make you sick. I still walk into a room two years later and the thoughts consume me - ""Have you seen me naked?"" I was distraught and contemplated suicide for a while. The separation from social media certainly helped my overall mental health, and I have no desire to ever go back. I have lived in the present a little more, and have worked more towards maintaining healthy friendships. Deleteing Facebook made me appreciate the world, and those that have really impacted me.

You should know that I've been suffering for years, and my issues have been made worse after I was targeted. I have bipolar disorder, a monster of an eating disorder, PTSD from a sexual assault in my youth, anxiety (social), depression and basically, I'm a walking disaster. I carry myself with a smile constantly, though. I am warm and approachable with an incredible sense of humor. I am selfless and charitable. You wouldn't know that I'm teetering on the edge. I have no friends because I'm terrified of being close to anyone due to the revenge porn (they're making the rounds online again as of two weeks ago, and guess who's been crippled because of it?) and truthfully, nobody strikes me as being worth the effort. I am ironically hugely into motivational speakers and bettering yourself and finding peace in nature, hiking, etc. And I couldn't surround myself with people that I can't trust. Which is everyone. Because after a messy breakup with a best friend who claimed he browsed revenge porn sites for the thrill of recognising girls he knows, I feel I can't trust anyone. Especially men around my age.

Details about the situation - My uncle lives up here and he's cool. My mom fled domestic abuse and lives in the deep South. We don't talk much, and I have a deep resentment for her. And my father is nonexistent. The only person that keeps me here is my boyfriend. He's a good man. And I mean that. He is honestly one of the best people I have ever come to know. Leaving him is going to destroy what's left of me.

He's tried to get me into therapy and counselling and I failed at that because I can't trust the therapist enough to open up. Instead, I lie, which isn't helping anyone. He's trying so hard but I just want to GO. Run. And without social media or anything, the people harassing me with revenge porn won't find me, old aquanitances won't find me, nobody will find me. I just need to make the choice. Start over somewhere brand new and become the woman I KNOW I can be.

They say that your environment can impact your health and the city I'm living in is toxic. I don't want to run away and don't see it that way - I see it as an opportunity to restart and make peace with all of the pain I've endured. I have about 10k in cash, which isn't much but it's more than nothing. I have a Jeep that has enough space to comfortably sleep in for a short woman. I have very little belongings, no debts, no commitments other than a decent job and a boyfriend I know I'll regret losing. And an itch to get out of here.

I don't have a plan and don't want one. I just want to drive and get the *** out of here and become who I really am without fear of nude pictures disgracing me and shutting me down. What do you think, Reddit?",1

89,"So I've been on sertraline/Zoloft for my anxiety for around 4 years now. Just under a year ago, I decided to begin the process of coming off it, since I'm doing much better (yay!). Since then, I've dropped from 150mg to 100mg; 100mg to 50mg; and, most recently, 50mg every day to 50mg every other day.

&amp;#x200B;

Overall, the reduction process has been pretty smooth; I've noticed a brief dip in my mood each time I reduce the dose, but no physical symptoms. Until now, that is! Since dropping down to 50mg every other day, I've been feeling woozy, lightheaded, exhausted, and nauseous - usually on my ""off pill"" days.

At first, I panicked that I might be pregnant and maybe it was morning sickness, but I've checked multiple times and I'm not. This only really started when I reduced my dose again, so I'm fairly sure that this is linked.

Last year I got a tattoo from the streets without checking for safety. I got an HIV scare, started staying anxious all the time and soon developed a breathing problem. I couldn't breathe deeply. I couldn't yawn properly. That made me develop health anxiety. I consulted a lot of doctors and they all say that I'm physically ok. I have quit nicotine, THC, caffeine and have started eating properly. I started doing yoga and took up boxing. But a year later, the breathing problem persists. I tend to stay anxious but not all the time, the breathing problem although is persistent. Has anyone gone through something like this before?",1

102,"I have been diagnosed as having depression and anxiety since I was around 13. I am 28 now, and have never received help for it. I was originally in the US, and my doctor would refuse to talk to me about options, or to refer me to someone that could help. I probably should have tried a different office, because I saw several different doctors there that would simply tell me I have these things, and then do nothing. I felt helpless.

In 2017 I moved to a different country, which has caused my depression and anxiety to be on a whole new crazy level. I constantly feel like I am in ""fight or flight"" mode, and it is completely exshausting. The muscles in my body are always tight and hurting, and I am always fatigued. It has gotten to the point where I cannot leave my apartment by myself anymore. If I am with my husband, I am fine and can go outside no problem, but on my own it is a paralyzing fear. After *hours* of trying to fight through it, I have managed to go outside, and I am usually ok once I get out there, but I shouldn't have to psyche myself up for several hours just to go to the grocery store down the road. 

In mid-February I started taking a French class. It was just for 8 weeks monday-wednesday in the evening. For the first half I went to every single class, and I was so proud of myself. I thought I was *finally* overcoming my fears. Starting last week though it's like the door was shut in my face. I am right back to not being able to leave the house. I have missed several classes, and I am supposed to have a class tonight too. I want to go so badly, since there is just one more week left after this. By missing class I feel like I'm being judged by the people there, and I will just sit in my chair in a paralyzed state for hours just trying to force myself to ""suck it up"" and go. 

I am tired of living like this; it isn't sustainable. I am letting myself down, and even though my husband tries not to show it, I know I'm letting him down too. He doesn't understand the anxiety very well, so it seems silly to him at times, which makes me feel even worse. My family back in the US doesn't really know this is happening, since I'm keeping quiet about it. I have no friends either, so I feel very alone most of the time. I want to be able to have a job, to go out and meet people, to go to the grocery store without fear, to just *be normal.* 

A few weeks ago I made an appointment with my GP to find out who I should see for my anxiety and depression. None of the Psychiatres she is associated with know English, so it's up to me to find one. She did give me a paper, which I guess is sort of a referal, to give to whoever I end up seeing. I'm scared though. I'm afraid of not being taken seriously, or that my problems aren't severe enough to receive help. I know it's silly, but I still feel that way all the same. 

I'm sorry this is so long, but I have been holding this in for so long that it feels nice to get it out. ",1
103,"Of the many things that I dread, talking to younger children is definitely up there as one of the biggest. It first became apparent during my teens. I have two young cousins who live a long way away so I only see them once a year at most, and every time I saw/see them I'm so awkward - and to make matters worse my brother is always amazing with them. I recently got a job in a family friendly restaurant and of all the aspects of the job that challenge my anxiety every shift - unhappy customers, complaints, dropping things, messing up orders - serving children is the worst.

I just wanted to share some things I do after (if I have the energy) or before an attack (if I feel it coming on.) Feel free to share any suggestions you might have too :)

• Baths. I also try to add some nice smelling bubble bath or epsom salt. I heard epsom salt is good for anxiety, and I tend to feel quite a bit relaxed after using it, it may help you. 

•Coloring books, word searches, and crosswords. these are distracting and help focus your mind elsewhere. puzzles are also good. 

•Kids movies! this may sound a bit silly, but I am a huge fan of the movie Space Jam. I watch it often and for some reason it’s very distracting to me and it helps me feel calm. I’ve watched it so many times but I don’t really get tired of it. I suggest kids movies because they are simple and funny and tend to not deal with topics that cause anxiety ie. death and other scary stuff.

•Cleaning. Sometimes I will clean my whole house top to bottom because it helps me focus on tidying instead of thinking. I’ll look up cleaning hacks (also distracting) and learn new ways to make my space even cleaner. Having a clean space also helps you feel a bit more relaxed too. 

•Watching life hacks videos on YouTube. They’re quite interesting to me and give me something to focus on.

A couple weeks ago was my final session with my therapist (I can reapply, however I will get a new therapist and the per session payments aren't really in my budget right now). After that session I was feeling my most confident, I felt like I was equipped with the tools to make my life better and I was in a much better head space overall. Though, for the past couple days something seems to have shifted in me. I'm no longer actively looking for employment, I've given up on getting ready to apply for school and I don't really see the point in doing anything. The only joy I seem to get anymore is when I'm with my SO. I only see her once a week and this has been working for us for the past year and a half. The more I think about having to get a job, the more anxious I become. I know that I can't exist without having stable income, but I also fear the toll my mental health will take when I lose my free time. I have had a job before, but that only lasted a month due to my social anxiety whenever I'd have to interact with customers. When I was in a better head space I'd applied for just about everywhere that would take somebody with little to no work experience and if it isn't obvious, I didn't get hired by anybody.

I'm going to try and keep this short since it's getting hard for me to focus and I'd rather get it out of the way instead of simply closing my browser. Everyday I feel like I'm being backed into a corner about the entirety of ""adulthood"". Simply typing it out has made it seem silly and that it shouldn't be a concern because everybody goes through this phase. However, the fact that I am intentionally going out of my way to avoid any sort of responsibility is messing with me. I know I need to have a job and I know that I have to sacrifice my free time in order to get it, but my free time is exactly what keeps me in a positive head space.

115,"Hi redditverse,

I’m struggling with whether or not I want to have children. I’m late 20s female. I didn’t want them till someone I respect told me I’d regret it when I’m older and that for women, family is usually the centre-place of your life. All of a sudden I started questioning whether I want them or not, when all my life I was so sure I didn’t want them. I notice babies, children all the time in my life and in the media. It’s something I’m noticing a great deal now. My late 20s biological clock went off and all I want to do is hold a baby, and play with toddlers.

I’m so anxious about it. But I can’t separate whether I want them or not from all my fears. Fears of not having them and regretting it. Or fears of having them, not being able to afford them, being a bad parent, being stuck with the massive responsibility it is to raise them. Fears of not being able to find a partner that wants to be the co-parent, and becoming infertile before I get the chance. 

And to top it off my boyfriend doesn’t want kids, so the anxiety of do I/don’t I want them is heightened by the fears of having to leave the love of my life because our life goals would be incompatible. 

I also am in an entry level job so I don’t make enough to support a child AND save for their education + retirement. Wondering if I should just not worry about that and whether having kids is worth the financial sacrifice/burden. 

I’m an anxious wreck. I’m talk to two counsellors about it so far (am currently in therapy) and nothing helps! Any advice is welcome. My mind is all jumbled up. ",1

119,I’m not sure if this is part of my anxiety or not. I’ve always had very vivid dreams but especially taking anxiety/sleep meds my dreams only got more realistic. Some dreams actually make me mad at people. I’ve been mad at my boyfriend because of things that happened in my dreams! Is this normal? Sometimes in the middle of the night I’ll be confused after waking up and literally think I’m at work or something... I don’t know what’s wrong with me. I can’t even tell if some memories I had have actually happened or if it was just a dream. Not to mention my derealization for the longest time made my whole life feel like a dream. It is strange though that I can actually get mad at someone like they offended me over a dream but kinda think it’s real? Has anyone experienced this? ,1
120,"Sometimes I worry about how easy I make it for people to use me. You always hear people talk about the “languages of love”. I’m not sure it qualifies as one of the trademarked “languages”, but I believe that I show my love through giving (in any sense of the word, whether its giving gifts, giving sustenance, giving assistance, giving emotional support, giving affection, giving time, etc.). I’m not sure if this is something I naturally do as a way of showing love or if it was learned. That is something I really fear. Do I give everything I have to those I love out of fear that I, alone, am not deserving enough of receiving love in return? When I say it, it feels right. I don’t really love myself. I can pretend. I can feign confidence for short periods of time. Those moments feel good, powerful. But it is always fleeting and I always find myself back at square one: questioning my worth, comparing myself to others, repeating previously spoken words of criticism in my head over and over. I’m not sure I can blame the people who use me FOR using me. I make it so damn easy. In fact, I almost welcome it. At this point, it seems like it would be unfair of me to stop giving so much. But I give and give until I feel empty sometimes. I question sometimes whether or not I actually ever get anything in return for all my giving. This leads me to question whether or not these people I love and love giving to actually love me back at all. Maybe they just love being taken care of. Maybe they just love all that I can offer. And these thoughts, whether they are overblown and imaginary or they are true realizations, are what fuel this original thought that I’m not worthy of being loved if I don’t give as much as I do. ",1
121,"Sorry if this type of post has previously been made but I’d find any new perspectives helpful! 

I’m 24 and would say I’ve struggled with social and general anxiety for most of my life. I’ve never been diagnosed or medicated so I would say that I’m able to manage and function OK without. I keep thinking about all the missed opportunities and things that my anxiety has prevented me from doing and I wonder if it’s worth a shot to seek help and try medication. My life is good for the most part, I’m active and exercise frequently, I eat well, meditate, and have a supportive boyfriend, friends, family, etc. I just don’t feel like I’m able to be my best self a lot of the time. I’m extremely self-conscious and find that I just feel “off” some days. 

I can provide my background info if needed but mostly  I’m hoping people who have similar situations can walk me through the process of seeing a doctor to get a diagnosis and medication. Or for those of you that feel like being medicated hasn’t worked, would it be best for me to continue managing this on my own? ",1

I’m a 20 y/o female and I had written very personal things. Before I was on my Prozac I would get very jealous and almost paranoid because I love my bf so much and my anxiety was taking over me. I had written stuff that wasn’t true or I didn’t have proof of that I just assumed as if these things were true. Examples: my boyfriend thinks this person is better looking.. my boyfriend touches himself to this cause other people are better.. let’s just say really graphic angry things. I wrote this one time when I was pissed at my boyfriend and totally forgot I had written it. I know I sound very toxic and it was very toxic my jealousy and everything. I was diagnosed with anxiety a while before dating him and had stopped taking my meds. I’m back on meds for a few months now and me and my boyfriend have been so perfect. No arguing or anything. I am very happy with him. We both have been diagnosed with anxiety so we can relate to each other. Now my mom hates my boyfriend and thinks he’s an A hole because of what I wrote that wasn’t even true and just my assumptions. I am super embarrassed and I can’t eat sleep at night (I sleep all day when not working) and am just not myself. My depression (was also diagnosed with) and anxiety are overwhelming me.

  At point of desperation I began to seek my own alternative to my anxiety's ruthless attacks. After a few days of unlimited  searches, I stumbled across a list from depression.org titled: ""You can take the first step to enjoying life again"". Sounding exactly what I was looking for, I opened my mind and decided to read yet another list. Here is what I can pass on to you if you are suffering from Anxiety and Depression, parent-to-parent:

1. ""GO TO THE BEACH OR BUSH, LISTEN TO THE SOUNDS OF NATURE AND SMELL THE FRESH AIR"" 
I live in Texas, it's so dry the river only runs twice a week. However, fresh air is always relaxing. I join the kids outside, enjoying the sun as I watched my children bike around the neighborhood, releasing their crazed energy. Although they still fought, the meltdowns created by the sound of their bickering bouncing off the walls were on currently on hold.

2. ""GET OUT AND DO SOMETHING PHYSICAL, LIKE GOING FOR A RUN, WALK OR TO YOGA"" 
I felt this was just a reiteration of the first step, but I'm crazy so what do I know?! There isnt enough peace in my house to focus on yoga. Running or walking might work, though not alone lWith anxiety, you fear every person is watching you from their windows, mortified as you pass their house. Holding one child in my arms as you push another in the stroller, dragging a scooter behind. By the end of it you are craving the shelter of your home, your sanctuary from the outsiders judgements.


3. ""GET YOUR HANDS DIRTY IN THE GARDEN""
 Perhaps this relates to you, I cannot keep a plant alive to save my life. NEXT.


4. ""SLEEP IN YOUR BED (and not in front of the television)""
Most nights I fall asleep in the rocker next to the crib to offer relief to our babies pain from teething. Or even accidently as I tuck another in as they so sweetly ask me to lay with them. They might drive me closer to insanity, but I love them with everything I have. 


5. ""KEEP A BOTTLE OF WATER IN YOUR CAR OR HANDBAG""
These are really the BEST strategies we get?? Did common sense come with that degree? I do not mean to offend those who spend hours researching topics to write. But at least BELIEVE in what you write, and know the readers are people who seek real answers.

6. ""CUT BACK ON ALCOHOL AND RECREATIONAL DRUGS""
I can only dream of being able to enjoy and FINISH a glass of wine!

7. ""EAT HEALTHIER MEALS""
You got me. I do my best, but find it easier to settle for take-out at tines. However, our body and mind rely on proper nutrients in order to function correctly.


Bottom line, the strategies online are useless, repetitive and juvenile when up against such a dark force that detaches us from mental health. Follow me as I seek strategies for us parents, and together we will finally overcome!

I’ve had people tell me to “just open up and say what you’re feeling” but it’s difficult for me to start a conversation like that. People have also told me to say, “hey, I’ve been feeling anxious and I really need to talk about it,” and I think that’s the easiest way to start it but I still don’t like that as a conversation starter because I feel like if I say stuff like that, then I’m asking for attention and I’m not being genuine, even though I am.

136,"It's to make you feel less anxious only? Does it makes you more motivated, makes you feel like doing the things you used to again?",1
137,"Hi all,

Made a throwaway for this, because you never know, right?

&amp;#x200B;

So, where do I start... I'm sorry if this is all over the place, but I need to vent and kinda write down how I feel and what issues I have.

&amp;#x200B;

I've always felt like I was different than others. Social cues, etc, were never really obvious to me. I tend to overthink things, I don't get all jokes (I rarely make jokes because of this reason. Or maybe I'm just not funny?). Although I can joke around with my best friends...But in general I'm doing fine I guess? I think most people like me, although I've heard – when having those drunken conversations with friends and they become completely honest – that I'm definitely kinda... ""weird"" is how they described me.

As in, I'm not super ""normal"", and that's fine, but not everyone can handle that or can get along with me because of that.I definitely feel that: eye contact is not super easy for me with some people, especially not with strangers. Heck, I've been working at my new job for 10 months and I still have issues in keeping eye contact with my boss. It's super weird and kind of annoying... I get super self conscious about it and I start noticing my facial features. It's weird. We get along fine and I don't think he really notices it, but I find it annoying.

&amp;#x200B;

Which brings me to the next topic, and is actually the reason why I made this thread.

&amp;#x200B;

Now, I work together with my boss – face to face – (it's retail, but we're focusing on the online at the moment). The others are all doing the retail jobs: sales, administration, etc, typical retail job. I don't come into contact with the others a lot. I do get along with most of them, but to be fair: I'm the youngest of them all, and they really don't have anything interesting to say. That might sound arrogant, but seriously: you won't have any intelligent conversations with them (except with my boss). They've all been in retail for years and they sound miserable – plus they only complain and complain. I'm just there to work and build my career with the online stuff, I don't give a rats ass about making friends with them.

Anyway,  there's this one guy (he's around 50 years old, I'm 27ish) that keeps making jokes. Teasingly. Like, at my previous job there was also this one guy. Making jokes about you, trying to get under your skin. I know he's joking, and I know that the right thing is to ""joke back"", but it's SUPER exhausting for me. Like, I'm busy with other stuff, I don't have time to make jokes or to think of a great comeback. And because I'm more of an introverted, serious guy, he probably feeds on it. He probably thinks my hesitance or lack of ""making a joke"" is some sign of weakness or something? It's just exhausting and I don't know what to do. There are a million things I'd like to say, but frankly, I don't think it's worth it? I just don't want to be offensive.

There's also this new woman (40-ish) that joined, and she's also seeing my friendliness and kindness as a weakness, and I don't know what to do to make this obvious. I've tried ignoring her requests but it doesn't really help? I'm starting to think she's just too dumb to understand it.

&amp;#x200B;

The thing is, I don't know if I'm overreacting or if I would be in the right to just tell her to fuck off and stop talking to me like I'm a kid or her employee or something. I really want to tell that guy to just stop joking because he's not funny and to me, he seems like a miserable piece of shit trying to sound superior.

But again, I'm not sure if I would be overreacting.

&amp;#x200B;

This post is all over the place, typed on mobile, but I hope you can kind of grasp what I'm trying to say. Not sure if this fits in anxiety either. I do have other questions concerning anxiety, but this thread would get too big.

&amp;#x200B;

I do not know how or where to start on the issue I'm facing. Some background info on my mental health background. My father was diagnosed with Bipolar I in his early 20s and my mother has a history of abusive relationships before my father. So I realized very early that I was very susceptible to emotional instability.   

&amp;#x200B;

1. Background of emotional instability 
2. I have low self esteem and am currently working on improving it 
3. I do put my partner on a pedestal and he is teaching me why that is unhealthy 
4. I had a previous unhealthy relationship where we shared everything. Our room in a crowded apartment, our food, car, etc   

&amp;#x200B;

My problem: I'm in a relationship with a healthy, strong, supportive individual, but I cannot not seem to function normally when he is home. When he is home I become consumed with the fact that he is home. I continuously find things to go talk to him in his office about whether it has significance or not, I just want to be around him for the rest of the day without thinking about anything else and would not care if everything else went to shit.     


While going to make conversation with your loved one isn't abnormal, it is when it becomes the only thing you do and realize you CAN'T do anything else when he's home.  When he is not home, I do chores, take care of the puppy, read, listen to music, dance like no one is watching because no one is, etc. I stay busy in myself and if I happen to think of something that relates to him, I properly text him and don't expect a whole day and a half of conversation from it. While a lot of this is sounding very healthy, my attachment is unhealthy when he is home. I also have this weird thing where I can't seem to make or keep eye contact with him for very long when I get this way.     


I'm very tuned in to what my depression and manic symptoms look like in order to stay away from those triggers and behaviors. I'm not diagnosed with BPD, but I understand that I have to be careful. I have never come across this issue in any relationship I've ever had in any context that I'm aware of.   

&amp;#x200B;

I'm trying to find a way to deal with this anxiety I feel when my partner is home. I want to be able to function normally. My partner suggests that I try to think about the things I do when he's not home and motivate myself to focus on that. I am task oriented, so this seems like a good idea on the surface, but my mind always drifts back to feeling anxious that he's home.

&amp;#x200B;

For some context, the relationship is definitely not abusive towards either of us, and he is trying his best to help me through this. 

&amp;#x200B;

What can I do to alleviate this feeling?",1
145,"Last month my 10 year old was diagnosed with significant, but classic GAD. The severity of his anxiety is also spilling over and causing depression, so he's dealing with a lot being so young (and without trauma being a trigger). Having anxiety and depression myself for my whole life and our family being very aware of mental health, we were able to catch this pretty quickly and get him the treatment he needs. He's currently seeing a counselor every week for CBT/coping cat and a psychiatrist has prescribed a couple of different meds until he gets farther along in CBT and has the coping skills he needs to overcome this. 

He's a month into his diagnosis and only a few weeks into his treatment. We're noticing school is pretty difficult for him. We are VERY fortunate that his teacher and school counselor are incredibly helpful, communicative, and supportive of him during this. When he has the first signs of an anxiety attack, his teacher has him go to the school counselor's office or the school psychiatrist's office for a break and to work on calming techniques. Some of these techniques are playing games while talking about how he's feeling or taking a walk and talking things out. We're now frequently getting calls at the end of the school day to let us know what happened during his bad days and make sure we're all on the same page and have actions in place to move forward. His school counselor is pretty awesome and we're very thankful for that! 

We're at the point where he needs to have an informal plan in place with a list of different coping mechanisms for him. He can't get on a 504 plan just yet because he's not at the therapeutic dose on his meds. He's still working up carefully.  But, because he's so new in this, I have no idea how to help him at school yet. He's so new to CBT, he doesn't have any of those tools yet either, like working on thought-stopping techniques. I feel like we're in limbo where he's really struggling while all of this is getting started and it's a slow process to getting back on track to stable mental health.

I know we'll send him with some clay because he uses that for his anxiety tension in therapy sessions. I've just downloaded the What's Up app on his iPad and will have that for him to use when he goes to the counselors office (unfortunately, his iPad is kind of old and other mental health apps aren't downloadable). And the walking will continue. Beyond that, I'm lost as to how to help him. I know I'm scrambling for anything because I know how utterly terrible it feels to deal with anxiety and depression. I just want him to feel better and it's hard that it's a slow process. 

Even though everyone has different coping techniques, I would love to hear what you have in place for your kids dealing with anxiety in school. Thank you for the help!! ",1

I’m scared to go to sleep tonight. I’m fighting it by I’m so tired. I know I’m just going to wake up shaking and panicking. I know that nightmares are a side effect of anxiety but I’ve never dealt with that until now. I hate this. I feel so alone and unsafe. ",1

What I hate is dealing with it in public. In my case, at school. I can’t blow my nose. I attract too much attention to myself by walking up to get a tissue and then sounding like an elephant. I can’t go do it at the bathroom, either, because that requires a pass. I’ve only written two in all of my years of school, and I think I got them
both wrong. Not to mention how much courage it takes to go up and ask the teacher. Only for them to say no most of the time. Instead, I sniff whenever possible for seven hours and wipe a whole lot of stuff on my sleeve. Yes, it’s disgusting. 

Also, coughing. I don’t like doing it and drawing attention to myself in silence, or when someone is talking in fear of being disrespectful. I end up then choking trying to hold it back as my eyes water. It’s terrible and I probably catch people’s eyes more this way than if I could just cough it out like a normal person would.

150,"Hi everyone. 
So, I had an issue on Friday evening. I had what my husband thought was a seizure but the emergency room physician said was a dystonic reaction likely to my medication (seroquel 100mg) which I’ve been on for about two years at varying doses. 
Aside from that I’ve been having odd neurological symptoms for about the same amount of time that I’m having investigated by a neurologist currently. 
So, I’m seeing a new psychiatrist and at the request of the treating doctor Friday they have come to the decision to taper me off of seroquel, and add a mood stabilizer. I’ve never tried a mood stabilizer. This is the plan so far. She also affirmed my bipolar diagnosis made by the last psychiatrist I saw and also suspects I suffer from PMDD. But, that’s another story. 

Week 1
50mg of seroquel nightly 
450mg of depakote 

Week 2
25mg of seroquel nightly 
900mg of depakote 

Week 3
Stop seroquel 
(Start 1/2 tablet of trazodone for sleep as needed)

Just wanted to hear positive experiences with depakote. I’m trying to go into this win a positive attitude instead of being fearful.  ",1

I've never considered myself someone who is suicidal. Or depression for that matter, but I think my psychologist thinks that's debatable. So what I'm about to talk about won't pertain to that or lead onto it. 

I've been scratching my right arm for the past week. No reason to at first. No itch. Nothing there that says I should scratch but I did, for hours. I picked at the wounds until they bled. 

I realised I liked seeing it. Feeling the pain. I know it'll get infected if I don't stop. 

But it's made me think as to why I've been doing and thinking this way. 

I think I'm afraid to lose my anxiety. What would happen to myself if I keep getting the help I'm currently going through. I know I'm doing the best thing possible for me, and all the same I want things to change and not at the same time. I feel like a tilted painting: in the end, I'm still a painting. I'm just off center.

153,"Hey everyone. A background is I’ve been experiencing extreme anxiety and symptoms of OCD for almost a year now. 

I am on a new lexapro prescription and have been for only 7 days now. In the last few days I’ve been having some pretty bad anxiety and paranoia. 

It’s going to sound a little crazy but here’s what I’m obsessing over right now. My boyfriend found a painting on the side of the road with a beautiful frame. He picked it up and put it in the car, it was in good condition and we thought we could salvage the frame. But ME, of course, decided it must have bed bugs and that’s why it was dumped. I made him throw it away but now I’m obsessed with the idea that we have bed bugs. I’m afraid his car has them and they were brought inside on our clothes. I feel itchy now but have no bites and he has no itchiness or anything most likely because we probably do not have bed bugs. I am able to think rationally but I also can not kick this idea. I checked the mattress 3 times today and my body feels pretty itchy and it’s really stressing me out. 

I have had this happen to me before, at the start of my anxiety and obsession over things I was convinced I had an STD despite negative tests and would check myself in the bathroom every 10-30 minutes at work or home. I was able to kick this after a few months but now this new problem has manifested and I don’t see my psychiatrist until April 30th. 

What can I do? Anyone have any rational words or ideas for me?",1

158,"So I’ve basically had 2 weeks off work as I’ve been moving house (from my own apartment where I lived with my parter to my partner’s parents). I’m back in tomorrow and Friday for my weekly 2 days. I have been reluctant to speak out about this as I’m only working 2x a week but it’s really affecting me. I basically work in an office based civil service enquiry centre. Whilst it might seem like an easy job (I can’t really go into details), but the decisions I have to make for the callers can genuinely change their lives and mistakes aren’t acceptable. It’s a high pressured environment as it is, but working there with chronic anxiety is like hell. I’ve started getting chest pains from worrying so much about it and recently had a break down and ended up on a lot of medication. Also, my family and my partner’s family alongside many of my colleagues constantly harass me about not working there full time. The reason for this is that I used to go to uni Mon-Wed until I recently dropped out due to my mental ill health. I have thought about going full time but I can’t handle leaving the house and being around the general public for more than an hour or two so talking to people for 40hrs a week coupled with the stressful decision making, the likelihood of being abused on the phone due to the line of work and the pressure to interact with and banter with colleagues is too much for me. I’m actually getting weak knees just thinking about it. I feel so weak and other people are not supportive and tell me I’m just lazy and work shy. This makes me feel guilty so I feel like I can’t win. I feel like I don’t contribute to society and have been having suicidal thoughts at the thought of my family and others thinking badly of me. I can’t believe my life has turned out this way sometimes..
Anyway, I guess I just need to reassurance. I’m starting a new course for film and media in August which is more in line with what I want to do, so I know I’m taking steps to better myself and try to achieve my goals; however work and the pressure from everyone is cropping at the moment. I have tried to look for new jobs but everything in my area that’s part time is either cleaning jobs which would be fine but always state I need experience for, or more customer facing jobs which I don’t feel comfortable with. 

Am I being stupid not working full time? Any advice re literally everyone bar a couple telling me I’m lazy etc? 

TL;DR - I dropped out of uni, can’t work full time due to chronic anxiety, family and friends etc not supportive/understanding. Advice needed",1

At my high school we have 3 lunches, I go to 2nd lunch normally and I have friends in that lunch, but when I have a test in my 4th hour I go to 3rd lunch.

160,"For the past year or so, I have been working from home in an industry that isn't ultimately what I want to be in. However, it is really convenient because I get to spend a lot of time with my dog and have a lot of flexibility with my schedule. The downside is that I don't get a lot of socialization with other people throughout the day and I am not making any progress towards what I was hoping to do with my life. 

Background: I graduated college in August of 2017 and was hoping to gain some patient experience to pursue Physician Assistant school. Ultimately, I ended up taking a different job so that I could save some money and pay off my student loans. Now, I am about a year and a half out from graduation and am looking to transition into the healthcare industry. 

Here is where I am freaking out/can't process what I want/need: I have been away from the healthcare industry/school for a while and am not sure that this is what I want to do anymore however, I have no other passion in life at the moment. I figure that I give a new job a try and see if I still want to pursue it. The big thing that really stresses me out about this is the money. Healthcare support jobs pay so little and I can't live off of that wage for too long (more than 2 years with my savings) in the area that I live in. If I do like it, I have to take two more classes to fulfill prerequisites (Expensive and time consuming if I end up not going down this path). My fear is that I will not get into any schools the first time that I apply. I can't stop reading those stupid forums on GPA requirements and it is stressing me out. I feel so stuck. 

This might sound kind of stupid but, I am used to being around my dog 24/7 and she has become my best friend. I am scared of being away from her for 8+ hours a day. I know that's really stupid and that most of society leaves their dogs at home during the work day with no problem. I have just been in this comfort zone for a while and can't imagine my life any differently at the moment. 

I am in the midst of finding a therapist but wanted to see if there is anyone out there that has gone through something similar to what I am going through and/or that might be able to offer a little advice/support. I am just so stressed out every night thinking about the future and find myself making excuses for myself to not make progress in moving forward. TIA",1

162,"Alright so here's my situation: I'm currently a 23 year old university student. I'm currently a senior and only need roughly 9 more classes to graduate. My plan is to graduate next year, during the spring. I originally attended community college for 2 years and transferred to my local university where I've been currently enrolled for 4 years. This next year will be my 5th year. So in total, I've been enrolled at school for about 7 years trying to getting my bachelors degree.

The problem: I have really bad social anxiety. Ever since I was a kid, I've struggled with it. As a result, I don't have much friends, I find it hard to socialize with people, and I'm pretty awkward. Because of this, I've been putting off/failed/dropped most classes that involve doing presentations or any 'social' related assignments/projects. As a result, I have about a total of 7 F's in my transcript and will probably get another 3 more after this semester is over. Although I calculated that I might still avoid being on academic suspension if I get at least an A and C or B and B for the 2 remaining classes I'm enrolled this semester. Overall I'm just tired of this shit I've put myself into.

7 classes that I need are group/presentation based. I'm taking 2 presentation/group biased classes this summer. One of them is a speech class which obviously requires me to talk in front of others in order to pass. The other is a group/presentation based class. I've took this speech class twice, dropped it the first time and failed the second time, and the other class once (failed it). At this point, if I can't pass these 2 classes during the summer, I'd rather just dropout out completely since I'll end up in academic suspension.

So yeah, overall I need some sort of advice/help. I'm planning to drink a bit of alcohol to ease my nerves for the presentation. I'm not sure if that's a good idea since I've never tried it. Illegal drugs isn't an option since I don't want to get caught and go to jail or end up expelled.

Going to a therapist or something like that isn't an option since I can't afford it at this moment and I'm not sure what my parents will think about this. They don't 'approve' mental health.

Any advice/tips will be appreciated. I'm also willing to provide more info about myself/situation since I'm not sure what else to add.

Thanks.",1
163,"I am so happy I've been taking steps to getting a new (and better job). The thing I hate the MOST is talking on the phone with potential employers. I just get so nervous and feel like I'm never good enough. I usually stop myself from talking to them and don't call them, but this time I didn't. I had a phone interview and at first, I was really bombing it. Or at least, it felt like I was. 

But the interviewer actually wants me to come in for a second interview and it made me feel so relieved. It made me feel like I at least did something right.

167,"Hi guys.
Am in the second year off my degree.
Today had a small presentation like 3 minutes and while waiting for my turn I was having a panic attack. 

By the time I spoke my voice and face was shaking. I'm mortified and so embarrassed and had to try not to cry after. I'm training in a social field so feel like if I can't even speak in front of my class should I quit now before I get even more invested. 

Today was the first time my illness impacted my studies in front of others . Usually I come across a bit nervous but not as bad as today.
. 
I'm definitely in a depression at moment. Feeling stuck. Scared tutors gonna pull me up aswell after that moment

Thanks in advance and for listening

168,"I’m currently 24F in the US and have been (very) single for the past 3 years. I tend to be a little bit of a perfectionist and I’m very hard on myself when things don’t go right, whether or not it’s my fault. I’m also a very extroverted person (personality type: ENFJ), I don’t know if that’s relevant at all to this situation but I’ll throw it out there anyways. 

Long story short, I had a boyfriend from ages 19-21. We were friends, I didn’t really like him ~like that~ but he asked me out and I said yes because he seemed like a nice guy. Very soon after that he became an extremely aggressive and abusive drunk, and for some reason I still stayed with him. He had sex with me against my will, he used to hit me, and accused me of cheating all the time. He also used to grope and flirt with other girls at parties when drunk. 
I haven’t had sex, kissed, or even dated anyone since 2016. 

So ok whatever, it did take a toll on me but I feel fine and I’m over it, I’ve moved on. However, I can’t get myself to go on a date. Every single time I plan on going on a date I end up freaking out and bailing last minute. The most recent time I even changed and put on makeup before bailing. 

I think I’m just scared that I’ll end up dating someone like my ex again. I even have recurring dreams of being trapped with a guy who is an abusive drunk. How can I just get over this fear and move on?",1

I feel so stupid for failing at being normal. I’ll disappoint so many people if I don’t graduate but I hate college so much, it makes me miserable.

171,"Hey all, I am posting this now because of how desperate I was to find an account of someone taking buspirone who is -super sensitive- to meds. I've tried a few different meds over the years when I get to the point where I can't handle the anxiety anymore, but nothingggg has worked, and Wellbutrin landed me in the ER. Needless to say, I have been terrified to try anything else. 

I am exactly one week in on buspirone -- the first three days, I took 3.75 mg at night and then moved to 3.75 every 12 hours. Not going to lie, I have felt really out of it. I work in education and it's been extremely hard to focus on reading papers and helping students. My brain can now only focus on one thing at a time, which is very different from my standard operating procedure. That said, I don't really feel anxious, so there's that. Day 3 made me feel VERY panicky, but the feeling soon passed.

I've read a lot that 2 weeks is the magic number for buspirone to take good effect with fewer side effects. Hoping the fogginess dissipates and the lack of anxiety sticks! ",1

179,"I’ve been dealing with anxiety for a long time, alongside depression and autism spectrum disorder. Today, I was getting bullied pretty badly, and my stomach hurt. I went to the nurse office, and texted my tiger mom, who strictly refused to pick me up unless I went to the doctor. So I decided to rough it out, but suddenly my body started jittering, I felt like my legs were jelly, and I was sweating, breathing a lot. My heart was pumping, I felt a slight wave of fear.
Is this a panic attack?",1
180,"Hey everyone,

I could really use your collective wisdom and experience on something I've had difficulty in finding any information on.

In short, I get rolling anxiety attacks. Instead of 10-15 minutes of intense panic, my anxiety attacks last an hour minimum. However, more frequently than not they become somewhat permanent, lasting up to a month. And when I say they last, I mean my SUDS never dips below a 90, and I have constant racing thoughts, with pacing, lack of appetite, trouble sleeping, shaking and chest pain that starts as soon I wake up until I get exhausted enough where I can sleep again. I can't work because of it and my OCD.

I say rolling anxiety attacks, but it actually feels like one long anxiety attack. I'm just trying to better articulate what happens since even my OCD specialist doesnt believe I experience them as I do because he says its physically impossible. But its like, I know what an anxiety attack feels like, but for me they just keep going. I know something is misfiring in my brain.

This leads me to my question: is there another person alive out there who has some experience with this? It's been really difficult to find any information online whatsoever and I'd like even a nudge in the right direction.",1
181,"I am on a diet (keto). It is not a particularly hard diet to keep to, but a lot of fast food is kind of a big no no. Anyway, one of the things I've found that I can eat and don't mind is steak burrito bowls from Chipotle. I only allow myself out to eat food twice a week anyway, but yeah.

So I tell my friend that I was gonna get one, and she suggests I try Qdoba. I figure, what the hell, can't be much different, and maybe I'll like it more? They basically sell the same shit. Even though I've had a pretty awful time trying to order from places like these because of the nature of them.

**Big fucking mistake.**

That was over an hour ago at this point, and I have no food. She was going to try and send me a gift of an entree to, which was a really sweet gesture. Well, the whole process broke the moment I signed up.

After I sign up I find out there's a refer a friend program. Only **you cannot use this whatsoever on an account that already exists.** So, I failed the process, on the first step. And now there's no way back.

You can't delete your account, so this is now permanent. There's no tech support.

and even after all that, she can't even send me the goddamned gift because I'd have to go order in store and pay for it there. And fuck that, I'm not dealing with that anxiety ridden experience again. (Anybody else hate those ""construct your own meal"" places? It's like: Here, get in a line, and make 40 choices in 10 seconds, or else everybody gets super fucking mad at you and yells at you to just ""order what you want"", which isn't helpful because you have no idea what you want, if you knew how to make burritos that tasted like professionally made burritos, you wouldn't be going to a restaurant and paying someone else to do so).

184,"This just might become a rant and I don’t even know where to start so it also might be a jumbled mess. I have so much anxiety and fear over my future. I remember I used to LOVE school and it was my whole life and I excelled and it was something I was good at, I am a first gen student and my family really drilled it in me that an education is of the upmost importance in life. My whole family is rooting for me and I feel like if I don’t succeed and graduate, not just graduate but graduate at the top of my class with honors and be the best of the best, all their struggle and sacrifice will have been in vain and I will have failed them and myself. When I graduated high school I took a semester off because I was burnt out but taking a year off in my mind would have delayed me and been catastrophic. I feel like that was a mistake I should’ve just started on time and I wouldn’t be behind, I feel so behind. I am getting my BS in biochemistry to go to PA school in the future, my coursework is rigorous and I’m SO tired I feel like I’m running on fumes and I don’t graduate until fall of 2020 the thought of making it that far seems impossible. 
I would graduate PA school at 26, i know it sounds so stupid but I feel like I’m so behind and I’m wasting all of my 20s. 

I can’t work during school I’ve tried but it just leaves me crippled with anxiety and panic attacks and meltdowns because my coursework is so hard and I need to keep my grades up for PA school and employers are so not accommodating, so I have no money, I won’t have any money until I’m 26 it scares the hell out of me like what am I even doing? I have $400 to my name I live with my mom, I’m going to live with my mom until I’m what 28? Oh my god I will be almost 30 living with my mom, she’s a wonderful woman and my best friend and loves me unconditionally and would give me the world but I don’t want to live with her until I’m almost 30 years old. I want to live with my boyfriend of 3.5 years 

I graduate then he graduates then I get into PA school and 2 years later I graduate and then I have to work and save money and then we’re 28 and we’re still dating but living with our parents. How miserable. Moving out isn’t feasible the city I’m in is $1200 without utilities for an “efficiency” aka a room in somebody’s house, it’s insanity but I can’t work so I have no money so I can’t move to another city 
I could just not go to PA school but then what? What can I even do with a biochemistry degree I have absolutely no idea I only chose it because I wanted to get into healthcare and it fulfilled pre requisites while still being cool and fun but what do I do with that

If someone can offer some solace or advice or stories like mine that end well, please let me know I’m feeling at a loss here. I’ve suffered with anxiety for most of my life but it has really flared up as of recently and it’s become a lot to handle thanks for reading if you did ",1

191,"Hey guys, I've been a lurker on this sub for a while now, but because of what happened today I've decided to post this just to vent because it didn't go the way I hoped it would. Sorry about this long wall of text!

Just to preface this i'm 17 and have had social anxiety and general anxiety for years at this point and have wanted to get help for it, but... well, I've been too anxious to :P. I always just said i'd sort it out later and just tried to avoid or deal with the anxiety. This sub has been pretty helpful, especially seeing people who go through the same things that I do but recently its been getting pretty bad. About 3 days ago I started developing a ""tic"" which involves my head jerking back or to the side every couple of minutes/seconds depending on how anxious I am. I think this happened because I've realised how close exams are and how unprepared/unrevised I am for them and other anxiety causing things (like other people existing xD).  

Anyways, my parents decided I needed to get this sorted out if its getting too bad, so they decided to make an appointment. I was already anxious because I only had one days warning which made me double anxious. Anyways, onward to my appointment, I was already anxious because I was in public and looked crazy because of my tic and also  I was at my normal doctor but I wasn't seeing my regular GP, instead I was seeing another doctor that I didn't know.

I waited in the waiting room for a while and then got called into the room (I was there with my dad so he came as well). When I went in there was a man in what I would say was his mid 50's, with a blank expression and judging eyes (lol). He was the most monotone and slow (as in the way he acted and moved) person I have ever met. Imagine the sloth from Zootopia mixed with a ""SHHHHH"" librarian and a sprinkle of judgement and dissmisiveness. I honestly think he may have been on some sedative/drug by the way he acted TBH.  I thought this appointment would be the ""Hi, what are your symptoms, does this happen ? oh you probably have this, do this and this to make it easier/ to help"" type , I guess not. 

When I went in and sat down he just glared at me for a solid 5 seconds (why tho ?). For the next part ill be paraphrasing because I don't remember the exact things he said but ill try my best. The first thing he said to me was ""why are you here then"" in a bored voice, me being the anxious person I am just said ""well, i'm anxious, I think i have social anxiety and general anxiety"", he then said ""OK"" in the slowest and most untrusting tone I've heard for a while. He asked me a couple of questions like ""what is your default state of mind"", again being anxious I said ""anxious most of the time"", ""What is your social life, do you have any friends?"", ""Non existent and pretty much no because I'm too anxious to talk to people"". He asked about school and I said I'm doing OK, but that it's hard because I cant ask the teacher questions in class etc because I'm too anxious and don't want to be looked at or else my face goes red and my eyes start to water and also all the other things that come with general and social anxiety. At this point my face started to go red and I just blinked a lot so I was obviously visibly anxious (as well as the tics lol).   He then preceded to tell me that he ""cant do anything"" and that I should talk to a school councillor (my school doesn't have one) and maybe I should come back when I'm 18 because I could then get adult counselling and also he wouldn't want to treat it medically. Probably the funniest part was when he said that I should ""look online"" to get some help. Wow thank you! I had never thought of that!!! \\s

 The whole time I explained he had the blankest look I've ever seen on a human face. The only thing he did was print of a sheet with some websites on like the Samaritans and 2 other websites and said I should have a look. The way he went to print off that sheet literally looked like he was doing it in slow motion though with how slow/tranquillised he was. He did talk about a place in my city where I could go to look for help which is in the town centre. I'm pretty sure he didn't understand I would be too anxious to go there (my dad says hes gonna make me go there anyways :P). My dad asked about the tics and he said ""Its a physical manifestation of the anxiety"" which was probably the longest sentence he managed to say about my anxiety during this whole thing. I'm sure I didn't do this conversation justice but just imagine the most ""whatever"" doctor and then imagine them being sedated with horse tranquilliser.

That appointment was full of loooong pauses which made it even worse. Anyways, in the aftermath I'm pretty sure I don't want to go to the doctors again. My dad said hes going to get me an appointment with his doctor who's much nicer once I'm 18 (in 1-2 months) but I'm not sure if I want to. My dad agrees he was terrible so at least It wasn't just me. The only upside to this is that my mum contacted my school to tell them why I was off and apparently I might be able to get concessions (I think that's what it's called) where exams are marked more leniently. Although my head of year is going to tell all of my  teachers whats wrong with me (I think they just assumed i was awkward) because I never told them but I haven't in the first place because I never got a diagnosis ( technically still don't but I am not going to try to go back and go through that again, but he did say it was anxiety at one point sooo) and also I'm too anxious to.

&amp;#x200B;

Because of this, it has really put me off trying to get help if it will just make it worse than I started. I wish I was just a normal, non anxious human :P

&amp;#x200B;

Sorry if I over exaggerated at all, this  just happened to me so it's probably gonna be on my mind for a while ;P. ATM i just feel defeated and sad. I really hope this doesn't come off as a pity post because I just wanted to vent. Anybody else gone though the same ? ",1
192,"i am 25 years old. i dropped out of high school my senior year due to the crippling anxiety and depression and have done nothing but exist since. i've slowly gotten a little better over time, i can leave the house now but i still don't drive and the thought of public transportation gives me a panic attack. i've been living off a small inheritance sum the past 8 years but now that's out so i have to get some form of income or i die now.

but i have no skills, no work experience, no high school diploma, no form of transportation besides my feet, and i can't find a job online that i would be able to do (besides filling out surveys for maybe 3 bucks a day)

and the worst part was, i deluded myself for 8 years thinking i was fine and i could function at any time, that i just ""wasn't quite ready"" yet, and i would be good to go when my money eventually ran out. been on meds for most of the past 8 years and saw a psychologist once who couldn't help me but beyond that i never sought out any help, because in that little sheltered life i never was forced to confront that i needed it. now reality has hit and i am so, so scared. i don't want to die

195,"As the title says, I don't understand why I am so concerned with my appearance yet I do nothing to fix it. I cannot wear makeup anymore because I break out badly, plus I just suck at it so I end up looking heaps older. Clothes don't flatter my figure. I dunno how to do my hair or anything so I always just look plain or old and haggard. 

I have constant anxiety over my appearance. I use filters whenever I take photos for my friends on Snapchat. I got rid of FB and IG a year or so ago because I couldn't deal with all the drama and the insecurity seeing everyone made me. 

I hate it. I hate not looking how everyone else does. I am so jealous of the girls who are so effortlessly gorgeous and who can wear nice makeup and look good in clothes. I get so close to my face in the mirror and can't even count on both hands all of the flaws I can see. I don't know how to fix it. I've spent way too much money on face stuff and I'm still a greasy walking blackhead.

I'm not at all looking for validation but it's something that genuinely makes me upset every single day and it is impacting me very negatively. I get told that I am ""naturally pretty"" but that's from my friends and like, every single friend I've ever known gets told the same thing so that ""compliment"" does not hold much weight. 

How can I start overcoming this self hatred of my appearance? How can I stop feeling so much anxiety because of this when it's literally just what I look like and I can't change anything short of surgery and I am way too broke for that noise.

I get a lot of overthinking and intrusive thoughts when I'm in an over anxious phase. It's very very hard to shut my brain down and it can get extremely tiring. If I have a fight with my boyfriend or something it's pretty much bye bye sleep for that night. 

Before you suggest it, I can not handle melatonin, it gives me migraines and makes me feel horrible the day after. ",1
198,"First thing first - no idea what flair to use for this.


I recovered from anxiety a year ago exactly. I am living amazing life right now, insanely proud of it, workout regularly, got social life, I am more open, I don't worry so much, I can relax, responsibility is cool for me, colors are more colorful, sounds are clearer, food tastes better, I don't have urge to drink and so on.


But. I still feel weird about not being anxious and depressed. I know it might seem I am arrogant or humblebragging but is is a problem for me. I am so used to having problems and being overburdened after 21 years of severe anxiety that I feel weird about feeling good.  Like I have forgotten something I am supposed to feel shitty about. I am uncomfortable about being comfortable. 


It is like that old relationship, when you got abused and shat on for so long it makes you feel normal relationship is boring, you feel at home only when you are arguing and have angry makeup sex. You want a perfect girl who appreciates you, but you are so used to being in a bad relationship it is hard to move to something better. 

Like switching from your first , badly damaged and hard to drive car to perfectly comfortable and easy to drive brand new sport Mazda. 

Like switching from manual gearbox to automatic. Like you are supposed to do something with that leg but there is no additional pedal and you feel like you have forgotten something crucial yet you are perfectly fine and still going forward in an even more comfortable fashion.


What I mean is. It is still unnatural for me to feel so light hearted, laugh at everything attitude, it is weird to feel happy after such a long time. Like I am missing something because or lost something along the way. I had anxiety so long it was like half of me being who I am.  Like I am more shallow or something. I can't grasp it or understand it. Like I am somehow missing anxiety like a toxic relationship. And I feel bad for it. I know what hell it is to have anxiety yet I miss and dread that dark days at the same time.


Does anyone else feel this way?  I lurked here literally dreaming about getting rid of that awful anxiety yet I miss it. Any tips? It seems like a therapy material for sure. I am not used to feel good and it makes me confused sometimes, like I left something big behind, I feel too light sometimes.

other coping strategies dont work for me either, the only things that help are music, drawing (both i can rarely do) and hurting myself, not self harm, like digging my nails into my arm and scratching. all other strategies work for a few minutes but when i think about the thought that made me anxious in the first place, im 1000x more anxious about it.",1

So a few weeks ago I noticed what appeared to be a little bit of blood in my dogs stool so I took her to the vet because I was freaking out. They said she was fine but I still could not settle down. 

That was two weeks ago. Since then, only two times have a seen a little bit of red and it didn't appear to be much and even though they told me she is fine I am still losing my mind. I've had her since I was 6 and am now 20. 

This morning was one of the times her stool had a little bit of red on the outside but nothing ridiculous and she is still acting normal and eating and drinking normally. I feel like I overanalyze everything to find something wrong. I worry about a worste case scenario when there's a good chance nothing is wrong with her at all. 

It impact my daily life and my studies at college are suffering. I don't spend much time out because I feel like I need to be with her every second in case something is wrong although I have no confirmation that anything is.

Thank you so much if you took the time to read this. It was more to vent to people who understand how I feel. 

Love you all",1
202,"Hey,
a Friend of mine invited me to a party on Friday. 60 People will be there. Some of my year some of a year above and maybe 70% are unknown to me. I am very afraid of going there because of my social anxiety. I mean my social anxiety is very low but it is still there so what do you think I should do besides not going to the party which I will definitely not do?:)",1
203,"Background Info: I have been professionally diagnosed with GAD (Generalized Anxiety Disorder), APD (Avoidant Personality Disorder), Bipolar 2, and PTSD. I'm a 20yr who lives with his 21yr boyfriend, three states away from anyone else I know. I can barely leave my house, and only leave for doctor appointments.

I haven't worked in a year. After a full mental breakdown at a full time night job I had at a hospital, I quit. I couldn't stay in college, my grades were suffering too much, every new job I've tried I can't take more than a couple days. My last jib I quit on the third day, because my anxiety was so bad I was passing out, and I hadn't even started my shift yet!

I've been to doctors, I currently see a family doc, a therapist (twice a week), and a psychiatrist. I've been evaluated three times, and have been medicated since I was 18. My parents don't really believe in mental disorders such as bad anxiety, stress, and barely recognize my mood disorder. They were pretty abusive mentally and verbally, that was combined with neglectful tendencies.

I feel like I was set up to fail. I've tried holding down jobs, I try so hard, but I can barely make a phone call without out stuttering and then having a panic attack afterwards. I tried work rehab, but the case worker made fun of me in the appointment and forced me into a panic episode. She didn't even stop when I started hyperventilating/crying/shaking. I ended up reporting her and leaving with no help. 

My therapist agrees with me on applying for disability, but I have no idea where to start. I brought it up to my psychiatrist, but she never really addressed it. I was taught to never accept help from anyone, so being handed money to survive is kinda a hard thing to think about. But, my bf can't keep supporting the both of us. We are living paycheck to paycheck, and still barely surviving. I'm already on Medicaid to pay for my doc appointments. Honestly, it's killing me to let him provide everything for me.

I feel helpless, lost, and like a failure. My mother even told me straight to my face that my younger brother was better than me. That she was proud of him and disappointed that she couldn't say the same for me. Mind you, my younger brother is an alcoholic at 18, physically abusive, has done a hit and run, and respects no one. Talk about a loving family. I don't know what to do anymore. I was never really a suicidal person (too afraid to die), but I feel like this is why people kill themselves, this is the feeling they have. ",1
204,"Hey guys, the title sums up the gist of my problem. My anxiety gets me through thoughts of “looking *absurdly* silly” to “everybody’s looking” to “stop it you’re embarrassing yourself, they’re only smiling for pity.” 

Deep down I’m a very “gooey” emotional person who loves listening to the same few songs he has and dance to them on occasion. Well, really, by dance I mean sway like a fool but it’s basically anything that gets my body or hips moving. However, my anxiety REALLY hinders showing this side of myself to others (even to people closest to me) because I get waaaay too embarrassed and my thoughts attack me and I stop having fun with it. At the end, this forced me to be tagged “uptight” and “like a dad” - the last one makes me laugh but I’ve heard it way too many times that whenever I try to combat my anxiety and show my “fun” side I get “what are you doing?” looks from everybody.

In the end, if somebody has a really good book recommendation on “letting loose” and/or how to change the prefixed personality people perceive I have I’d be very grateful.

Thank you!",1
205,"I have been on this medication for 5 weeks now for anxiety and panic with slight depression. 

The first two weeks were 10mg. I felt better but still had panic attacks sometimes

The second two weeks were 20mg. The first of the 2 weeks I felt absolutely incredible, but in week 2 of 20mg all my anxiety and sadness came back. 

I spoke to my Dr. and upped my dose to 30 for a week to transition to the 40mg dose. My week on 30mg started decent but then i began to feel anxious and depressed again

TODAY is day 1 on 40mg and I feel pretty good. Overall my anxiety has subsided a lot but I’m scared it’s going to bottom out in a few days... will this ever level out? Can I look forward to some consistencies in the future?? Anyone who has experienced please help a brotha out",1
206,"I always thought that I was scared of being rejected. Applying for something and being seny away andhaving my application denied. Or asking someone out and being rejected.

But turns out, my true biggest fear is to be ""found out"", or not having the talent or desire to ""follow through"". The fear is that someone takes a shot on me and gives me an oppertunity and stick their neck out. I'm scared they'll do that, only to find out I'm nothing more than a fuck up and screw up and they realise how useless and stupid I am and that they could maybe give someone else the opperunity. Someone actually deserving of it. Not someone that would squander it",1
207,"Long story short, Ive been at my place of employment for over 10 years. I worked from the ground up. I started as a janitor, moved to customer service, and now work in IT. 

I never knew IT work could be so stressful. Project deadlines,  daily meetings, constant off the clock emails, and etc... One year into the job, I had my first panic attack. I could have sworn that i was having a heart attack. After a hospital stay, doc told me it was most likely stress related and prescribed me alprazolam. 

Fast forward two years... im still on the pills. Im so anxious when i get home from work, that its hard to relax. Im taking a xanax daily just to calm down. My weight is going up. I feel like crap all the time and I feel like im always waiting for another panic attack.

Im not sure what else to do. Anyone else in similar situations?",1
208,One thing I hate about my anxiety is that I’ll be completely fine for months or years then one thing will pop into my head and I become completely OBSESSED!

Can anybody please recommend something to help me relax and actually listen to myself when I say “you’re just creating issues and problems that don’t actually exist” ,1
209,"I have used Benadryl occasionally to help with sleeping. It did make me calm, however, it also made me hallucinate. Is there anything similar? Or maybe even herbs that I can try? I don’t want to see more doctors and I have PTSD from all hospitals, clinics... well DOCTORS. HELP.  ",1
210,"Its school work mostly. In class and on homework I can't get it dont because I cant focus. And then the work piles up. And that makes my anxiety worse. And when my anxiety gets bad, my focus issues get worse. Making it harder to work, my anxiety gets worse and so on and so forth.
Does anyone else have this issue? Because it is extremely hard for me to deal with.",1
211,"Hey
As the title says, I'm 19 years old and never kissed a girl. This is my biggest psychological problem, and it feels like I must puke every time someone speaks about this or asks who the last person i ""hooked up"" with.

So a little back story. Im playing football, talking to girls every day at school (I have no problem talking to girls), good looking ( get a lot of compliments about my smile, and I'm well trained (got abs etc.)). We started to party with alcohol when I was 15 and goes to a party at least once a week, but I haven't hooked up with a single girl in my entire life and this kills me. I am almost considering to go to a therapist.
All of my friends have done it, most of them have had sex as well. It feels like I'm the only person in the entire school that has not done it.

I can use hours to  get to sleep because I think of this, and it's becoming a serious problem for my mental health. I will really appreciate every advice!

(Sorry for any typos, English is my second language)",1
212,"I am having very mixed feelings right now. I'm relieved that I no longer have to worry about studying all the time but bummed that I stepped out when I started to feel more confident about my school performance. I'm going to start the school year over again in August, but it sucks knowing my classmates are going to move ahead without me. But I think partial hospitalization is the right thing for me since I've been dealing with anxiety my entire life and never truly addressed it before. Any advice and encouragement would be appreciated.",1
213,"I’m gonna start off by saying that I know group therapy helps some people and it does have a place. 

That said, my doc keeps trying to push me into an intensive outpatient program for my anxiety issues even though I keep telling him over and over that I’m not interested in the least. I’ve outlined and carefully explained my reasons as well as repeatedly explaining that I don’t have transportation to get to the center yet he keeps bringing it up. 

Yesterday things came to a head and he made me extremely uncomfortable. He stared going on about group therapy, (did I mention he runs the center he’s recommending), and said that when the meds and individual therapy, (I have a therapist), are proving ineffective the next steps are an intensive outpatient therapy program and that I “could just white knuckle my way through” and then hospitalization. WTF?!?! Hospitalization for social and generalized anxiety?!?! I haven’t had a panic attack since I can’t remember when and I’m not depressed so what the hell?!?! He really freaked me out saying that. Thinking maybe it’s time to start looking for a new doctor. Anyone have any thoughts on this or similar experiences?

214,"so hey. i guess were gonna talk about some anxiety boiz.

i basicly feel like no one likes me, every one hates me and doesnt have the hearth to tell me most of all I feel like I will end up alone.

im 14 and male. my gf recently broke up after just 5 days. and while this sound stupid, wich i know it is. This f-ing destroyed me.

i didnt even have any perticular feeling for her when she confessed. but the reality that someone liked me enough to ask me out was insanely comforting. 

having a gf makes all my insecureties and anxiety go away. but when that diseapered i wasnt even able to go to school for that day.

i always feel like im a pest. and i fear i will never be able to seek the comfort I was able to seak in my x, even though we didnt talk that much.

the only person in my life I feel i can kinda trust in my bud T-dog. but at times i feel like even he hates me (he told me when i comfronted him about it I was his best friend. and i can trust that)

just nothing makes sense. anf for those wanting to ssy im love sick,nope. I was able to dig through that mountsin in s chat with t-dog.

im just insanely insecure and have tons of anxiety. 

what do?",1
215,"Last week I was bent backwards by a huge amount of stress over deadlines and where I built up a good amount of sleep deprivation. I had a group project that was failing for which I stayed at school till 9:30pm because my friend and I were the only ones actually doing shit, which led to me not having enough time to finish my individual project due two days later, for which I stayed up till 4/5am twice and I still couldn't get it done in time so now it's not even gonna be looked at for at least until the resit... Then the weekend came and even though I have more deadlines this week (though much smaller ones) I decided to do absolutely nothing for school. Saturday was nice. I wanted to game a bit but ended up staying in bed till 2pm, then doing a deep clean of my entire room because it was a *mess*, then doing the cooking and after I cleaned the kitchen it was already time to go back to bed. It kind of left me with mixed feelings because I felt really good about finally having cleaned my room after postponing it for literally months but I didn't actually do the relaxing stuff I wanted to do... Sunday was a lot tougher because I had to work. I do tutoring and I planned two sessions of two hours right after each other because both students had their exams this week. It left me exhausted and I ended up not doing much after anymore. I just gamed a bit with a friend.

Then the week started and mayhem began. I have some thing we call seminars at my school where you  can (or have to) follow a two-week course organized by another study program within school, which allows you to expand your horizon a little bit. It's really nice and I'm doing something incredibly fun but it's super intensive. I need to wake up 6:50am each day for two weeks straight and then do a lot of physical work until 4/5pm. Add to that the sleep deprivation of last week, the two deadlines I still have to do for Friday, the usual stress of commuting 1:30 each way, and to top it off the anxiety from all the groups we need to make (each day a new one so far) and the social aspect of it in general and I basically can't function anymore. I can do anything on automatic pilot mode but anything that requires thinking is out the question. I tried solving some problems yesterday for a cool idea we had but I just... couldn't. My head is throbbing with pain from a cold and from a neck ache that's likely caused by all the stress. When I get home I can't even play games because I'm so tired, even though I get enough sleep right now. I can't believe this is normal...

Yesterday and today were just awful. Especially yesterday. I'm getting all the negative thoughts back which had left me for a good few months. It's mostly unconditional self-hatred and it's awful. I crucify myself for literally everything I do or don't do and I can't rationalize it. I hate on other people for things they did to me as if they were trying to hurt me, which they aren't. I (silently) judge everyone for doing things I don't like (mostly things about myself that I recognize in others). And to top it off I don't even know if that's what I'm doing because I know I'm in a bad place so I tend to think super negative about anything I do and blow things way out of proportions. Maybe I'm just making it all up.

Right now I feel like I'm such a creep to some of the girls at that course because... I just look at them when they talk? I just feel so uncomfortable with the thought of ""oh she's pretty"" because I feel like anything I do will immediately be interpreted as being too much. But I basically feel uncomfortable with any thought I have or any thing I do in any context and with anyone because I feel like I'm not being good enough to people around me or that I'm giving a super bad impression. And half of the people at this course are actually normal classmates of mine. I don't know them super well but at least it brings some familiarity to the room, so that makes it even worse that I'm so constantly worried about anything. I'm kind of scared to show too much association with them because it'll look like I'm excluding the others but I'm also trying to show that I like them (I don't really?) which will make me feel like I'm excluding the others. I can't focus on anything positive anymore and I hate it... Even the objectively good things that happened today feel like bad things right now... Even when, as I was going home, I felt pretty okay... And I don't have any proof that it was bad, it just automatically is bad because some other bad things also happened. Today I also had that feeling of my stomach sinking and a deep, strong heartbeat several times on a single day while it happened like maybe once a week during the last couple of *weeks*. 

I have many moments where I have a lot of doubt about whether I actually deserve therapy or even a diagnosis because so many people have so much worse problems than me (I know how cliché it is but it's just true). I have many moments I feel like I don't belong with the general group of 'people with anxiety' because I can still go grocery shopping, hang with friends and get stuff done and it's a feeling that never truly leaves me. I'm in a constant cycle of ""you can do anything you want! So just stop bothering your therapist with your petty crushes and intrusive thoughts"" to ""huh this is weird I'm feeling so good"" to a sudden ""well this is plenty proof I have anxiety"" to ""this can't anxiety but there's definitely something wrong with my mental health"" back to ""oh cool I was feeling worse but now it's getting better again"" but at all those stages I have things I avoid like the plague and things that would give me immediate anxiety if I dared thinking about them (such as imagining telling people (my therapist included) some things that (in my view) really make me look bad). Right now I'm kind of in a mix between ""I have anxiety"" and ""this is something else"" and it's not nice. I just want this gone...",1

217,"Long story short, I got on Zoloft last October a few months after I had my second child. I had never been on medication before but was experiencing some really intense anxiety and intrusive thoughts. The Zoloft at 25 mg worked great and I actually started feeling like myself again. That faded so I went up to 37.5 and was having a lot of success. That started to feed as well so I went up to 50 milligrams about a month ago. Intrusive thoughts are gone but I really don't feel like myself at all. I don't know if I'm not giving myself enough time at the right dose or of this medication just isn't for me! It's been about 6 months at this point but I've been all over as far as dosage goes. I therapists thinks I should try buspar. I'm not sure how I feel about that. What was your experience on Zoloft??

220,"My mom has been puking hard all afternoon. And I'm scared shitless that I will puke too, I have always had the fear of puking. I guess it has to do with childhood trauma (when I was little I thought I was going to suffocate when vomiting). I do everything to avoid getting sick: I don't eat out unless I know for sure that the food is safe to eat, I check dates, I won't eat anything that is not completely fresh, I wash my hands all the time and I especially avoid all contact with people who might be sick.
Now I'm panicking because I was around my mom most of the time, we ate the same food, drank the same stuff, I even ate some of her ice-cream (which I trusted, mom didn't ahow any signs of being sick at the time). So if she's infected, then I am too.

221,"I do things like clench my jaw, squeeze the muscles in my legs when I'm sitting, etc., but the worst is when I tense my foot (like I'm flexing it or just not moving it right) as I walk and *can't stop* doing it. Sometimes even when I'm sitting at my desk, I'll be swirling my foot around. It's always the righthand one. In either situation, by the end of the day my ankle is all swollen and painful. The shoes I wear don't make a difference. Has anyone else experienced this?? Psychologically my anxiety has improved significantly with a change of diet and lifestyle - but these tense habits persist even when I'm in a good mood! ",1
222,"Today is the second time I feel this way. I was selling an old iPad and had communication issues with the buyer. It’s resolved (with me lowering the price) but I am still sitting here and feeling weird. My chest feels like it’s constricting and taking in my throat, and my arms feel tingly. The more I think about it the more intense it feels.  Which is why I probably should try to distract myself, but this time the feeling is worse than the first time (when my bf and I were mad at each other a few weeks ago). As I read other posts on this page, I really don’t want to let this feeling get to the point where some people are at (I don’t mean to offend). Just trying to stomp out the fire before it spreads I guess.

A little backstory i moved from Asia to Europe for my college degree(comp.sci) , i have never really lived alone and I've always had people i know around me and never felt alone before, I don't really have anyone to talk to or get closure so i thought i might as well post here and get some advice and maybe how knows i might even feel a bit better

As i said i moved from Asia to Europe I've been here for nearly a year (still a first year) and my first semester was a decent semester i got good grades 8/10s in most of my classes except for calculus which i failed even though i tried my best (not really good at math) i guess that's when it happened i had my first real panic attack mind you i have failed in classes many times in high-school failing wasn't the issue facing my parents was, for nearly a week i didn't attend any calls from my mom or my dad or my sister, they were really upset obviously i lied to them and that i was on a trip with friends and i haven't used my phone because i was having ""fun"" with my friends and i dodged the question for a couple more days and eventually told them and clearly they were upset but was understanding they knew that was pretty bad in math they told me it was alright and told me to do better when i retake the class i felt a bit better i guess, but that was just the starting of the problems i started to have like a pit in my stomach even if i  just wanted to go outside to get food or do anything normal i felt like this for nearly a month but i still was stubborn about it and the second semester started, the nail in the coffin for my anxiety to just go out of control i was just about to go to enter my class when i heard the supposed people i called my friends were talking about me they were calling all kinds of bad things talking about how ugly i looked (i already had issues with how i looked because i was bullied about how i looked through out middle school right untill i finished highschool so that really hit me hard) and how they were trying to get rid of me but i was bit clingy, i just froze i didn't know what to do they hadn't seen me so i just turned back and just bolted home trying not to cry and just shut myself off from everything i couldn't even sleep without crying i couldn't even try to go to class just the thought of it makes me feel like i want to die

And that leaves me here right now i can't even talk to my parents or my sister and i'm really down right now and i don't really know what to do coupled with the fact that i have missed almost every test and assignment given untill now i'm most likely gonna get fucked by the end of the semester so yeah i just wanna get this off my chest so i can feel a bit better i guess

227,"Hello everyone,

So basically I suffer with pretty bad GAD and have some trust issues because in the end people seem to always end up blocking me. It happened quite a few years ago pretty badly to me as someone who I saw as a close friend blocked me because I kept messaging too much. Then last week it happened again to me but this time I didnt do anything wrong but still got blocked. All I am trying to do is make some friends but the fear of being rejected/blocked in the end is so strong.

Moving on I am now speaking to am American guy and we get on pretty well so far but am constantly worrying and thinking he will block me.  We got into a conversation about how his mates are into dugs and because I am against it I tried pointing out to him that drugs are bad and what made it even worse he says he occasionally also does it. We didnt have an argument or anything but because we had different point of views I was so worried he was gonna block me so I apologised so much when i didnt even do anything wrong tbh. This is not the first time either as I seem to apologise all the time and even he pointed out to me to stop saying sorry all the time. But I just feel if i dont keep saying sorry he will block me, even when i do nothing wrong.

I hope this post kinda makes sense and hopefully someone could give me some advice. Thank you for reading.

Today, I am feeling a hell of a lot better than I did  when I quit therapy and haven’t thought about nor attempted suicide since. 

I want to get back into therapy because I haven’t had a job in a while and need guidance getting back to working since I don’t have any current job references. 

Not only the “having no job” thing but I just want to better myself in general and I really enjoyed working with her when I would go see her every week.

I was very open and honest about everything whenever I would go and see her but this is the one thing I never told her about.

I called her today to see if I could make an appointment and still have yet to hear back.

My question is, if I tell her about this past attempt (which again was almost 2 years ago), can she have me hospitalized? Not sure if this is a stupid question. 

Again I want to reiterate that I haven’t attempted nor thought about suicide since two years ago. Honestly, I’m not even depressed nor do I have intense anxiety like I used to, I just want to get back into counseling while things are already going well for me mentally.

I think it’s better for myself to get into counseling now while things are going well rather than wait until I fall back into a depression.

Any answers would be appreciated, thanks in advance




TLDR: I attempted suicide two years ago but haven’t thought about suicide nor have I attempted it since. Can a therapist have me hospitalized even though this happened almost 2 years ago?",1
235,"Hi. 

So my situation is probably like that of many others. 

I am just now graduating from an expensive school (expensive for me with the 60% scholarship I am getting) and I have no job prospects because even though this school was expensive and put me and my parents in debt - it is still not that great of a school. 

I am super stressed about this situation that  I can't breathe, eat or sleep. I am completely broke, I can't find ANY job (i've worked in a minimum wage job, i am referring to something related to my major). 

2 months ago, I got a job offer for a place which is pretty far away from where I live, it was great pay BUT ...and get this... I COULD NOT AFFORD TO START WORKING since I can't afford to move there. 

Has anyone else felt stressed and anxious about money ALL the time? If so, what do you do about it? (please don't respond with get a job because OBV what I'm trying to do).

Thanks for reading my vent. ",1
236,"My anxiety has gotten worse over the last few years. It comes in waves and at different levels.

But in the last year I’ve had about 5 different jobs. Two of those being jobs I would love and would be excellent for me. Prior to starting and in the first week  I end up quitting I get so worked up, stressed, overwhelmed with failing and having to learn new information I end up quitting after 2-3 days. Lasted one day the last job, most recent job offer I got hired on the spot and accepted and didn’t even make it in to the first day. 

I get headaches, chest hurts, I get kind of depressed, sometimes angry, cry, and sometimes get super obsessive of what I’ll have to do. I’ll have stomach issues, and I don’t even feel like eating. All this doesn’t happen at once it just depends.

It’s put a lot of pressure on my husband financially. I’m going to try to get back into dog sitting. It’s not a fast paced environment and no people. I just really can’t handle jobs with lots of responsibility. I need a slow simple job, that pays decent, but I guess that’s one of the problems.

I’m not particularly worried since I think it’s just caused by me slowly taking less and less CBD, so my body is still learning to regulate itself without it. I can always start taking more again.

Minor vertigo

Eyes hurt when moved up and down

Random tingling in extremities

Chest pains

Burning sensations in head

Tension in neck

Coordination is sometimes off

IBS like stuff

Pupil size difference

Head rushes

Annual migraines (on the right side, hurts when i move my head, starts with me not seeing like a reg migraine but then i can see fine, and the pain starts, and its every year around spring or summer)

Mood swings

Little specks flash in my vision

Chest tightness

Maybe memory loss

Changes in personality (recently flirted with the idea of dying my hair when i have never had any interest in doing so, maybe even condemning it?) 

Shakiness in hands

Acid reflux
Feel like im drifting when im walking, or im gonna fall over.

Feels like im not speaking correctly or i have no idea what to say and stammer

Hypersensitive to noises. Sometimes i can hear my neighbor snoring through his walls but i cant hear what my mom said 8 feet in front of me


These all started after my great aunt died of a brain tumor, when we all thought she was healthy. She never had any symptoms until she was having stroke like symptoms when she closed her eyes. She died a few months later and my hypochondria started a few weeks later. 

.For about 2 years i was anxiety free, but a couple months ago my dog was diagnosed with a brain tumor and died in my arms on valentines day. Now my anxiety has been 100 times worse and for some reason me wanting a streak of dye in my hair makes me think i have a tumor ( personality changes being a major symptom). But i really dont know who i am. Ive invested so much time in my dog, friends, family and video games that now that im by myself i have no idea what to do. ",1
243,"I moved to the UK in 2017 from Singapore. I had a lot of friends there and was probably what you would consider one of the ""popular"" people in school - always going out, lots of friends, parties, smart (I know I might sound snobby and cocky but I had all that back then). Now that I live here, I don't have any of that. I barely go out, I can count the number of friends I have here on one hand, I have never been invited to a party here and my grades have dropped so bad that I had to drop a year (grade for Americans). I've visited Singapore twice in two years, and both times I blew over £600 (800 USD) in less than two weeks because I was out every night with my friends, getting fucked up, going for dinner, travelling etc. Now that I can't go back, I always see my friends doing those things without me every week. It frustrates me so much to see them be happy without me because I know I can't be with them. It's not just that they go out without me, it's also that they never make time to talk to me because they are so preoccupied. Weekends have been so lonely for me because there is nothing for me to look forward to, not even conversation. I don't value my friends here at all like I do with people back in Singapore. This girl told me a secret that she hooked up with a guy in school who had a girlfriend and when I asked her why she would tell me that, she replied with ,""because I really needed to tell someone and you don't have any friends so I'm not risking anything by letting you know"". This made me feel so shit because it was true. I'm just some stress ball for her.  I can't tell my friends in Singapore that, they haven't made time for me. I can't tell my mum, she lives in Japan ( nine hours ahead so time difference makes it difficult to talk) and I can't tell my dad. My dad is a weird guy, he is the reason we had to move to the UK against every hope that I had. My mum was in tears when she found out we had to move to London and so was I. I guess it isn't that bad for her, she lives in Tokyo with her family so she has friends and stuff to do. I just realised that I have less friends than my mum or my dad. Anyway, since moving here, my dad drinks everyday. One day, he started drinking at 8:30 am after having an argument over the phone with my mum because of his drinking habits. In an effort to secretly drink that day, he put his wine in his coffee mug. Shit place to hide such a smelly drink. The day before, he had come into my school drunk and picked me up in his car. The humiliation is unlike anything I have ever felt before. I had two choices: stay home the next day and hide from the embarrassment or go to school to avoid my dad. I chose the second option. He has embarrassed me on several occasions: turning up to my football match drunk and shouting from the sidelines, initiating a massive argument with me in front of my friends, driving me home drunk, calling me in the middle of class and getting angry when I don't answer, calling out my teacher in front of me and my friends, taking the piss out of the fact that my school recommended me to a therapist... the list goes on. He did all of this while drunk. Finally, karma got to him and he fell down from the top of the stairs, shattering his arm (the doctor said it looked like a crushed packet of crisps) and stopped breathing twice in 10 minutes. I thought this was an enlightening moment for him and he would finally recover. Nope. that was over a year ago. If I was at school that day, he wouldn't have gone to hospital. A part of me wish I went to school. A couple of months ago, my mum finally came to London but only for a short while. My parents got into a massive argument again but it was much worse this time. My dad started accusing my mum of slashing his leg with a knife (obvious bullshit because there is no scar) and then threatened us with suicide. Imagine your own dad saying that he was going to kill himself if we didn't side with him. My mum wants to seperate, I want them to divorce and I want to move out. But I can't do any of that for at least a year and a half. I'm lost. I don't know what to do. All this time, my friends are just going out, having fun and doing whatever they want. They are even going on holiday to Thailand all together, except for me because I'm still in school. I hate seeing them have fun now. Nobody has to reply, I just needed somewhere to vent. Trying to see if talking or writing down how I feel helps at all. I've tried councillors but they don't help at all. They just somehow managed to make the conversation about themselves and change the subject. I do MMA to try and relieve some stress but that only works if I do well. I've fallen out of love with football because its just so shit in England. I don't have any real friends to talk to here so I can't do that. I've tried to run for executive positions within the school but that didn't work. Oh well, what can you do, hey? All I know is, as soon as I'm done with school and university in England, I'm getting out of this shithole country and moving to Asia. West ain't best. Thanks for reading x",1
244,"I’ve seen so many specialists this month. I’m now transferred to Mayo and have out of state doctors (and one international) trying to help me.

All he said was,”Your labs get worse each week but we aren’t finding the source of whatever it is you are fighting.” 

I can’t talk to anyone about this. I don’t want to sound dramatic, even though I look like hell and you can visibly see I’m sick. I don’t even weigh over 100lbs anymore.

247,"I will try to keep this as short as possible! I know a lot of this will sound silly but please bear with me. I (23/F) have been a merchandiser for 5 years, the work is in retail stores and I do resets, stocking, building displays, etc. I don't work for the stores themselves -I am employed by an outside company that sends me in to do projects for different clients. Here's the catch: I have always worked with either my mom or my boyfriend, they were employed with the company at the same time so we just did all of the work together and split the pay, the supervisors didn't actually care because it wasn't really ""against policy"" since we were all employed with the company. So while working I always had a ""buddy"" with me. I liked this a lot when we first started because I have always been deathly afraid of being kidnapped or assaulted, etc. My boyfriend has a new job as of 6 months ago so I work with my mom right now, the company isn't doing so well and the hours are dwindling to the point we can't rely on it. I started looking for a new job about 6 weeks ago because I have felt like I want more independence and of course a reliable paycheck! I applied to a handful of positions, I wasn't going crazy because it was important to me to work somewhere I would feel safe and preferably work during daytime hours with other people around, other people are a security measure for me and make me feel safer. I somehow landed an interview for a ""universal sales associate"" at a reputable and HUGE credit union in my town. Keep in mind I have never had a ""real"" interview before, the jobs I have had didn't really require it- as long as I was willing and able they hired you, haha. I prepared diligently for the interview, had my boyfriend mock interview me, I researched the company thoroughly, wore very nice clothes, I was as ready as I could be. I went in for the interview scared as heck, feeling like they wouldn't see ""me"" but a walking cluster of fear and anxiety. It went pretty well I thought, but never having been interviewed before I didn't really know. I was contacted today with the offer letter/phone call. The pay is good, something I don't feel like I even deserve. The job sounds good albeit a bit confusing since this is a new position within the company. I want the job! BUT....on the phone the HR rep was talking about benefits/perks and I heard her say something about ""you are fully covered under our insurance for group travel for conferences, etc."" My stomach dropped when she said it, but I didn't interrupt or ask about it for fear of sounding like a weirdo. In the offer letter it also states this about the group travel thing, all the way at the bottom. Travel wasn't mentioned in the job listing or in the interview. Of course in my overactive mind I am thinking they are going to just throw me on a plane by myself across the country for some conference. I have never been on a plane, never traveled anywhere alone further than 40 minutes from my house and most of the time I shy away from going to stores alone because of the fear of human trafficking. SO.. am I blowing this out of proportion in my head? Is it common for banks/credit unions to send their employees all over the place all the time out of state? This is an entry level position to my knowledge, they know I have no banking experience of any kind. I want to ask the details of the travel but what if it makes me come off like a freak baby? I don't want my anxiety to ruin this opportunity for me, I have pushed myself so hard lately and I want to keep progressing. I just am not comfortable with going somewhere far all alone and possibly having a meltdown in an unknown area. This was way longer than I thought- I'm sorry!

248,"Sorry if this is the wrong subreddit for this.

All of my energy to get things done is gone. I once was an ""A"" student, and I failed my most recent math test. I've just been going through the hoops, not knowing what I want to do or what I enjoy. I'm not even sure if there *is* anything I enjoy. I don't feel like I'm good enough at anything to make a meaningful contribution either. With college quickly approaching, and no semblance of motivation or what I want to do, everything seems hopeless. Like I'll be stuck in a job I hate with a degree that I don't care about, and I won't be able to support myself, or anyone else, for that matter. I feel like I'm just going to amount to nothing because I'm lazy and a procrastinator, and no matter how hard I try, I can't find anything that I enjoy enough to stick with it. Anything the I might enjoy doing can't be made into a career, at least not a career that I'm likely to obtain. I've heard that not knowing what to do is normal at my age, that I have plenty of time left. But when college is this expensive, we don't have the money for me to get this wrong and figure out what I really want. I need to get it right in the first shot. And I think I'm too much of a procrastinator to do well in college anyway.

249,"Hey reddit,

&amp;#x200B;

I got my first ever job as a gardener and been at it for 3 days this week. Today we were cutting some bushes and I was asked to use a brushcutter. It's like a long chainsaw, but there's a round saw at the end of it and you have to use straps to wear it because it's heavy. You also need a protection headwear/mask for your eyes and ears, because it's really loud.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm a 19 year old girl and I've never used a brushcutter before. I'm not normally skittish, but the thought of having to wave that heavy thing around made me anxious and then it escalated into a panic attack. I could work with no issue around the trimmer, I even got it waved in front of my face couple times by my coworker who was inexperienced as well and I didn't bat an eye, but it was the thought of using it that got me. I spent the car trip back hyperventilating and secretly crying so my coworkers wouldn't notice. Later I told them that I was feeling sick and they said I shouldn't use the trimmer if I wasn't feeling well, so I didn't.

&amp;#x200B;

I like my job and I'm not overly girly for this profession, but somehow the brushcutter made me panic. I'm so ashamed to tell my coworkers that I'm afraid to use it, if my manager found out she'd probably have to reevaluate my capability for this work. I struggle with anxiety sometimes in certain situations but this panic attack was pretty bad. I dread going to work tomorrow, for we have more bushes to cut with the trimmer.",1

So... When I was a child (I  do not remember how old I was ) but i was entering 6 grade, a normal day, but something in a way that I do not remember changed in me, that first day of school I started to feel afraid, drowned, desperate, I just wanted to go out crying and be with my mom. From that day on, every time I knew I had to go to school, I felt that I just wanted to stay at my house with my mom, I began to have those symptoms that continued throughout middle school.

During my middle school years, this anxiety, fear and depression that I felt for having to go to school was decreasing, and it only happened to me when I had to return to school after the holidays, and when I returned to my school routine disappeared, and then anxiety returned every Sunday. (maybe sounds funny but it was real).

During my high school was totally different because the anxiety, the fear and the desperation never manifested. I think high school was my best years. 

On university the problem came back, worst than ever. I'm about a month away from graduating. 

Now im 23 old, today I woke up from bed because I start feeling anxiety (its 2:30am where I live) desperate And I started having suicidal thoughts. 

This week has been harder to me, I feel sad, desperate, anxious.  I have not been able to pay attention to my family, I do not feel the strength to speak to them, just be alone, I can not study for my exams, I am afraid of the future, the past makes me nostalgic, I just wish I could escape from this world.

I’ve been out of work ever since but I’d like to go back...however, the last few months leaving the house is something I really can’t bring myself to do unless I absolutely have to. The last few weeks I barley leave my room and don’t do simple tasks anymore...I’m wondering if this is depression or if it’s because I’m very introverted...I used to love going and running errands but now I just find it draining. Maybe you guys won’t know the answer...Has anyone else gone through something like this? I hope this made sense. I’m sleep deprived.",1

262,"In general over the past 2 months or so I’ve been anxious. 

How long does shortness of breath last? I haven’t felt like I’ve had normal full breaths in a while. Usually at rest I’m ok, but it’s been tough to workout as I quickly run out of breath. 

I feel my anxiety has come down in the past few days, but I still don’t feel like my respiration is 100%. Obviously some times are worse than others... But even at the best these days.. It’s not perfect.. 

Can anyone offer any insight? Specifically I feel like on inhales, I can’t get a full breath. I can exhale just fine it seems like.

The thing is though, I'm going with my boyfriend who is so excited about going. He keeps telling me how much fun we'll have but I'm excited to come back before we've even gone. I feel so awful that I'm having these thoughts again, the stupid thing is we went through this last time we went away and it turned out okay in the end.

264,"Hi guys, longtime lurker here. i had a moment yesterday that made me question some of my actions over the past few years. I had to ship a package last night- super simple right? Nothing big, pretty straight forward- but damn I was anxious about it. Part of me wanted to put it off until the next day (and then the next, and then the next), but there was a deadline involved and I needed to get it done as quick as possible. My anxiety was high as I went in but I got the job done. Afterwards I felt strangely proud of myself-which got me introspecting. I tend to procrastinate about things that I know I want/need to do- like apply to grad school, paint more, do my damn taxes. Why? Because I'm terrified of looking incompetent. I'm terrified of not knowing the right moves or the right words. That fact alone makes me freeze like a deer in the headlights. I don't have a solution yet for this problem except for to do what I procrastinate on which I guess while deeply uncomfortable may help me.  ",1

266,"I’m a freshman (soon-to-be sophomore) at a university, and I’ve personally gone through a lot in my childhood. I’m an emotional abuse victim that suffers from diagnosed depression, diagnosed anxiety, diagnosed PTSD, and suicidal thoughts. I have a lot of social anxiety—it’s hard for me to speak in front of groups or make friends and I’ve even developed a slight stutter sometimes.

Anyway, I’m taking an Arabic class, and I’ve rarely spoken at all because of my anxiety, unless I’ve been called on. There was one time I was so afraid of speaking that after the assistant had me speak a conversation with another student, tears welled up in my eyes and I got really red in the face and the assistant felt really bad and apologized to me. 

Today, my professor called me to his desk to speak to me privately, and handed me my last quiz. He told me I’ve gotten 100’s on all his tests, and I’m his best student, but my grade is a C because I don’t speak up. I immediately cried in front of him, and I felt so embarrassed. He apologized and I apologized for crying. He told me to come to his office hours so we can talk about speaking up more, and I went back to my seat, and cried silently at my desk the entire time. I couldn’t stop. I knew people probably saw me cry, and it made me want to cry more. I’m so terrified of speaking up, but I don’t want my grade to suffer. 

I’ve thought about getting an emotional support animal, but I don’t see a therapist anymore that could write me a letter. I don’t know what to do to handle my depression and anxiety anymore. I still can’t stop crying.

I can't shut off the thoughts of what it'll be like after I wake up.

Every time these thoughts comes back, I break down sobbing just absolutely terrified.

I just keep telling myself to try to make it to Thursday night when I take the first Valium they gave me. And then hopefully the weekend will be filled with me just sleeping through everything.

270,"Ok so i had my physical yesterday and all went well but at the end, my doctor told me she had to tell me something and then told me she was moving locations to be closer to home.

She told me she doesn’t expect me to follow her, but my doctor is sooo great that I don’t want to find another doctor, at least not right now. For someone who is a hypochondriac, she doesn’t look at me like i’m crazy and she always takes the time to reassure me that i’m ok. I’ve been seeing her on average once a month but have been thinking about extending it to every other month or so.

271,"My partner and I live at my parents house. We run a small business which is going ok and is enjoyable but we don't make enough to live on yet and so he works another job. 

Living at home with my parents stresses me out. I love them dearly but they annoy the hell out of me and I feel like an asshole for thinking this way as they've done so much for me, but I can't help feeling miserable every hour I'm home. My mum in particular, we used to be best friends and I have no idea what changed but I find everything she says annoying. I reply with sarcasm and stupid comments because I don't know what else to say and that upsets both of us so I hide away in my room to avoid interaction, but then she gets upset because she's lonely. She doesn't work and I work from home so we're stuck at home together a lot. She also suffers from depression and she knows I do but I can't talk to her about it because she always ends up making it about her problems. 

My brother lives abroad and we were pretty close too but I fell out with him over christmas, and I'm still upset about what happened.

We decided to get a dog 4 months ago and she's so lovely but very reactive outside, and as I'm the only one who takes her out, this stresses me out a lot, which probably makes her reactivity worse - we're stuck in a loop. Inside she's great. But I get stressed out when she's misbehaving or going crazy, my parents make her worse and I'm the only one who knows how to handle it.

I feel like moving out and having my own space would fix so many of my problems, but I can't afford it, and that gets me down.

I've been with my partner 5 years and he's great but I don't feel I can talk to him about how I'm feeling anymore. I'm often crying and I feel like I'm a burden on him. I had a difficult day a couple weeks ago and I told him about it and he was supportive at first and then a few hours later said he's going away for the weekend to see his family (3 hour drive away). I wouldn't mind but it was so sudden and at a time when I needed him and when questioned it came out that my anxiety was stressing him out so he felt the need to run away for a bit. I don't blame him tbh, but he said sorry and didn't go in the end. I now feel like I have to hide my anxiety from him. 

A doctor recommended this book ""Mindfulness: a practical guide to finding peace in a frantic world"", which I bought and started reading but honestly I hate reading and I can't concentrate. I've just contacted this therapy scheme, but I'm kinda worried about how its going to go.

272,"I went to school today and I received a questionnaire about the smoking habits of teenagers. Of course I don’t smoke so I filled in “I don’t smoke” and “I don’t accept people who smoke”.

Then the next part struck me.

It was about the symptoms of smoking and I was required to fill in how often they happen: choose from Never, Sometimes, Often and Always.

To my surprise, I filled in “Often” in most of the questions, and I rarely filled “Never”.

273,"So, I'm in my 30s. I used drugs and drank heavily in my 20s but been clean for years. My memory is pretty bad because of this. I feel like I am remembering a really traumatic event from my childhood, but it seems weird that I wouldn't think of it until now. I also heard that repressed memories are just something made up for movies and tv and it doesn't really happen. I also heard that many people think they are remembering a repressed memory, but it's a false memory.

Anyway, here it is. I don't know what to make of it, but I feel like I have to confess it. I think when I was a kid my grandfather forced me to perform a sex act on him. I remember him telling me to close my eyes and open my mouth and then I felt like I was drowning. Maybe I blacked out. I don't remember the act clearly happening just being confused and terrified. I think I bit him. I remember trying to get away from him. I don't remember much before or after that. I feel like it happened because when I sit with the Idea I get this feeling of genuine sadness. It feels like I could cry even though I haven't been able to physically cry in a long time probably due to depression.

I feel like my whole life was thrown off track from this. I still made my own mistakes, but I feel like I was cheated out of a better life. I'm also afraid that this memory is manufactured to excuse me of guilt for failing to be successful and thrive. I wish there was some way to know, but he's been dead for years now. ",1

This changed for a while, when I went to a party and got drunk for the first time. I finally felt like a ""usual"" person and I was able to talk to anyone I wanted. I loved the feeling so much because it ended my anxiety.

275,"Hey friends, first, I feel like I've posted here 20 times in the last few days (which is an exaggeration, but still). So I just gotta say, I appreciate all of you on this sub.

So I am Going Through It, as many of us are. Anxiety has been through the roof, I've been dealing with a new extreme level of depression since the end of last summer, and because of being underemployed and having chosen theatre as my career path (aka never getting paid for all the work I do outside of my day jobs), I can't afford therapy or really anything that might help lift me out of this well.

I am feeling really resentful towards theatremaking because it is \*exhausting\* and I feel drained and therefore not creative and so all my upcoming artmaking commitments feel like terrible obligations--even though I'm the one that sought them out. And if I was in a better headspace, I would be so excited for them. But as it is, I'm considering cancelling a reading opportunity I was given for early May because I can't get myself to write this play I've been dreaming of for the last two years, and I'm dreading an interview on Thursday for an amazing devising residency over the summer that I've wanted to do for years.

It's all a mess. And I'm starting to wonder if me holding on so tightly to theatre is part of the issue. In the past I've felt like, my depression/anxiety can take a lot away from me, but it can't take my art...but now I'm wondering if I wouldn't be better off taking art off my plate, recentering myself as a human being, and then later on see if artmaking is still something that makes me happy.

But having said all of that (damn, sorry this is so long), I have no idea what kind of work would make me feel happy/fulfilled/not exhausted, if not theatre. My day job is an administrative type gig and I am grateful to have it, but I don't want it to become my life. I also currently live in a huge city, with a partner and a home and pets, and constantly dream of running away to somewhere totally new and starting over then. But still, even in that scenario, I'm like...but what would I do?

So, I guess, IDK I'd love brainstorms of career paths that are doable for someone in their late 20s to get into/start from scratch, that don't totally exhaust you every day. Types of jobs/fields that someone with anxiety and a lot of imagination could thrive in, instead of just survive through. Maybe y'all can't even answer this. I guess it's just, what would make me happy. And I guess I haven't really been happy in so long, so I feel really disconnected from that.

IDK! Share your thoughts if you want! Did you find your dream career path? Did your anxiety inform what kind of career you got into? Do you have a recommendation for what city I should run away form my life and go live in? Wanna make some non-pressure-feeling art with me?",1
276,Has anyone had any luck with this med? I have expressed my fears of taking this medication to my nurse and the Psychiatrist but they don't seem to care. I have asthma and I cannot even take benadryl because of it and I was told this is a massive antihistamine. I am also on Xanax 1mg 4 times a day so this medicine would most likely make the sedation much more intense and labor my breathing. I have Diabetes and this medicine can and does raise your blood sugar. To boot I have high interoccular eye pressure and that is another no no for this med but they put me on it anyway. I need some encouragement so I wanted to see if anyone else had luck with it. They placed me on 25 mg 3 times a day.

I just woke up to what felt like minutes of heart palpitations ( it was probably more like seconds ). I woke up panicked, my heart was fluttering, it felt out of time. I forced myself to stand up to try and fix it. My favourite place to monitor my heartbeat is that bit in the middle of your neck, between the collarbones ( I have a feeling this isn’t at all a good place to measure ). 

I had no other symptoms at this point, just the feeling of heart palps. It took everything in me not to wake my mum and beg her to take me to hospital ( Again ). I have been tested in the past and got the all clear. But my brother died of sudden adult death syndrome and I have had a blood clot in the past where I’ve had to have brain surgery.

So now I’m lying here, heart is beating ok. I have a lot of acid reflux going on and I’m stressed as hell. But I’m telling myself I’m ok. I had no other symptoms other than the heart palps. No fainting, no pain. My heart is probably ok. I’m probably not going to die painfully.

I had a really good week and got to do a bunch of stuff I had been putting off. I was feeling confident since there wasn't too much to do in the near future. So I didn't know what my next 'thing' should be. We agreed that during these three weeks I would get back to working out and figure out what to work on next.

285,"As a child, I was so eager to grow up and act like an adult. I tried to grow up way too fast. Now that I'm 27, I just wish I could go back to being a kid and being under my parents care. I know how bizarre that sounds.

I graduated from college early with a Bachelor's degree and strong GPA, I have a full-time job and live in an apartment with my boyfriend. Outwardly, I look like a decent success, I suppose. But I worry that this is my plateau. The thought of buying a house makes me feel like I could throw up. The thought of getting married is terrifying. I do hate being the center of attention and I think that the thought of marriage scares me in large part because I hate, hate, hate being the center of everyone's attention, having parties thrown for me, etc. Cannot stand it one bit.

I am getting sick of living in an apartment and having to share parking spots and common areas with other people who don't care as much about their space as I do. I'd like to get married, I really do want to. I love my boyfriend - he is everything I've dreamed of in a guy. He's smart, hilarious, caring, and a really hard worker. I couldn't ask for anything else, and yet I'm so terrified of taking the next step. But I do want these things so bad, I am just so anxious. I overthink every decision and I'm going to let life pass me by. 

I feel like I need to talk to someone I trust about these things, but I'm so terrified because any time I've expressed hesitation to the people around me, they say, ""Well, clearly he's not the right guy if you aren't down right excited about buying a house with him and getting married."" But I strongly disagree with that. I don't ever want to break up with him and he's so great. Breaking up with him and finding someone else is not the answer, because if I'm lucky enough to find another person as great as him (which, to be honest, I don't know that I could), I'll end up in this same nervous position that I am now.

I also need to recognize that I've NEVER been excited about any life-altering decisions, even the ones that have been so amazing. Choosing a high school? Terrifying, didn't feel satisfied with my choice in the beginning but it turned out fine. College? I absolutely DID NOT want to go. The thought of moving out and leaving my parents nagged at me. That first weekend of school, I sat and cried in my dorm room. But once I finally took the leap and started making friends and going out? I was in heaven! Any time I've switched jobs, I've had horrible nerves and anxiety about it. But this most recent job I took was probably one of the best decisions for my mental health because the company and the job is so, so much better than where I was before. I never think, ""Hey, that was such a good decision!"" until well after the decision is made. Up until making the decision and even for a bit after it, I'm thinking, ""Shit, think of all the things that could go wrong. This is probably a massive mistake.""

So what am I going to do? I feel like these feelings of terror and anxiety say to everyone else that I must be in a bad relationship, but I'm not. I'm never going to get over these feelings no matter who the person is. I feel like I suck, I feel a bit worthless honestly. I don't know what to do from here. I feel so stuck where I am right now and like there is no way out.",1
286,"I’m 16M, and might delete this post later.

I don’t know why, but I feel like everyone acts different to me in an odd way (including my family). I’ll just say this shortly. Whenever I try to talk to my brothers, they’ll ignore me or say something like “that’s cool” afterwords, or when I show them something that I find amusing (like memes or a dumb vid), every single time they”ll say “that’s funny” with a straight face, and my mom will talk to me with a high pitch voice all the time. Other people besides my family, they just kinda ignore me. It feels like I’m been treated like an 11 year old.

I never see my brothers act different to each other, I’m the only one. And there friends are completely chill when they hangout, it’s the opposite for me.

(I don’t know if this post is the right place. If it isn’t, I’m sorry.)",1
287,"I'm not sure if this is relevant, but I'm 17 and my friend group consists of people ages 15-19. I've been diagnosed with Generalized Anxiety Disorder, and have had [Selective Mutism](https://selectivemutismcenter.org/whatisselectivemutism/) (SM) since I was 4 (wasn't diagnosed until I was 7 or 8).

Back in early September of last year I was added to a Skype groupchat by a family friend (15F, nickname KT for privacy's sake) of mine, who I considered my best friend at the time. Being someone with SM, I couldn't talk to them. It wasn't until about a month and a half later that I finally spoke (which is the quickest I've ever spoken to anyone--before then, it was one year, though the vast majority of people in my life haven't heard my voice in 12 years). I was already pretty close to them before I spoke, but talking brought us even closer. We were a tightly-knit family.

Now, it's April and we don't have as many group video calls as we used to. KT and I aren't as close, as I have come to realize how toxic of a friend she is (I don't want to cause drama, so I haven't done anything about it). We're all very active in our iMessage groupchat (which, surprisingly, all 20+ of us have an iPhone), and continue to regularly share memes on our other groupchats on Instagram, Snapchat, and Twitter. I'm pretty sure we have a Discord chat, too. Many of us have already met (all but about 3 of us live in the same state). We have another group meeting planned for next week. Everyone within the group has their own tiny groups (some simple pairs because they live extremely close to one another, others small groups of a few people for aligned interests), though we all remain as one giant friend circle. We make the long distance work out, and there's hardly ever any drama.

However, because I have anxiety and SM has hindered me from experiencing the average person's social life, I can barely hold a conversation. I rarely talk to any of them one-on-one. The ones that I do talk to, though, rarely do or don't give me the same excitable energy I give them. I understand that phones go both ways, but I'm aware how many of them easily text each other outside the main groupchat. In a group of 20+ people, how could none of them have bothered to text me once? There are some who I text first, yet don't get a response back from.

I started to overthink it, and took a small break from the groupchats (I was added back almost immediately, though). Because leaving didn't work, I muted them and haven't taken a look at what they're saying. I know it doesn't seem like a big deal, but I even removed emojis from everyone's names (except for one person, though I never text him). I emotionally detached, and don't feel the same joy I used to get when I see any text messages from them (after leaving, a few reached out to me privately).

This sucks a lot because this is the kindest, most drama-free friend group I've ever been in. They're my family and the only people I talk to these days (aside from family). As mentioned before, they're my main friend group--in reality, they're my only friend group. I don't want to lose them because I keep doing these things. I'm sabotaging myself.

What should I do?",1

Dry mouth, shakes, mainly having anxiety about having anxiety. Although when I start to experience the shakes I do prevent myself from having a full blown fight/flight situation. I can somehow control that but I don't know if that's good or bad? I had 2 crying spells last night while talking to my friend about it. (I avoid talking about it so I won't have think about it)

Also, the worst part is - I cannot sleep. I'm experiencing a weird situation where I'm about to drift off into a nice sleep but my anxiety will wake me right back up. It's like my brain doesn't want me to sleep. It's the kind of sensation you get when you are sleeping sitting up and your head falls to the side and you jerk it back up. Has anyone ever experienced this? The past 2 sleepless nights haven't been fun. I've tried the mediation apps, they aren't really working for me. My body/brain is still waking me up once I drift. I even went back to gym tonight (after months) and did cardio for over an hour to tire myself out and took Melatonin with no luck.

I took 200mg L-Theanine yesterday morning and I felt great (could have just been exhaustion and coffee, though) Because when I took another 200mg pill around 5pm, I felt nothing. I also took a 250mg of Magnesium Cirate and still did not help me fall asleep with ease. (P.S. I tried magnesium glycinate yesterday and it made me super sick) 

I hope I'm not alone on this strange sleeping problem. I don't know how long I can go on with this, I'm thinking of just going to a psychiatrist. I'm just really disappointed that I let myself get like this again. Should I just go see a doctor? I really don't want to be on medication but it's truly a struggle. Any advice or suggestions would be so greatly appreciated. Thank you!

293,"I work at a shitty gas station, it's been about 10 months and I'm just now getting paid more than the bare minimum. I'm always on edge from the store duties and people. Whenever I have even a little confrontation with a customer I shake so much I can barely speak straight. Today I had a customer threathen to beat me up for being rude to ""his girl"" . Wasn't even being rude just confused as to what she was talking about. She wasn't explaining it clearly at all so I was trying to figure it out.
     He started just talking shit basically and I just kept saying ""okay"" until they left. Afterwards I called my mother and had a breakdown from all the stres that's been building up. I'm trying to stay there until a full year, but I don't know if I can pull through. ",1

295,"Hello! This is my first post here. I’ve been diagnosed with anxiety and medicated with sertraline since I was 16. (Now 25). 

My wife and I listed our house back a few months ago and after two long months finally sold it. We had our inspection last week and as expected some items came up. All but one mostly small things. The one big thing is that they want the outside air conditioner piece replaced as they’re claiming it’s been damaged by dog pee. We have female dogs so there’s no way that’s the case. It was hit with a weed wackier around the bottom and was dirty. We explained this to them but they insist it’s dog pee and needs replaced. To replace the unit would cost anywhere from 2-4k. 

Long, boring details aside, it’s keeping me up at night. We got their response to our proposed fixes two hours ago and now it’s past midnight and I still can’t stop thinking about it. We already have another house lined up that is our dream home and the thought of losing it because we can’t sell ours really sucks. I know that we could be in much worse a spot (actual problems like health) or barely surviving but between not knowing why the buyers won’t be reasonable and the thought of how disappointed my wife will be if this doesn’t work out is really eating me up inside.

(Prozac,Wellbutrin,Cymbalta,Zoloft, and Celexa,valerian root, GABA,NAC. The only medicine that seems to work for me is Kava tea but it doesn't have a long duration.

302,"I've always had some issues with social and performance anxiety. I've been working hard on that for a while now and it's been getting better, to the point where I can at least fake my way through most situations or relationships. Girls have always been a source of stress, but frankly Tinder has made casual relationships fairly simple. 

I met a girl a couple weeks ago at a club event that I forced myself to go to and we immediately hit it off. Great chemistry, shared interests, this is easily the most interested I've been in a girl in at least 5 years. We've hung out twice now, and so begins the issue. 

I can't eat without being sick. I can't sleep. Can't go to the gym because I'm tired, hungry, and nauseous pretty much constantly. I have the ""shakes"" even when not consciously thinking about her. I've lost 6 pounds in two weeks. Only time I've felt ok is on the motorcycle, and that's because it requires all your focus. Only time I've slept more than five hours in the last two weeks was from taking a benzo that may or may not have been prescribed. I can talk to her casually fine, but I can't escalate anything. It's like all this crap I thought I was over came back and is smashing me in the face at the most inopportune time. I feel like I'm back in middle school with a crush, and it sucks.

305,"I’ve been dealing with major anxiety now for about 15 years (32 now). It comes out a lot in social situations and also at work when talking to people especially of higher ranking in meetings.

Unfortunately, it also comes out pretty hard on sports when playing in something group oriented rather than 1-on-1. I played sports throughout my childhood and high school and never had issues but my anxiety has crippled my sport playing ability to the point I look like someone who’s never played in his life. I either overthink everything (throwing, catching, batting) so it doesn’t come out right, or my heart just races uncontrollably, my stomach feels like it’s sinking, and my legs shake and my mind just won’t turn off (pleas god don’t fuck up) thoughts. I noticed though if I’m randomly having a good game, the anxiety subsides a bit. But as soon as one bad play happens, it dominos badly and it just gets worse from there.

Tonight was probably the worst of all. 1 for 3 batting, already had a dropped flyball and with 2 outs, last inning, ahead by 1, bases loaded......I drop the easiest flyball hit directly at me. As the ball came to me I literally just panicked, made contact, and it just bounced off my glove. We lost. One of the most embarrassing moments of my life and the team wouldn’t even look at me after. 

I think I’m gonna drop out of this league as I’m embarrassed to even show my face after this. Sad part is, playing catch with a friend or going to batting cages, I do amazing. But as soon as I’m in social setting, anxiety comes and I can’t play whatsoever. Wish I could just turn it off but I can’t. :(

Probably gonna cry myself to sleep tonight. Feel so unbelievably emasculated. ",1

My boss gave me a project where I have to arrange a meeting with contractors that work for us, and discuss the errors they are making.

I send out the emails, and are awaiting response, but even having my work phone near me makes me feel nervous.

309,"Would you offer a seat to someone wearing a ‘please offer me a seat’ badge on a train? 

Does anyone else wear this badge? 

I’ve recently got this badge for my train journey everyday to and from work, which is of course really busy and there are never seats available (public transport in the UK is horrific!). 

I suffer from anxiety, and at its worst I feel very faint and nauseous. Due to an experience a few months ago, I’m now terrified of being sick on the train and have crippling anxiety whenever I’m on the train, ESPECIALLY when I have to stand up. I experience many physical symptoms that make it really difficult to stand for a length of time and is a horrible start to my day at work. I often have to spend 10 minutes calming myself down before going to work. 

So it’s day 2 of wearing the badge, and I’m currently stood on the train. I’ve noticed that people seem to glance and glance away. Everyone is just looking down on phones/reading books (me included) so no one seems to notice at all. Yesterday I asked someone if I could sit down and of course he offered his seat no questions asked, but that just spiked my anxiety worrying about what judgements everyone was making about me. 

Does anyone have any suggestions how to make this easier? ",1

I compulsively destroy the skin on my fingers and I can’t seem to stop. 

Most of the time I do it without even realizing it or paying attention. I’ll just look down at my hand or I’ll feel the stinging of my fingers and I’ll just know it’s getting bad again. I don’t know when this became an outlet for my anxiety, but it’s become such a natural thing for me to do in response to stress of any kind that my hands always look awful and they always hurt. 

I can’t wear winter gloves 24/7 because people have to use their bare hands sometimes. I can’t cover my fingertips in bandaids because even waterproof ones get flimsy and don’t want to stay on after a few hours. I’m so frustrated and idk what to do. Sometimes I can go a few days of doing it less and I realize how much better my hands look, but it only takes a few minutes of losing my self control for it to get so bad again. 

Thanks to anyone who read this. I know it’s gross and shameful but I just feel so crappy and I want to stop. I want to wear cute nail polish and have nice soft hands, and more than anything I don’t want to feel this stinging pain that’s nearly constant at this point. ",1
311,"Things have been a mess ever since last summer, they would get gradually better and then something would rear its ugly head and knock me back down a step. Husband went to work, his gout flared up and he had to call in one day because he couldn't walk only that evening to find out that the shutdown basically was going to keep him home for awhile. Then he gets better, and gets a nice interview where things sound great and we both got the Flu. Then, once we both got over the flu, things start looking like it is going to pick back up and he gets gout AGAIN in both knees and feet. I guess I should have explained when he gets gout, I have to take over all the errands and whatever running has to be done. We have no siblings at all, his parents are dead and mine....well they wouldn't piss on fire to put me out. So it all fell on me. Then the gout clears up, he goes to the Dr and we find out that he is looking at Stage 2 Kidney failure which is causing these gout flare ups so to speak because his kidneys aren't pushing the uric acid out of his system like they normally should be doing. I made a decision that he doesn't need to be the one worrying about working and I start applying to every single job I can find like a madwoman. 

I got a nice job starting at the end of the month and we are so close to getting everything lined out. Only problem is I am worried that something is going to throw a monkey wrench in everything yet again. It seems like we have the worst luck in the world. We are waiting for his check to come in so we can get the tags renewed on the car and get some food in the house, not to mention get us moved from where we are right now. 

All this mess even though its a good mess right now, is causing me to worry and stress because I am scared that something will go wrong. I know its life, and life is never fair but for once I would like to have a break. I would love for the check to come in tomorrow (which I know it won't, it will be early next week I think), and us be moved within the next 2 weeks. We are simple people and don't have much to get moved so it won't take but maybe 1 or 2 loads of stuff to go to a new place. We will have plenty of money but my goodness I wish that stinking check would come in already. I did post over on the borrow subreddit but no one is biting and I can understand because I haven't gotten any history over there. It is so close to everything being straightened out finally for once and I can't wait but man it is causing me to not sleep worth a diddly do.

I wish I had never been stricken with Anxiety, but I do know that I could have gotten dealt a worse hand than I did in life. 

Just keep us in your thoughts guys, we are wanting to get out of this dump we live in so badly. It costs so much to get moved and we are finally going to be able to get out of here and never look back. There is mold in the ceilings and the bathroom walls, the water messed up and it has basically no pressure (not a plumber and can't fix it, plumber quoted me over 250 dollars), the stove quit working and the fridge door literally fell off in my hands about 2 weeks ago. When it rains, it pours around here LOL. Thing is, the ceiling leaks so when it rains it REALLY POURS LOL. I have to laugh about somethings or I will break down and cry. But we are close, so close.

I don't like or want to talk to my parents about this so that's why i'm here.  I have gone to counseling before.  My panic attacks have mostly stopped by now however me just feeling anxious is killing me...

I am only two days in spring break now and i'm feeling more anxious than I was when I was in school making me not want summer break to come..  How do I deal with this, I can't deal with some of the physical symptoms either, numb hands, or feel like there not there, feeling hot, etc.  How do you guys deal with this?",1
315,"Hey guys, first post here. If people are triggered by suicidal thoughts, alcohol abuse, or drunken/sleepy sex, perhaps give this one a miss.

&amp;#x200B;

This is something that has really worn me down. Basically, at a party I threw my ex and I got very very drunk. I had to carry her up the stairs, in fact, and dump her on my bed. She often needed carrying after nights out just because she didn't want to walk anywhere, or because she wanted to doze or whatever- she was a real lightweight.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway, the issue is that being extremely drunk and in a committed relationship where we both got super drunk every week and had sex after nights out, sometimes multiple times, I initiated sex with her, kissing her neck and generally trying to arouse her. I remember thinking there is no way I would do this with anyone else as they might not like it, but it's ok with her. Kind of like how in the middle of the night you'd wake up your SO by doing similar to have sex. She was moaning and seemed awake but very sleepy, eyes shut- basically, about to doze off. I did most of the work in getting her undressed, as she was basically out of it. Remember at this point I am also hammered beyond belief. She rolls over a little, and then it gets hazy. I remember more kissing and rolling around on my bed, and the feeling of being in her as she moaned in her normal way- i.e. not a way that suggested anything wrong- and then having sex hard on the floor (something we did occasionally).

&amp;#x200B;

Now, remember, this is my anxiety riddled account. A couple of days after, she asked me if she had indeed needed carrying up- I said yeah, cause she was barely able to stand (I think- am not actually sure-she'd taken a seat and walking her proved to be difficult, especially with the steep stairs, so I think that's why I carried her up). Then she asked if anything else happened she would want to know, so I told her a couple of other things then that we'd had sex for hours. Her response was ""hours"" (as a joke, I assume) and then to say that she hoped no one heard us. 

&amp;#x200B;

Fast forward a year or so. We've split in unrelated circumstances. I have to help a friend home in similar circumstances, and it gets me thinking of that time. So I begin to obsess. The details in my head change constantly, and I keep scouring reddit for help- but then I get this notion locked in my head that I've raped her, as that's the response you get when you type in my ""bf had sex with me when I was wasted"" into google. Now, here's the bit that fucks with me. I was freaking out didn't eat or sleep for nigh on 24 hours and had been drinking the night before, and contemplating ending it all, so I called my dad who called her (I don't have her number to hand, but he has my old phone at home). He explained the situation to her and what I was afraid of, including details such as the date and the location, and she was apparently very polite and sincere in saying she thinks our memories differed and that she was awake and she was fine (I only ever threw one party at that house). Obviously this helped immeasurably...at first.

&amp;#x200B;

I've fallen into a pattern of constantly needing reassurance, either from my current gf, my dad, or from arbitrary things like coin flips. Like ""Heads if you're ok"", ""If you did it a boulder will crush you, or lightning will hit you"", that kind of thinking. I don't know what I'm looking for exactly, maybe some tips for dealing with this. I know this constant need for reassurance is perhaps a symptom of OCD. 

&amp;#x200B;

My RATIONAL mind, along with everyone else I talk to IRL about this says ""Obviously, a dumb thing to have done. Could have been very messy. BUT she has no reason to lie. Probably what it was is that she was fuzzy on the details, but remembers the fact of the sex itself. Hell, if you'd had sex with no memory whatsoever of it you'd probably at least be like ""we did?"" And let's not forget, she had no issue calling you out for doing bad things (of a different magnitude and nature) when you were drunk before""

&amp;#x200B;

Other brain ""But what if she just wants me to buzz off? What if my dad lied so I won't kill myself? What if he paid her off? What if she saw it as I'm imagining it and would feel violated?""

Stuff there is no EVIDENCE for, but that I obsess over all the same. I'm very vulnerable in posting this here

I've been cleaning, cooking every day, packing him lunches etc, just to try to be more helpful and put less stress on him.

But he's withdrawing really hard and it scares me. He's always been a bit introverted and quiet when it comes to conversation, but he said maybe three sentences to me today. I asked him if everything is okay, and I can see it written all over his face that it's not. I've been with him for 13 years and I can tell when something isn't right. And tonight was the first time he wouldn't talk to me. I didn't try to push him into talking, but I did express my feelings about him hardly speaking to me, and now I feel like an asshole because I just added to his stress. 

And of course with the anxiety, my mind is jumping to the worst possible scenarios. His job in the military has one of the highest rates for suicide, so I'm worried about that.

Ever since I had a really bad panic attack several months ago I've become much more reserved than I used to be. For example, I have this fear of travelling too far nowadays incase I have a panic attack and can't get home so feel a sense of being trapped. As well as this, my mum and dad are away on holiday currently so I'm home alone. Usually being home myself would be great and I'd look forward to it. But now since the bad anxiety I hate being alone. The weird thing is though theyve been gone for two days. Yesterday the first night (I was fine) tonight though I'm WIDE AWAKE worrying about not sleeping for work tomorrow and just can't seem to turn off. 

Also I've got the hospital in two days because I've been having a pain in my eye/head so of course I'm thinking the worst about that. 

How do you guys stop yourselves from overthinking? Currently watching parks and rec after turning it off before going to bed (then having a panic attack so put it back on) I'm in one of those horrible ruts where I'll jump to conclusions and think too far in the future like what I mentioned about having work tomorrow.

Always feeling anxious, insecure and jealous, it mustn’t be healthy. Someone please tell me I’m not alone",1
328,"It was a really stupid debate about Elon Musk. 
Nonetheless the debate led into me talking about marketing (my major that I’m graduating in 1 month with). 

I left that debate feeling pretty peeved. I felt like they weren’t wanting to here me out, and that they wanted to tell me what my own major was. They boiled my major down into advertising and social media. At that point I quit debating because it was obvious that their points were coming from a place of ignorance on the very subject we were debating. 

It’s not the first time they’ve made comments about my major being “easy”. Sometimes they’ll see the median salary for a digital marketing job I’m applying for and say, “YOU CAN GET PAID $X JUST TO TWEET?!” Obviously digital marketing encompasses a TON more, especially in the last couple of years. It’s just really annoying when they say that kind of stuff. 

I’m graduating from a top business school with my degree, and it makes me feel like I wasted my major even though I love it. Marketing is kind of a misfit in the business world because it melds together data and creativity. I just think the creativity side makes people discount its difficulty. 

Part of me just needed to vent because I know it was stupid but I am still hurt and stressed about it. I’ve been up for 2.5 hours exclusively thinking about it. I just want support and open mindedness from my friends to learn about the basics of my passions. Instead it’s just assumed they already know. Ugh. I need to leave this spiral. 

PS: I have not taken my meds today and need to pick up my refill tomorrow morning so part of it could be from that. ",1
329,I am going to be honest I used to have a porn and masterbation addiction. I have been over a year “clean” if that is the right term. I have been feeling extremely disturbed while being intimate with my Significant other. My mind tells me to think of this “porn actress”. I do not have any images that come to my mind but the name does and it causes me extreme distress.  The thoughts do not make me think about being with them or anything they just come to my head and say “think of this....”. I do not know if anyone else has gone through something like this. I feel like I am a horrible person and my mind is telling me I am purposely thinking of these things when I know I am not. I am trying to stay in the moment and my mind pulls me back to dark days and then tells me this is what you wanted and I know it isn’t true. It just tears me down and makes me feel dysfunctional.,1

333,"I’ve struggled with Panic Attacks since I was 18. I didn’t start having regular ones until I was 20. I never noticed the anxiety I had even when I was younger until these started happening. I’ve always been anxious in social situations ever since I was in elementary school and then I went into a career field that forced me to interact with complete strangers regularly (EMS). This is when they started coming on regularly. 

I was put on 0.25mg of Xanax as needed (never took it while working) and then the Panic Attacks started to change, the symptoms changed and I would legitimately feel like I was going crazy. I was having them pretty much every day. I started seeing a Psychologist, at the recommendation of my PCP, because I hated being on meds. I was diagnosed as having Panic Attacks with Agoraphobia. 

As of May 2016 I haven’t taken any anxiety meds like I was before (except when I needed an MRI). I thought I had learned to successfully stop them and it worked up until January this year. 

On my birthday, I had some kind of an allergic reaction to my cake and woke up to a swollen upper lip but no other symptoms (so, it could have been too much sodium that caused it too). 4 days later I ate the same cake and within 10 minutes I thought I was going to go into anaphylaxis. I was freaking out and could not stop it no matter how hard I tried. 

Since then, I’ve had a handful of times now where I’ve eaten something that is not new to me and freaked out thinking I was starting to have symptoms of anaphylaxis. I am completely rationale in my thought process. I KNOW I am not allergic to these things but I still go into a full Panic Attack most of the time. Has anyone dealt with this/is anyone currently dealing with something similar? It’s driving me insane!",1

341,"Greetings /r/Anxiety,

I wanted to post this here to collect my thoughts and hopefully get some external help understanding what exactly this feeling in my chest (metaphorically) is. I read over the posting rules and hopefully none of this violates it. I'm not asking for a diagnosis but rather I wouldn't even know how to describe these feelings to a professional if I did seek help.

I recently found myself in an odd position where I have a mental health *issue*, but it's not really an emergency issue. For context: I am in my mid-twenties and have happily been in a long term relationship since I was 16. I also had a rather (emotionally) rough childhood between regular school bullies and an unsupportive father figure that, when combined with the fact that I never really had the chance to explore myself or date others, I don't really have a lot of experience with ""Exploring myself"" emotionally. I would easily say I'm a little stunted on my emotional growth due to these circumstances, which is why I'm so confused about my situation or even how to describe it. So, *here's my problem*:

*I am a self-control freak.* I don't mean like ""haha watch me do this crazy thing without freaking out"" kind of self-control, rather I literally cannot even fathom what it's like to not have control over one's own body and my mind instinctively fights losing control. There are two situations recently that have really turned this from curiosity to a nagging source of worry whether I should seek some sort of counseling or mental health help. 

First, very recently my partner and I both got drunk. Like, drunker than we've ever been, just to see how it feels. We're big guys and making the kind of drinks we like is expensive, so it takes a lot of money and alcohol to actually get drunk. My partner was barely able to walk, he's rolling on the floor, laughing, crying over how delicious the corndog he's eating is, having a gay old time. Meanwhile, I'm sitting there just thinking about how hard it is to walk like this and what we would do if something bad were to happen while we're impaired like this. Yes, I could feel that the alcohol was slowing me down, but otherwise I literally felt completely normal other than the coordination issues. I was honestly a little jealous that I didn't seem to feel like a different person like my partner.

Second, we recently attended a party with some friends and strangers that ended in a rousing game of Truth or Truth -- nobody actually wanted to come up with any dares because we were really just trying to get to know one another. One of the questions that came up was ""What is your greatest fear?"". Several regular answers came up, either spiders, or snakes, heights, etc., while mine were tied with two very related answers: Dying to an uncontrollable situation, such as a plane crash, bus crash, etc., or getting stuck. Not like a claustrophobic stuck, but getting literally stuck in a situation where you have to wait for either death or someone to come rescue you.

A few days after the party, I sort of came to the creeping realization that all of this might be related and that maybe there's something not normal with how I feel. This was only exacerbated by reading articles about Ayahuasca and Psilocybin causing some people to break down these great walls and feel like different people after their experiences with it. This is obviously not an option as I live in America where these things are illegal.

I have this constant nagging feeling like I need to find a way to release control, to the point that I can actually feel it in my chest like a source of stress whenever it's on my mind. Is this Anxiety? Is this some form of OCD symptom? Is this literally just some form of jealousy or frustration that I just need to get over? I've tried googling this feeling but it just comes up with advice on how to better control yourself, which is the exact opposite of what I *think* I want.",1
342,"           So, I have been looking up articles and essays on social anxiety because I think I may have it. I'm not completely sure if I really do have it or if I'm just being dramatic. I have had what i think are anxiety attacks twice now, and the most difficult one happened in an overcrowded Cosco.        
There were too many people, and the building just seemed really small, and there was so much noise that it just all mashed together until I felt like I couldn t breathe- I don't know if I was overreacting or have a real attack, but it got better (not by much, but still better) once i was out in the parking lot and could see the sky. I'm kind of afraid/nervous to go back into a grocery store. This happened a month ago and I still haven't gone into a grocery store yet. Would anyone be able to tell me if I am overreacting or if I have anxiety. I would really like to know if I should see a doctor or something else. Thank you.",1

346,I do not speak Spanish fluently and am barely capable of having a conversation with someone in Spanish but am pretty good at reading to it and listening to it. The teacher today announced that we would be doing improv which meant no papers whatsoever. I started to panic a bit but calmed down when she said we would have 20 minutes to practice. However the person I was supposed to practice with is also not well versed in Spanish and she started getting panicky as well. I really started to freak out but then the teacher announced that we would be completely switching partners after and I ended up with someone who is quite good in Spanish. I tried to do it but couldn’t and eventually started tearing up and couldn’t control myself. My friend and I left the classroom and went to the washroom where I started hyperventilating and eventually fainted. The next part I only know from what I was told but she apparently ran out to the hallway to get my teacher who came and rubbed me awake and she also got our Vice Principal who is in charge of this sort of thing and I lay on the floor 10 minutes with my friend and her. Meanwhile my teacher left and proceeded to tell the entire class that I was crying because I was stressed out than after I fainted told the entire class I fainted which kind of pissed me off. Anyways after they sorted it all out the vice principal called my dad who was less then thrilled to have to pick me up. I’m thinking the teacher may have gotten in to some sort of trouble possibly because I saw her talking with our principal after while he was taking notes and I overheard heard him talking about it with the vice principal. We took home my friend as well because we where at school for longer than expected. Just looking for tips for afterwards. I’m not looking forward to all my teachers finding out and for what the teacher is gonna say to see me on Thursday when I have her again.,1
347," After realizing that I stupidly left my keys in the washer, I stopped it in the middle of a cycle to retrieve them. For about 5 minutes, I inhaled laundry pod-saturated air, and I felt slightly lightheaded and lethargic after emerging from the laundry. For the past couple of weeks, I've had minor headaches and felt less mentally able generally. I'm having trouble concentrating, word-finding, reasoning, writing, and memorizing, though I'm unsure whether the detergent inhalation has anything to do with it. Is there a way to definitively determine whether the detergent inhalation impaired my cognition? I understand that my symptoms may stem from anxiety or paranoia, but then again, inhaling concentrated cleaning chemicals for 5 minutes could very well have neurological consequences. I appreciate HONEST responses, even if they're blunt.

The problem is that I feel very scared about talking to my parents about it. I'm not sure exactly why. I think I'm self conscious that I'm trying to fit in with my friends that have anxiety by just speculating that I have mental health disorders. Or that I'm being over dramatic. It's not like my parents are mean about these things or anything, so they should be sympathetic.

360,"I've always suffered from self esteem issues and anxiety. I worked on myself a lot and I was very happy with where I had come. I lost 40kg, became comfortable in my own skin, everything. Then i got into a relationship and everything changed. This is my first relationship. 

&amp;#x200B;

I just became dependent on my girlfriend, always judging how she feels about me by trivial stuff like the frequency of her texts, her mood, everything. The problem is, everything will be going great and then a small thing would trigger my anxiety and everything goes south from there. I was very happy this week that finally things were going great. Yesterday we were meant to meet up after work and when i texted her after she finished if I should come over, she said maybe come over in 2 hours, I need to get some stuff done.

That triggered my anxiety and I spiraled. That just made me think that if she really loved me she'd like to spend as much time with me as possible. She has told me on numerous occasions that she has got a very tough schedule with med school and she has to put herself first sometimes so she can put me first. I just cant seem to understand this. I always take her wanting time or space to herself personally. My mind immediately goes to the worst case scenario, the fact that she's distancing herself and she doesnt want to spend time with me. I think I'm starting to become obsessive, I'm always checking when she was online, wondering what she's doing etc.

Im the type of person that recharges after spending time with the people I love. She recharges by being by herself. I just dont get how to deal with this and the anxiety piles up and takes all my motivation away to go about my day.

363,"Hello. New person here. :3
I just want to share how my anxiety has begun and developed since I got it. There isn't really any real reason other than that.
I'm sorry if that is not allowed. :i

I'm a 19 y/o girl from Denmark. Here, we have a different school system. After going through public school for 10 years, we can choose to go to a gymnasium for 3 years. After that, we can go to universities.

I'm in my last year and will finish this summer. Though my anxiety started to show halfway through the gymnasium, winter of 2018. I was kinda stressing about grades at that point but it wasn't really bad. I didn't notice anything before a philosophy class where I answered something wrong. My first thought was to just dig my nail into my forarm. And so I did. I didn't worry and just went on with my life. I had a few anxiety symptoms in the following months but I didn't really care. It wasn't until I got a full-blown anxiety attack that I though to myself ""Maybe something is wrong..""
In June, the exams started. Up until this point, I had a few more attacks but I kept it to myself. I only had two exams so it was okay. But just before my chemistry exam, I had yet another anxiety attack. I overcame the anxiety just as it was my turn. I ended out with a B+ so yay. At this point, I had a feeling that I might have gotten anxiety. I'm not fast. xD

While all this was happening, I somehow drunkenly flirted me to my current bf, who is trying his best to be helpful.

The summer break was anxiety free. So I figured that my anxiety was connected to school. My theory was proven right after the summer. School started and so did the anxiety. It just picked up from where is left. It was beginning to tear at my self confidence at this point which didn't make things better. On top of that, I began to self-harm with my nails and scissors (I'm hella scared of knifes). Faster down the rabbit hole I went.
It was starting to affect my everyday life before I actually told my friends and bf about it. Seeing how sad my selfharm made them, made me stop pretty fast. They all agreed that I should talk to my doctor about anxiety. My response was something like ""It's fine. Don't worry about it. It will pass."" Spoiler alert. It didn't pass.

In the start, my anxiety was rooted in school and grades. But is slowly moved to the fear that my bf would leave me. This made my relationship with him a bit harder since some of the thing he does, would give me anxiety. I also started to communicate less with him about my anxiety because I hate to feel like a burden. Luckily, we are a good match and we normally find a way to talk about it. 
Around this point, I also started to apologize a lot. Even for things that I had nothing to do with. I only apologize when I feel guilt, but I felt it often so said sorry a lot. 

After a couple of weeks, my friends finally convinced me to talk to a doctor about it. I started talking to a psychologist in December, almost a year after the first symptoms. The first few sessions was pretty useful but I have now (April 2019) come to a point, where I don't feel like talking to The Man (that's what I can the psychologist) helps anything anymore.
I have started to selfharm again with nails, pens and bitting. In the last 6 months, I have only had two anxiety attacks though; both with my bf next to me to help and hold me.

So right now, I'm living in the fear that I will fail all my classes and the love of my life with leave me. Neither of my parents know (I keep it from them for personal reasons) but the people who knows are super supportive and I really appreciate that.
Unrelated but kinda related: I'm going to the doctor tomorrow to get tested for adah.

If you got this far, I'm sorry if it was super boring. I just felt like this was the right place to tell my story.

Prepare yourselves, you're in for a ramble...

&amp;#x200B;

Work: I am in Accounts Payable (43k/yr - CAN) and took on HR duties a month into my promotion. I work in the same office as my supervisor (Controller), Arthur, and I hate him most days. He listens to the same grungy, 2000's emo rock playlist EVERYDAY on speakers...EVERY DAY. I have legitimately thought about taking a pair of scissors to his speaker cord when he leaves (because I'm here earlier than him and later than him every day) and blame it on mice or something. When I started working 2 job duties it was a cake walk and I really enjoyed it. But then we hit year end, management wanted to hire many employees at once, and I was/am required to coach the receptionist (that was my job before this one) on the things management is nitpicking about. ALSO just last week I was getting reemed by the owner of our company for not getting applications quick enough so we can get some new staff (because I have control over how popular our job ads are and how many resumes are submitted as a result). I am also getting reemed by him because our current receptionist isn't meeting his standards, which should be ARTHUR's job to coach one of his underlings BUT NO...IT""S ME...THE ONE EMPLOYEE WHO MAKES LESS THAN HALF OF WHAT OUR SUPERVISOR, ARTHUR, MAKES.

 I have no time to catch up. My desk is a mess. The only way I'll possibly be able to catch up is to work OT, which I don't get paid for. Speaking of pay, I never received a salary compensation or any kind of compensation when I started working TWO jobs in one. Nothing. I was just expected to work HR alongside Accounts Payable at the same time and stay at the same salary. My annual performance review is in a week so I plan to ask for a fair salary increase but in the meantime I'm about ready to scream.

&amp;#x200B;

Dogs: I've posted on Reddit before, about my sick dog, and this is one of the biggest triggers in my life. My beautiful old man poodle, Sunny, has Congestive Heart Failure (2 years now) and Kidney Disease (since January). We decided to continue medication for his CHF and just treat the KD with special kibble. This is a HUGE financial strain. Just in May (yes next month) I will be paying minimum $350 for prescription refills (to last 3 months before I get to do that again). Additionally, one of his diuretics costs me $45/month. I was playing around with my projected budget today and realized that if any emergency were to happen with him that required any extensive vet care, or the vet recommends an increase in prescription dosage to make him comfortable, I would not be able to afford it. I would have to put him to sleep because I failed on budgeting properly - thus failing him.

&amp;#x200B;

Finances: So yes, I'm butt-ash broke. I get paid a nice salary but I don't feel it's appropriate to my work load, and my expenses far outweigh my salary. I pay for a sick dog, Trudeau instilled a carbon tax which will increase bills, my car payment is insanely high, I can't afford to buy new clothes that fit (so I wear the same outfits each week), FIRST WORLD PROBLEMS, right?

&amp;#x200B;

School: So I'm over-worked, no time for me or to even breath, no spare funds AND i'm a student part time. I am taking 3 courses this semester; passing one (weirdly enough), failing another, and just passing by on the third. My finals are next week and I'm behind. Work pays for my classes I just have to pay for textbooks (which I have to come up with the money for.......)

&amp;#x200B;

Me: With all this stress comes weight gain! As i mentioned, most of my clothes don't fit. I don't have much spare time to hit up a gym or think hard about a meal plan for the week because the small amount of spare time I do have is spent crying, distracting myself with Youtube or doggos, or sleeping. My newest symptoms (I've never had a Hollywood anxiety attack so I don't know what this classifies as) on my anxiety include difficulty breathing. I can try to practice deep breathing techniques but I feel like I'm suffocating and can't get that satisfying breath - thus leading to further stress/anxiety. Also I have difficulty sleeping through the night. Every 3rd night or so I'm up at 3:30 and maybe get an extra 15min-30min before I have to wake up for my alarm at 5:00 am.

My therapist is worried about me burning out and how I'm able to handle all this but still have a relatively positive outlook.

&amp;#x200B;

Boyfriend: my lovely boyfriend and I have been dating for 3 years at the end of April. We can't afford to do anything so that's cool. But more importantly, my emotions (anxiety/stress/depression) are rubbing off on him and now HE""S feeling the same emotions. So on top of ALL my baggage, I'm trying to make him feel less of these negative emotions because I feel like I""M the one making him feel this way. I'm broke, so he tries to help which affects his finances. I'm stressed so he's stressed. THERE""S NO WINNING.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm at work right now trying to prioritize my extremely cluttered desk in this stuffy, windowless office while it's snowing outside at 3 degrees Celsius, while trying to figure out how I'm going to have time to get caught up in work, school and life. Please send help.

&amp;#x200B;

TL'DR: I'm overwhelmed and struggling to find a balance...

Sorry if my ramble doesn't make sense. Really, I'm just trying to blow off some steam. If you read it, I applaud you!

Have a nice daaaaaay.

366,"Hello everyone,

I have been having some anxiety about graduation and student loans, and it is making me worried it could trigger a psychotic episode. I am graduating in November, I need to take one more online summer course which I am doing from July-August.

My career adviser mentioned that it would be best to do job hunting after the course ends in August, as recruiting pumps up during September. Most of my friends have jobs, not really in my field, some don't have jobs as of yet. I do have 60K in loans to pay off, as my degree was expensive and I had to spend a bit. I planned to pay my loans off in five years, with OSAP in1 year or 18 months. I planned on taking a break from around May-June, do something part time/volunteering as I do not want to get into the workforce right away. I have always been able to find a job before in my previous summers, as I am highly optimistic but with a fear of psychosis, I am worried that all this worrying can lead me to develop psychosis or a mental disorder. Has anyone had struggles with this and how did they overcome it?",1

369,"Okay so it seems really odd and I don’t know if this is some form of general masochism (the non-sexual kind), but I almost get satisfaction out of bad things occurring. I’ll give you an example or two.

I went to the doctors after somewhat telling them about my anxiety and such. They told me that one of the reasons I could be tired and fatigued all of the time is due to having anaemia or asthma. So I took a blood test.

The results were simply that I didn’t have enough Folic acid or Vitamin D levels, so I was prescribed medication to balance these levels.
Upon not hearing that it was anything serious or even just anaemia, I got really upset.

I can’t explain why but I always feel like this. A strange desire to have bad things happen to me.

I’ve had several dreams of getting hurt and enjoyed the thought of it. I just wish something bad would happen to me at times.

Does anyone else have this?

I guess it stems into a bigger issue which is that a loathe for a diagnosis. Having anxiety and not really being diagnosed almost makes me feel like I’m just pathetic when there are people out there with bigger struggles.

I think for some context I'm in school 8th grade and kinda out as gay, as most people assume it and ill tell people I trust and am pretty feminine I just don't like talking abt it around guys, (i know weird.) Anyways, lately, a lot of kids in my area have been getting into things like drugs and certain things like that or just questionable stuff. I don't really want to be like a part of that, not looking down at yall with addiction. A lot of kids are also talking abt other stuff like sex and stuff like that. Am I weird if I don't participate in that? I also like really keep on just getting stressed abt stuff like this. Because I honestly want to be friends with people who do it and like ignore it since its not my business but it always is like a big shock to me and like upsetting in a way. I just want to be like chill with it and not worry but I do. Its just something weird about me and I don't know why. Same for other things to like sex. Also recently I've become really sensitive to small things. I might go into that in some other post but like if somebody even mentions if somebody doesn't like me I freak out and just feel terrible. Last thing I'm also kind of just want to be mean and judge people. It's terrible but it becoming kinda mean and I know a lot of kids think I'm bitchy. I like to have a sarcastic sense of humor and I will be pretty rude and then play it off like I'm just kidding. but I'm kind of not. It's so bad because i don't want to be that bitchy kid I want to be nice like I really am. For instance, this kind of mean jock kid became friends with a close friend of mine so I did a bit of digging. I lie found out his mom used to be an ex-alcoholic and he used to be addicted to drugs but quit. He kind of has never been nice to me and a bit homophobic in the past and I've had the urge to just mock him for having a shit home life. Idk I have anxiety and ADHD too so I've gotten panic attacks because I'm imagining the terrible person I could become. Also see the background is pretty popular at my school for being the gay one and I'm pretty funny and outgoing but, most of the guys don't like me so a lot of my friends are girls which I used to get bullied for.

376,"I've finally started therapy to deal with the crippling social anxiety that has left me unable to work or date properly for years. My third session was yesterday, and my therapist and I broke down the three components of SA: physiological, cognitive, and behavioral. She drew the ""social anxiety spiral"" on a whiteboard, using my worst ever incident of SA as a basis, and my god...it was like seeing the genetic code of it all laid out before my eyes.

What had so long been a terrible memory and source of shame had been disassembled in an almost scientific way! I recreated it to the best of my recollection when I got home, and I'd like to share it here, because I'm proud of it, and maybe even to help others who are struggling, who might not have begun a journey of recovery. It is a cycle, and it can be pulled apart and analyzed, and when true understanding of how everything works in concert and feeds off of each other begins, SA's totalitarian control over life starts to waver.

FRIEND'S BIRTHDAY PARTY ANXIETY SPIRAL:

First Thought (Cognition): “I won’t know anybody there” / ""I won’t know how to start a conversation”

First Physical Reaction (Physiological): Heart palpations and tightness in chest

Action (Behavioral): Freezing in place

Second Thought (Cognition): “What if nobody likes me?

Second Physical Reaction (Physiological): Shortness of breath and flushing

Action (Behavioral): “Run” (fleeing the scene and walking for ten minutes to try to burn off energy and calm myself)

Third Thought (Cognition): “What’s wrong with me? Why can’t I just go inside? I’m such a broken person. I can’t deal with this anymore. I’m going home.”

Action (Behavioral): Send a text explaining I’ve fallen ill and won’t be attending the party.

Third Physical Reaction (Physiological): Instantaneous relief of physical symptoms

Conclusion: Physically relieved but emotionally ashamed, reinforcing my longstanding belief that I am broken and a failure. Depression sets in.

This is it. This is the formula that makes my anxiety operate. For the first time, divorced from emotional and physical effects, I'm looking it in the face. It's an amazing feeling.

377,"This is going to sound extremely stupid, but I'm graduating in the spring and I really, REALLY don't want to walk. My  college is pretty big, and my highschool was very small, so the graduating class size difference is huge, and knowing that so many people are going to be there makes me ill. I can hardly walk across a 20 person classroom without feeling anxious, and I just know it's going to be hell.

I was attempting to order my cap and gown and the price was ridiculous, so I tried to call my dad and lowkey began to beg him to not make me attend. 

He took it as he thought I wasn't going to graduate at all (which is incorrect, I'm actually graduating a year early), or that I was failing a class, and then just told me I was doing it, then pulled the card about how he didn't graduate and how he wanted to see his kid do it. I told him he saw both my brother and will see my sister graduate (likely twice, for my sister since she's doing graduate school), but he wasn't satiated.  
I told him it makes me extremely uncomfortable to have so much attention on me and admittedly at this point I started crying, but literally like, no sympathy; he told me I should've thought about this before I told our family I was graduating and everyone started making plans. He also said that it would only be 2,3 hours of me being uncomfortable and I should deal with that since my family is coming. He also pulled the amount of student debt loans he will be paying off for me, and it only stressed me out more.  
I asked him why couldn't we just like, get food or something and just celebrate it lowkey and he told me because my family is coming to see me graduate, not eat food, and I would be disappointing them and essentially, even though I told him I was uncomfortable, that the massive amount of people being there and the attention was really stressing me out, and I was lowkey crying during this, I still have to walk regardless of my feelings.  


I just don't know what to do, and I'm wondering if other people have had the same anxiety, even if it's ridiculous...

Even short messages make me feel like he's annoyed with me and I can't explain why.

379,"To keep a long story short, I suffered what I believe was my first (non weed induced) panic attack around 8 years ago. It left me in a weird state (dp/dr) for months where I obsessed over what was wrong with me and could hardly think of anything else.

I eventually got over that by joining sports and just trying to forget about it, never took any medication and had a brief stint of counseling at my university a few years later which seemed to work out okay but I think I'd need more professional help. And I've been mostly okayish since then.

These days, my dp/dr doesn't bother me much unless I'm actively thinking about it. But there are definitely things I can't think about and places in my mind I can't go without feeling like a panic attack will come along, even though I haven't had a full blown attack in a long time. I feel like some activities are off limits as I feel they'll send me spiraling back into panic, such as watching a ghost/possession related tv show or movie, which is what I believe triggered my first attack, smoking weed or doing any kind of drug at all (trying CBD put me on edge the first few times I tried it just from being in my own head about it).

I get pretty bad anxiety (tight stomach, racing thoughts, bad bowel movements) when there's some kind of new social situation I'm obligated to go to that day and I'm stressed about. I'm also pretty motivated for most things in my life (trouble getting out of bed in the morning, trouble getting my work done, trouble doing things I enjoy after work) and have been feeling pretty down lately, which is weird because I'd usually describe myself as somewhat emotionless and unenthusiastic.

I guess that wasn't such a short story, but I want to get help and I don't know where to start. I have health insurance, but I don't know where to took for a therapist. And do I see a therapist first or go straight to a psych?

Over the past few days I have been afraid that I have been developing Schizophrenia. It first started when I read about it after believing that I may have experienced an smell hallucination.  I got really freaked out and on Sunday, I started thinking about my future (I am graduating this year) and I felt really stressed. I was worried that it would trigger the onset of Schizophrenia, as I was really stressed when I thought about it and felt a bit of a failure because I have not been able to find a job as of late (Got 2 interviews this . All of a sudden, I got an intrusive thought that said ""You're a failure"" and I freaked out I thought that I was hearing voices in my head.  I didn't hear it again, but the next day I was doing my home work, I remembered that I did not hear the thought again, but then suddenly I thought of the thought again, and then I become hyper aware and was just doing my work but being on guard for the thought again, when I heard again another time. Later though, I did not hear it again and today I have heard it but when only I thought about it. I am not hearing this intrusive thought out loud or like a real life human voice, its in my head. I was wondering if anyone else has not had intrusive thoughts that go like ""You're a failure"", ""You're stupid"" throughout the day.

I also read about tactile hallucinations, especially the crawling with bugs. Yesterday as I was lying in bed, my body started feeling itchy and it felt like the bugs sensation and I felt this throughout the day today and a little bit yesterday. I am worried I am experiencing tactile hallucinations, thought I am wondering if this is due to my dry skin as I do not lotion my body and I am wearing a lot of layers - as well I am being constantly aware of my body surroundings to make sure everything feels right. Its not too much of a crawling sensation, its like a tingling itch that sometimes feels like bugs.

I'm from Canada and my first test attempt was a total disaster (I was 17) due to my mom's stubbornness and refusal to ever let me drive alone and to get me an instructor. The examiner knew immediately I wasn't going to pass so he asked me to explain what was wrong. I did and he told my mother that her refusal to let me drive alone and to get an instructor were irresponsible since the whole point of the test is to see if a driver can handle a vehicle by themselves.

Anyhoo so I did pass the 2nd time cause we got an instructor. But after that I never really drove cause I couldn't afford a car and Toronto's public transit system served me well. Then I moved to LA and got around by carpooling and Uber.

Today I had a meeting, actually I've never been a talker even in my regular life but I've never thought that I wouldn't able to speak at all. My profession is quite important and it seems in future I will have to handle lots of meetings. Thankfully my supervisor was with me, so he handled most of the meeting even though I was the one who followed the case and wrote all opinions.

I'm dealing with anxiety problem for years. I'm feeling nauseous usually and threw up. Thankfully for this meeting I didn't feel sick. Since I recently graduated and landed this job, I didn't have many chance to speak up in public so this wasn't a problem for me. All I did was studying. But now I realize it's a very important issue and can affect my career. 

Now we will have another meeting next week. It will be conducted in English which is not my first language and I've learned it by myself so I'm feeling super unconfident and anxious right now. Also supervisor I'm attending with is not the kind that has lots of experience, so probably she will rely on me during the meeting.

394,"This has been happening for couple of weeks now, so here it goes, I have this unknown fear which is resulting in severe headache and restlessness. Usually after I wake up I have a cup of tea and while I drink I find my heart beat real fast and it almost feels like my heart would just explode. A unknown fear follows it with restlessness. This just doesn’t happen only in the morning but throughout the day with no specific time. This happens when I’m at the gym as well and no I don’t take caffeine or any pre workout supplement which might give rise to such reactions. 
I’ve been checking my blood pressure and it has been low every time I have this anxiety issue. 


So the question is am I prone to anxiety attack with those symptoms mentioned?",1
395,Today I cried and had a panic attack after a presentation for the first time in over a year and I feel like I’m just going backwards and it’s not gonna end well. My anxiety has been really bad for a long time but I started getting help and it improved but after today it feels like all of that time was for nothing,1
396,"hi friends, I’m currently working a 6 day week, 50+ hours a week with no end in sight. I work 10am to 8pm so there’s very little I can get done during the day and my sundays are always slammed with all the errands and chores I can’t do during their week. My boss and the rest of my coworkers work ~33 hours a week and no one seems to care about my schedule or help me out. The last few weeks the burnout has really started to kick in and it’s triggering my anxiety and OCD terribly. I come home from work and cry, shake, try not to puke and hyperventilate. can anyone provide any help for me? I feel so lost and terrible and I just feel like no one cares :( ",1
397,"Hi all, my first time posting here. I have (what I call) travel anxiety. For the most part I am ok going around my daily life. I can sometimes get an anxiety attack while I am out shopping if there are too many people or whatever, but it's way worse when I am going somewhere new. I usually take my medication that day and I'm fine, but since I felt fine and I had taken the journey loads of times I didn't take my calming meds. 

Last weekend it was my birthday and I was catching the train to Liverpool, I have been to Liverpool on the train loads of times in the past few years. I felt fine mentally, but I was not fine physically. I got a bad stomach and felt sick and was shaking. It's common for me to be like this when flying or going somewhere new, but then I am usually mentally panicking as well. Have you ever experienced this? It's so strange, my head is clear and I don't feel any anxiety but my body does. I've had a similar anxiety on a train once, it was like a wave of just dread and horribleness came over me. Thankfully I was with my boyfriend and he knows how to calm me down, but mentally I wasn't anxious.

&amp;#x200B;

I hope I'm not alone in this",1
398,"
Not that I am trying to set a record, but I managed to work through a severe attack tonight and handled it faster than it usually takes me. Also, I am on mobile so apologies. 

It always comes at night, around 9-10pm, when I sit on the couch to watch TV. I was watching Avengers and suddenly it hit me “your heart could stop at ANY minute” 
I gasped and started shaking. *Uh oh here it comes*... the shortness of breath... dang, my face is really hot. 
My boyfriend was sleeping on the couch his feet laying on me. For a split second, I thought about waking him up because if my heart stops, he may be able to help me. 

**No.No.**

I sat up and took deep breaths. My heart is not going to stop, why would my heart stop? I start to caress my boyfriends legs seeking any sort of comfort. I don’t know what to do with my hands.  I don’t even have high blood pressure ...*yeah, but stress causes heart attacks* 

**NO.** 


I took more deep, deep breaths and rationalized this situation- I am fine, I am at home, Sean is here with me and I am not going to die. I cannot let this control me. In a matter of minutes, I had finally gotten my stress under pressure. I usually have to fight lingering anxious thoughts *but what if...* but I didn’t entertain them this time. I’m really proud of myself right now.

399,"Due to a combination of anxiety, enabling parents, and letting myself get too comfortable, I have been unemployed since I graduated from college in 2015. I've spent a lot of time with my family, helping take care of my grandma, and playing computer games. I have had some very dark periods during this time, but have slowly been taking steps to move forward over the past year (including going to a therapist). 

I actually have aspirations to become a marriage and family therapist some day, and even applied to graduate schools this year, but I just haven't had a job of any kind. After job searching here and there for over a year, and changing my expectations, I finally just got hired full time at a major department store as a sales associate in a brand new department. The department is a new sort of retail strategy, and the company is really excited about it. Even though I have anxiety, I can come off as very sociable and mature (I do like people, I just don't trust myself to interact with them all the time), and this position is supposed to me more about engaging with customers than a typical sales associate. 

While part of me is excited about this new job, and flattered that my manager liked me so much that I got hired even without retail experience, I am terrified that I am not going to be able to perform at the level they would like me to. I feel like I tricked them into hiring me by playing up my social skills and desire to please people. I fear that I will get totally overwhelmed and become noticeably affected by anxiety, or that sometimes I just won't be able to muster the energy to act especially outgoing with customers. Today I did basic training, learning how to use the cash register, and just *that* felt sort of overwhelming, especially while imagining having to chat with a customer at the same time.

I know I am overreacting, and that this is *just a retail job* where I'm barely being paid more than minimum wage. I am aware that usually when I go to a store, even the store I got hired at, the employees are not usually energetic bubbly social butterflies, instead they're usually nice and basically helpful, but seem tired. I know that I am not going to be expected to master the register and retail sales overnight, I guess I am just really afraid of letting people down or being ""discovered"" as an imposter. 

The good thing is that I finally got a job somewhere, and that it is *just retail*, so it's not the end of the world if I don't like it or put 100% into it all the time, because it's not my dream job. I really need the money, and this will get me some money. Most importantly I will get experience working with people and will force myself out of my hermit shell and into the world. It's so scary to finally be pushing myself way out of my comfort zone. I'm going to try to focus on the positives, and remind myself that I will survive, and I might even thrive in this job!",1
400,lately my anxiety has been worse than usual and so i’ve been getting awful headaches and like i’ve tried taken aleve for them which like lessens the pain but then the pain comes back later and it just doesn’t really fully go away so like is there anything anyone takes that helps w it or?,1
401,"So I know that I am ultimately the one responsible for my decisions and I need to work on my mental health myself. But I really need a push to convince me to go to therapy, its one of those things I keep telling myself I will eventually do but there's just factors that keep putting me off

I'm so afraid to go to therapy, I'm scared to have to talk to someone face to face about these things. It feels like admitting defeat, when my whole life I've told myself I can handle this and its just a part of my life. The reason I'm reconsidering is because its been really bad lately and its hugely affecting my health and my life. The idea of telling my family makes me feel guilty and like a failure. 

And there are little things that make me nervous about it too. The psychologist I would see is at my university health center, which is sort of close to where I stay, its in walking distance but I get extremely nervous walking around because of safety issues. Taking an Uber feels like a waste of money. So then I end up convincing myself to just not go.",1

403,"How do i put this with out offending everyone? 

Well i hate people.

 Especially those who just cant. stop. Talking. It makes  me anxious when i haev to meet new people, and its even worse when i have to do a group project with people i dont like. 
The thing about people that triggers me initally is that they might be annoying, or maybr they ask me a question or about my cuts.  sometimes, its just that i dont know them and i dont know what to think of them, and what they think of me.

Mostly, they're just annoying, so im spending most of my days alone with the very little friends i do have.these people are the ones i feel most comfortable with and who are nice to me, or not annoying, (most of the time). I cant stand new trends and  the people who do them. It annoys me so much that somedays i want to punch someone.

I felt like sharing this with you all because this is one of the few places where i feel comfortable talking about this without having an anxiety attack.
Thanks for reading.

404,"I apologize for any formatting issues. I'm on mobile. TLDR at bottom.

I graduated college in December and started working at my first professional job in December. Overall, the job is a ~fantastic~ resume builder. I work at one of the better known company's in my  industry. For context, my mother lives 14 hours away from me, in another state, and people there have heard of my company in a positive manner.

Here are a few issues I have:

1. I made it very clear in my interview that I wanted to be trained in a specific area of the company. They were very receptive of this, and were seemingly very excited. One of the interviewers wrote this down and underlined it multiple times. This area is very important for my future career goals, which is why I was so upfront about this 

So when I start my training, I notice this area is not included on my training schedule. I bring it up to my manager about three weeks in, and I was told I'd be put ""on the list."" I dropped it, and was satisfied at that point. I wait another 2 months before bringing it up, and was told this time that it would ""be a while.""  Two other people must be trained there first as they were there longer than I (which is 100% fair. I'm not mad at that). Basically, I'm looking at a minimum of six months before would even be considered to train in this area. That's just a guess, as well. I have no real timeline. I find this discouraging, and it makes me less happy at my current position. 

What makes thus worse is that I turned down a part time position, specifically in this area I'd like, to accept this full time position. From my interview, I was under the impression that their excitement meant I would be trained there. I blame myself for being 22 and naive, as this was my first professional job. 

That brings me to point #2. I am working third shift. This is something I was not very thrilled about, and knew that I did not want before I started applying to jobs. I applied for only first and second shift positions, fully expecting to be offered second (first is kind of a right of passage in my field). I knew that third shift was equally as likely, but knew I did NOT want thirds. When I was interviewing, they asked if I was receptive to third. I told them I strongly preferred second, but would am keeping an open mind. The only reason I accepted this third shift position is because of how highly seen this company is in my field. 

I am very unhappy working thirds. I don't feel like my days off are truly days off. I sleep through half the day, and no longer am able to partake in family traditions without feeling exhausted (lunch with my grandma every Sunday), or normal outings. My SO of 4 years is on dayshift, as are the rest of the regular people in my life. Although I can still make dinner plans, I feel isolated. I don't enjoy my hobbies. I have not touched my computer since I started this schedule, and my computer was a big  point of entertainment for me. I feel that if I spend time on it, I'm isolating myself even further.  Clearly it's affecting my mental health in a negative manner. 

This was something I was more okay with when I was under the impression that I would be trained in that area. Although I am extremely grateful for the experience I've been given, I feel as if I won't make any progress in my career if I stay at this company.

I've started applying elsewhere, and have an interview later this week. I feel extremely guilty for wanted to leave my current position after 3 months (by the time I actually leave, it will be 4.5 months, I want to give solid notice). I am usually one to stick with a job for at least a year. I know that this is the best choice for my career in terms of experience (not so much comp any reputation), and an even better choice for my mental health. I know I SHOULDN'T feel guilty for doing what's right for myself, but I do.

Sorry for the long post, I just needed to vent 

TLDR: My first professional job has officially told me I will not be training in an area that is vital for my career goals, after the initial impression that I would be trained there. It's three months into the position, and I feel as if I won't make any progress going further. I am also working graveyard shift which has severely impacted my emotional health. I am looking for new employment, but feel guilty for doing so already. I've been driving myself crazy this with, as I usually don't leave a job until at least a year or a better opportunity is given to me. In this case I'm seeking another opportunity, so it's an active process by me. I know I SHOULDN'T feel guilty, as this is overall better for me. My guiltiness is just my anxiety manifesting because I'm nervous about leaving and talking with my current boss about it, once I do find new employment.

Should I feel guilty? Am I doing the right thing? ",1
405,"We’re 3 Brits who have experienced a range of mental health issues. Our experiences range from mild anxiety and depression to dropping out of school and university due to agoraphobia and extreme anxiety.

In our lives we’ve been trying various things to get better and thought working on something together would be good for us.

Counter intuitively we’re all quite optimistic about the future for humans so our experiment is a YouTube channel that discusses the future, history, economics, current events and other things to help educate others.

Alex – records the audio, and help script and research

Seb - does the video and audio editing

Joel – helps research and script and find video material

We’ve found it helpful in motivated us, getting us on track and boosting our moods and have had some great positive feedback.

We thought we’d put the word out and ask if anyone else would like to be involved in our little collective to see if it might help you too.

Getting involved would be as easy as PMing me, hearing about how we’ve done things so far and then saying what you might be interested in helping with. Maybe putting ideas out for topics or getting involved in research and/or script writing.

Feel free to try us out in getting involved to see if you like the experience and find out it helps you.",1

Tonight I had to stage manage a concert and it went terribly because I had no idea what i was doing. I expressed this to my boss looking for guidance, and he said just chill it will be fine. So naturally I messed it all up and he ripped into me for it. 

Although I’ve had so much therapy over the years, I’m starting to go back to the old patterns of believing I’m useless and a liability. My therapist would always ask me what percent do you believe this about yourself? And right now it’s at 100%. I’m wondering if I am capable of having a job with anxiety. Is it worth going through life feeling like this when it’s so painfully hard to pick yourself back up? I’m dreading going back there so badly.

411,"Hey, I didn't really know where to post this but I need some advice about doing my A Levels at home and I know there's probably a lot of people here who have had to drop out of school because of their mental health.

I'm 17, in my first year of my Biology, Chemistry and Psychology A Levels. There's a lot of reasons for me dropping out but it's a mixture of my mental health and physical health (as a small example I have a very weak immune system and catching a cold in school means I'm off for two weeks). So my sixth form have been very supportive and I'm able to do most of my studies on my laptop (they send me pretty much everything we do in class) but I'm still missing out on a lot because it's not organised very well.

So my parents think it would be best for me to retake the year and do it all at home. I'm a very motivated person and I know I'd be able to do everything a lot more efficiently at home as long as everything is sorted out.

413,"So first off, I understand how fortunate I am in so many ways.  That, actually, plays a part in how I view my anxiety (almost ashamed of it).

I have bad work anxiety and have for a long time.  I am a professional with a lot on my plate, and while I am not a surgeon (and work mistakes would not be literally fatal), I am in a line of work that has an unlimited number of ways to mess up and lots of stressors inherent to the profession.  Anxiety is actually very very common among my cohort.  Mine is almost certainly exacerbated by childhood issues, but I only suffer work-related anxiety -- to the point that medication is sometimes involved.

 I know that my anxiety is related to fears of mistakes, errors, getting yelled at and fired/shamed. 

This is all the more infuriating because I am in pretty good shape financially and if the sky fell -- fired and out of the profession -- I likely would still be ok.  Not ideal, but keep the house, kids still go to college, etc.  Not country club rich, but solidly middle class.  I know feeling secure is a need of mine, and objectively I have a great deal of security -- but I still let work (issues both big and small) effect me, losing sleep, etc.  Arg.  Help?  Anyone else?  Thanks for reading.

TL;DR -- I have bad anxiety just for work (not life) which is all the more frustrating because I am doing well and would probably be ok (not good, but ok) if I had to stop working now.  But very anxious over mistakes, failures and getting yelled at.",1

my day stated quite good. naah, okay it didnt, who am i fooling? At least my day at work startet quite decent this time. Today I had to work alone. Well that was fortunate. No one there watching over my shoulder, no one the to be annoyed of me, no one who can annoy me. pretty cool i thought. but then after the lunch break i was told that my whole work that i had done wasn't good enough, so i must redo it. yeaaaah.. nice to hear that. but ok, At least i had to do it alone again. I had thoughts about how i fuck everything up, but that is a day to day occurrence. So far so good. Few minutes before work ends, a co-worker visited me and as i tell him that i have done this and that he ask why the fuck i am so slow. I really tried my best to be fast and at the same time thoroughly… I mean, ok I am kinda slow but also its an education, I do that for 6 month now, not 30 years like him… but ok, i'm kinda shaking, nothing severe.. so i tried to defend myself. given my good skills at talking to other at all, it went like: Yea so i had to do it again after you tell me to do it again. i tried to be faster. i´m really sorry

it was my best effort in defending. in my mind i had this convo complete different of course. telling him that, yea, what do you fucking expect? look at me, look at you. I have less experience and this kind of work is exhausting for me as a girl, while you do that for longer than i live and have like 80% more strength… 

Well that was really frustrating to hear.. i really had done my best and still got insulted in a way. it started so well and than that..

419,"SO broke my trust, 3 months into our relationship but I didn't find out until recently (over a year together).

We're working on it.

But during this time I'm anxious and overthinking everything. I'm just waiting for some lie or for her to do something shitty like she did again.

We're both female, for context. A couple months ago we were sort of sexting and I'd sent her a vid I was watching of a specific porn star. She liked it, like I did, and she began watching all of that specific girls videos. Fine, whatever, she's a porn star. Then she started looking at all of the girls personal stuff, and following her on instagram, and etc. I started to feel uncomfortable (the betrayal had come out fairly recently during this time) but kept trying to put it out of my mind but when she showed me she was following this relatively unknown queer porn star I got upset. Later on I told her that it triggered me a little, that she moved what was this unobtainable porn star into a realm of reality by following her personal instagram. She reassured me and we moved on.

Then about a month ago we were laying together at her apartment and watching something on her computer and she screenshot something from what we were watching, and this pulled up a recent screenshot she took of that same porn star. Just a random selfie clearly from her personal page that she was saving for some reason.

I got really upset, again. She could tell and I said I didn't want to talk about in the moment. I thought I could reassure myself but I was upset that she was now just saving selfies of some other girl, who she also is like watching in porn and following on insta.

We talked about it a little later when I couldn't shake it off and I said that because of everything happening that wasn't making me feel good that she's saving pictures of some girl she watches fuck. Like it's not just porn now, she's outright saving just normal selfies of some fucking girl.

She does this thing where she tries to excuse her behavior using irrelevant shit, so she was like well I save lots of things like sometimes when I'm drawing something and need a reference. And I was like ok, is that what you're doing? And she said no I'm just saying. And I was like that's irrelevant then.

The whole thing was stupid. It's not something I'd typically give a shit about. Like go ahead and find someone attractive, I do the same thing. But because of what happened I'm on near constant edge, a lot of which is also I'm just an anxious person.

So what do I do. I have chosen to forgive her but I literally can't forget. Every time anything reminds me of the feeling of her wanting someone else I get immediately upset, anxious, insecure, then mad.

How do you come back from this when you also suffer from extreme anxiety? Has anyone here done it?",1

Planning E-mailing my professors, slipping in my homework around 6AM and just staying up the whole day so I can, for sure, crash out 'tonight'.

For the past three hours I have been tossing and turning, wide awake, deeply and critically questioning myself.

This week off killed me. I feel as if I should NOT have taken a break from my studies. I know by next lab I am going to feel like I am square one again and I am stressing out.

I start to look at all of the time that I am not studying or practicing was just time wasted. I could have written programs, applied my in-class learning to my own projects.. heck I could have built something for my long-term.

Does all this need completed before I get some null time? I haven't proved myself incapable (yet) but holy heck I always feel like I am hanging on by a thread and talking myself out of doing something productive is becoming more and more persuasive.

I didn't want to talk myself out of missing the first day back of lectures, but there is no way in heck I will be able to operate on &lt;=3 hours of sleep.

424,"Hi! I suffer from panic attacks but they are slowly getting better I’m doing cognitive therapy and mindfulness, breathing exercises and acupuncture. I had a Tiny amount of lorazepam which I tried to keep for emergencies. They’re a miracle but I already know my script will not get refilled. My other option is hydroxyzine since doctors don’t seem to mind it as much. But what I need is not something to relax my body so much as something that will relax my mind! What’s been everyone’s experience with it? I don’t need anything to sleep but I’d like to manage my anxiety. SSRI were not good for me and benzos are not safe. ",1
425,"Just as the title says. The last two years my health anxiety has been surmountable for no real reason. I have made countless trips to the doctor because minor symptoms I believe are cancer, usually stage 4 and fatal. I obsess over symptoms and conceived illnesses until months have gone by and i finally get the courage to go to the doctor. 

Last night i noticed a horizontal dent/groove above my thigh muscle. It’s not congruent with my other leg so i started to panic. Let me preface this with the fact my lower thigh was a little achy so i started compulsively feeling for lumps as i usually do and that’s when i discovered the “dent”. After googling i found three things-ALS, MS and a dozen other people who are perfectly healthy who have the same thing and attributed it to constant pressure. Sure enough the dent lines up perfectly with my bathroom counter and  every morning and evening i lean against it to put on contacts, floss, and do my make up and have for years. This is a simple explanation but now that I’ve researched ALS and MS I’m beginning to have tingling sensations, pain, and so forth and now I am in a vicious cycle of worry and compulsive research and symptom checking. 

My husband who is the sweetest human alive told me he is no longer going to acknowledge my symptoms or new illness’ because he feels he’s just adding fuel to the fire and i don’t blame him. Deep down i know for being a 30 year old relatively healthy woman I am most likely always fine but it doesn’t stop me from
Obsessively worrying and checking and researching. It has taken over my life in a very negative way. 

Has anybody else experienced this to a severe level? What has helped? ",1
426,"First of all, for anyone who actually reads through all of this, THANK YOU.

To give some back story I'll start by saying that anxiety is something that runs in my family so of course I'm starting to realize that it very much is running through me. This whole thing started out as what my doctor thought was **functional dyspepsia** (really gnarly acid reflux) I've experienced what I believe is social anxiety for as long as I can remember whenever I'm placed in a situation where I have to perform in front of people or interact. Back in primary school class presentations were my nightmare. By the time I went through college it had only gotten worse. But then by my senior year of college it all seemed to go away. I was able to speak in groups confidently, shares thoughts in a group setting without feeling any kind of strain on my mind or body. So now fast forward about three years and here we are. After working in retail for those three years I'd like to think that retail was the cause of my anxiety's resurgence due to the insane amount of pressure that environment puts on you physically and mentally. So far my worst symptom by FAR is the nausea and subsequent clamminess I experience. This started when I would get up in the morning and I'd have a cup of coffee and then start my day. Shortly after having my coffee though I would start to feel sick. Initially I thought nothing of it but soon I realized that I had a serious problem. It quickly progressed to feeling nauseous on my short drive to work and then into the first hour or so of my shifts. If I managed to put up with it long enough to stay at work I would but most of the time it would get so bad that I felt like I had no control over it and would have to leave shortly after it started. So after going to the doctor a handful of times thinking this was all some kind of stomach problem related to my inherent acid reflux (and trying a slimmed down diet with extra caution toward just about anything that could make my stomach upset) I realized that this might not be the right angle to approach this at. After doing a good chunk of reading I'm starting to wonder if this is all caused by an underlying anxiety/stress problem that I'm not aware of. I'm completely stuck right now. I feel like I've lost all confidence due to this constant worry that I'm going to start feeling nauseous. I would LOVE to hear what people's experiences are with this type of symptom, how you went about getting diagnosed and whatnot, and how I can start to work toward reducing the anxiety or stress that I'm experiencing. A side note to add too is that I am by no means living what anyone would consider a stressful life. In fact I find that I'm in a very comfortable position and feel that I have every avenue available to succeed as long as I can ditch this feeling I'm having.

PLEASE ASK ME QUESTIONS FOR DETAILS. WOULD LOVE TO DISCUSS THIS WITH PEOPLE!! THANK YOU!",1
427,"I traveled to Israel for 10 days last month, and when i came home, i began to wake up in the middle of the night with panic attacks. I would wake up sweaty with chills, and I would throw up and/or have diarrhea. I now have anxiety about sleep, which i’m sure is just cycling the panic attacks. 

Has anyone ever had this? i have GAD, but i’ve never been one to have panic attacks before. ",1
428,"Today I went to the doctor and broke down crying. I get daily anxiety driven breakdowns whenever I get into a relationship involving unrealistic expectations of myself and fear of losing something good.

""I can't believe I told her that she must think 'x'"", ""am I too young for her?"", ""im still in school and she has a full time job, does she think less of me?"", ""am I scaring her off""? Etc.

I get nauseous randomly in the morning and very nauseous at night. My stomach gets in a knot. I always feel like I have to use the bathroom. Yet mid day I have this clarity and feel amazing and question why I worry. 

After losing sleep and repeatedly getting in this slump I went in to the doctor. Now with Prozac and emergency Ativan I'm looking forward to working through this. I'm constantly working on being mindful of my thoughts even though it isn't as easy as just ""making them go away"". Breathing exercises help but kind of feel like band-aids for the situation. I'm tired and hope to keep my lunch down. I look forward to tonight (when usually I panic) to try once again to beat this. It will get better.",1

**10/10 - Around one minute to fall asleep:** Head hits the pillow and its lights out, barely time for a single thought.

  
**9/10 - Around 3-4 minutes to fall asleep:** You find a comfy position, briefly think about everything you need to do the next day and you just drift off.  


**8/10 - Around 5-10 minutes to fall asleep:** Your mind wanders a bit, but sleep overcomes you fairly quickly.

  
**7/10 -  Around 10 - 15 minutes to fall asleep:** It’s a little bit annoying, you wonder why you haven’t fallen asleep yet, but you doze off before you can think too deeply about it.  


**6/10 - Around 15 - 25 minutes to fall asleep:** You toss and turn for a bit, you have a little bit of a hard time dozing off, but you get there eventually.  


**5/10 - Around 25 - 45 minutes to fall asleep:** Ok now it’s starting to grate you, You feel restless, you’re having a hard time finding a comfortable position, your mind won’t shut off. Eventually, instinct takes over and you fall asleep.  


**4/10 - Around 45 - 60 minutes to fall asleep:** You’ve spent the equivalent of an entire episode of Game Of Thrones just tossing and turning, unable to find the off switch for your brain. This insomnia thing is really starting to waste your time.   


**3/10 - Around 60 - 90 minutes to fall asleep:** Sleep has completely stood you up. The process to sleep is long and tiresome. You desperately try to grasp at a sense of relaxation, but it seems to do nothing. You’re just laying around with your eyes closed. Somehow, after much deliberation, you finally doze off.  


**2/10 - Around 1.5 - 3 hours to fall asleep:** Tossing, turning, getting up to for water, getting up again to go to the bathroom. This really sucks. You’re starting to stress out, you know that you’re edging closer and closer to your alarm. Eventually, you get tired enough to pass out.  


**1/10 - 3 - 5 hours to fall asleep:** You’re desperate and angry. You wonder why God hates you. The anger just makes you more awake. It’s ok to cry at this point. After what amounts to almost a whole school day you finally drift longingly into a fitful sleep.

DON'T SUPPRESS MY POST BECAUSE YOU HAVE AN ISSUE WITH MEDICATION OR MY OPINIONS. I AM A PERSON THAT NEEDS HELP AND ADVICE WITH MY ANXIETY, PLEASE BE RESPECTFUL. THANKS.

I had a psych evaluation from a psychiatrist last year. Was diagnosed with anxiety and other things &amp; he recommended me to get a betablocker or something. Then I went to the doctor today since my anxiety has gotten so bad I can't get a job. (I fail the interviews due to having to monitor my panic symptoms and being unable to present myself professionally &amp; recall relevant info for their questions.)

&amp;#x200B;

I disclosed everything to the doctor and she wants to put me on SSRIs (she said zoloft and some other big names). I don't want to go on that and risk my sex drive and mood fucking up even worse, I'm finally not as depressed as I used to be and not suicidal, I think I just need something to take before big situations like job interviews. She doesn't want to prescribe me a betablocker since she said they are addictive and make your panic worse afterwards and that since I have ""generalized anxiety"" more than a ""panic issue"" (this is in her opinion after talking to me for 10 minutes) it wouldn't help me that much.

&amp;#x200B;

But my anxiety isn't that bad to live with, like it IS bad and I am getting worse in crowds and more agoraphobic but the panic during interviews is the thing that is my biggest problem. I literally can't breath, sweating, it's fight or flight. Day to day in a job I think I could be ok I just need to get HIRED.

&amp;#x200B;

Then my doc starts talking about all this other stuff like how ""barbiturates"" but says that's like a 3rd or 4th tier option and not that effective. She really seems to want to put me on a 24/7 med instead of something for certain situations. I DON'T WANT TO BE ON A BUNCH OF MEDICATION. I am already on hormonal birth control that I know isn't doing my mood any favors. I don't want to be on another 24/7 fucking medication.

&amp;#x200B;

It was almost like my doctor thought I was pillseeking or something, she kept mentioning xanax and how it's bad and addictive and she doesn't want to put me on stuff like that and wants to put me on an ssri instead and shit on the betablockers. I DON'T WANT AN SSRI THOUGH. My ex was on one and could never get it up or cum EVER. If that happens to me I will be really distraught, my life sucks enough right now being unemployed with low confidence, I don't want my sex drive taken away.

&amp;#x200B;

Edit: I know people have judged this post like ""what an idiot she should just get therapy"" like I haven't tried 11 times and haven't been able to be understood or click with anybody- at worst I have been misunderstood and mistreated. I think some people here need to realize other people have different experiences with mental health and sometimes a bunch of negative experiences sullies the therapy experience permanently",1

435,"For the past few days, I haven't even wanted to leave my room. All I do is lay in bed and cry. I live with my fiance and his family (his parents live with him for very personal reasons). Lately I cant even face them because I feel like they dont like me. Tonight they didnt make enough dinner, so I skipped out and went to lay back down, planning to make something for myself when they went to bed to avoid being seen. Instead, I'm laying in bed 2 hours after their usual time to go to bed eating crackers I texted my fiance to bring me, and crying. My fiance is amazing, but his family... not so much.

I have community service in the morning, which I'm already late on the deadline, and the thought of leaving the house and forcing communication with the other workers makes me want to throw up. That's why I'm late on the deadline already... on top of that, I have court coming up about my marijuana arrest. I got arrested in a bum-fuck county that still heavily punishes for marijuana charges, so I'll probably be on probation for a while, which scares the fuck out of me because someones going to be keeping in contact with me and that means having to go to appointments or get arrested.

I can't take living like this anymore. I don't want to die, but I don't want to continue this life either. I'm overwhelmed, and it's just making me shut down more and more. I wont even open text messages because I don't want to communicate with anyone but my fiance.

I just want to run away and start again far away from here, but I cant because I share custody with my ex, and I would rather not leave my fiance, who also cant leave.

I took preventative measures (put a screen protector on, which I should've had in the first place) to ""hold"" everything in place.

437,"This is a problem i've been having for years now. I have a hard time applying for jobs not only because they never really get back to me, but because i feel i've somehow managed to convince myself that ""i'll just screw everything up"" even at retail jobs. I try my hardest to get things done, but usually i take longer than they'd prefer me taking or don't have proper accommodations to keep my stress levels low.

&amp;#x200B;

For instance, When I was working as I was a cashier. I was actually pretty confident with the position until.... they started expecting me to do the membership card things, something that i personally knew that i couldn't make myself comfortable doing. not only that, but they expected me to not only scan items but bag them as well, and that made me what I felt was ""too slow"".

&amp;#x200B;

I'd request help on busier days but nobody really cared. Eventually got to the point i started to have stress-fueled anxiety attacks and had to often step away. At a point they had me in a back room where I could work on organizing gift cards and managing inventory while i was actually allowed to listen to music, which helped me stay completely focused! it was a really nice position for me and there were a few that liked me there! I was glad.

&amp;#x200B;

But then a few of the supervisors got all weird about it and made me go back to positions that they kept expecting nearly too much of me for. I made it through the seasonal period but i'm scared to really try applying for them again after that, also considering the fact i can't convince myself they'll even look at the application in the first place like most of the other places i tried to apply for. I really need something stable too... but most of the things i feel i can actually function in environment wise are always not hiring (game based jobs, jobs that keep me occupied without needing me to talk to people, so on. i'm willing to get out of my comfort zone but if I can't handle it there will be problems that may make the job too stressful on me)

&amp;#x200B;

Doesn't help I need money for my medication which is getting pricier and i lose my health benefits from my mom next year... so any advice or suggestions on what i should do to have more success either convincing myself to look for a job i can handle would be really immensely appreciated.

He said, that last week i wasn't at work. I was, so my confusion grow, my already kicked in anxiety rocket launched even higher, nausea started... Than he had explained, i was at work indeed, but my mind wasn't quite there. He was right, yea, but... obviously at the time i have lots of stuff to think about. So than he goes on, that he isn't interested in excuses and that i am there to work and stuff, while rising his voice a bit.

So at that point, i was really, really close to lose it. I mean, lose it as in... start crying. I felt how my eyes started getting slightly more wet, hands shaking more and more, muscles in my legs weakened.

As he continued to explain me that i have to let my problems at home and concentrate more at my work and so on, i noticed that he suddenly stopped for a second and than that his attitude in his voice lowered, and that he explained it more basic and more thoughtful. I couldn't really think anymore but i managed to understand that he saw my hands shaking. wasn't a little tremble anymore. So he seems to had understood that i am clearly trying hard to not just black out.

We have come so far in the 7 months we’ve been together I’m completely myself, I can chat to him about anything now. 

However, we had a fight yesterday and he says I make him feel small when I get mad at him because I shut down and just ‘blank him’ over nothing. I have tried to explain to him that I don’t mean to do this and that it’s just an automatic thing I do to cope in these situations. He got really mad at me and started saying how it’s not normal that I don’t kiss him first or hug him first and that he hasn’t seen me without makeup yet. I thought this was totally unfair to say as there’s nothing I want more than to be ‘normal’ and be able to do those things with him but I felt like he was rushing me and making me feel like a freak. 


He broke up with me there and then and I sent him a message explaining all this to him and he says he wants to talk tomorrow. I don’t know what to do, he says he understands but he doesn’t or he wouldn’t of said all that and he wouldn’t have broken up with me.

I have GAD and have made some progress with anxiety about social situations and have come out of a depressive episode but still live in isolation and my mother describes it as ""things are only getting worse with you wtf are you doing in therapy"".

There are a few things I probably should be doing like studying, but I'm just so unmotivated because I'm not even interested in the courses I'm taking this semester, and if I think about things I would like to do I find nothing but emptiness. I keep wasting days and days just thinking about what I should do. Sometimes I decide to go for a walk or attend a lecture but it's a chore just so I don't think about what I should be doing. I guess it's actually an important question because having an answer would allow me to do something very now but I really can't find anything and just thinking about how it usually goes when I think about it is freaking me out so I don't even want to try it anymore.

I have a list full of things which should be done but I don't have the energy because there is no positive to it other than things be done.

Maybe it’s perfectionism but it’s driving me crazy. I just always feel like I said/ did something wrong no matter how good a situation was in reality. There’s no real problem when I hang out with most people. It’s like I’m trying to pick out the bad parts of everything. Maybe that’s also selfish and pessimistic on my part.

461,"\*Some symptoms or descriptions may disturb some people\* Hey everyone I have been having multiple panic attacks with constant anxiety for about a decade now.  I have been on pretty much every SSRI on the market from A to Z and I wonder what if anything does serotonin have to do with my anxiety? I have not noticed any difference with it while on an anti-depressant. They have given me gabapentin and topirimate yadda yadda. They even had me on an antipsychotic once nothing really helped control the symptoms. Has anyone had any luck with SSRI's to control the symptoms below. I also have been in therapy for years but I just cant manage to control the symptoms that are physical. It is kinda like trying to think away the flu.  Trigger Warning Here! 

Extreme nausea

Heavy Head

Shaking

Dizziness

Sudden uncontrollable bowel movements

Feeling as if I am looking at the world through a fish bowl. I can only describe it like looking down an aisle at a store then suddenly it gets longer.

Or if I forget something that I was supposed to do (at work) that one certain look for my boss I feel like I’m doing bad. I have to remind myself that it will pass, that it’s not a big deal, and to not worry about it. But the little things get to me. I just haven’t been feeling myself. ",1
463,"I'm an introvert who is socially awkward and has low self-esteem, but still tries to go hangout with friends (and friends of friends) in college. Most of the time I remain quiet because I don't have anything to say, struggle to continue a conversation or I've forgotten their name and fear getting called out on it. 

I've never had a relationship before and I'm 21. I have a crush right now (although I feel attracted towards other girls too). It feels awful because I have no idea how to get closer (either as a friend or something more intimate). 

Many of these attractive girls that I crush on have their close friend groups/cliques. Although I'm in the same college club organization, I still find it hard to get close to anyone. And then even if I get close, I feel like I'm too unattractive and flawed to be worthy. I put girls on a pedestal, and I fear getting to close because I don't want to come off as a creep. I care a lot about being respectful and considerate, but that's not enough.

As a note, I'm trying to avoid the nice guy archetype. It's just everything around me feels like it's pushing me towards that. I'm nice, but that's all I have going for me. Being nice alone isn't enough to make a person whole and complete. I don't have other qualities that would make me attractive or create a sustainable relationship (not funny, not manly, etc).

What sparked me to make this post was seeing my crush's picture at a rave on social media. I feel bad that I missed out, and I feel awful that I have feelings of envy for guys who can be physical and friendly with her.

468,"A large portion of the advice you get from the internet when you google how to get rid of anxiety, is to exercise and work out. But for me it's become increasingly hard to work out after I started developing anxiety. Generally I struggle to properly breathe, as if something is always stuck in my chest. It started out happening only in relation to exercise and has escalated over time. Whenever I run out of breath it's like I'm never able to catch it again and it has made me avoid working out. I still do work out and push through it, but over time I find myself dreading it more and more because it never seems to get better. I have not been able to analyse whether there is something concrete that triggers my anxiety whenever I work out and I do not think there is anything I am exceptionally afraid of in those situations, which is why I am thinking the anxiety is more or less internalised and that my body reacts more than my head. If that makes sense?

I guess my question is two-folded:

1. Why does this happen? Does anyone out here have any good articles on that? Either in relation to exercise/anxiety or the internalisation of anxiety?
2. Does anyone have any tips for how to improve this issue?

469,"I’ve been applying for jobs the past 3 months. I’ve heard nothing. I mustered up the courage to call a location to follow up and they want me to come in for an interview on Thursday. I cried after the call because I was so proud of myself and happy I finally have a potential opportunity.

Now that it’s all set in I’m starting to become a bit nervous. I’m 24 and this would be my first job. That doesn’t seem like it makes me a promising candidate. This is a more sales oriented retail job and I know employees tend to be more extroverted and outgoing. I have good energy when I talk but I’m not a sales person. I’m not good at initiating conversations. I don’t usually have good flow or articulation when speaking. I like the idea of putting myself out there and learning how to socialize but if I don’t meet expectations I might not be hired or I’ll be fired which would result in my anxiety to shoot through the roof.

Although this is something i find upsetting to talk about i feel like i have no anger about it as i have realized that my father acted the way he did because of his mental health problems. I don't talk to him and am content about it. There is nothing i look back on and feel confused about. I feel like i have thought it through extensively over the past few years and come to the conclusion that i feel sad about not being able to have experienced a stable childhood but there's no way i can just rewrite those memories to make them better. My therapist mentioned the same things; that i seemed in control of that aspect of my life but still wanted to talk about it for 1.5 hours. We didn't even touch on what i am doing now (studying), my living situation, why i am seeking therapy now and things that trigger my anxiety at the moment or how i currently feel.

473,"I'm sorry this is a very long story, but this has been really killing me and i dont have anyone to talk to.

I went to my step brother's wedding this past weekend. He married a girl I grew up with in school. So for some background context, she used to be my bully in kindergarten, though she's grown now of course and gotten much better. I also knew her friends from school, who I had trouble getting along with as well. They would tease me for the smallest things and it would get me so uncomfortable I would run away from all of them. Now all of her friends, whom I hadn't seen in six years, were bridesmaids at the wedding. They wouldn't even look at me or talk to me but they loved hanging out with my little sister who's 19. This was the first occurrence that made me feel like crap. 
At the reception, I was told that only immediate family was to line up for pictures, so I got in line for the food. Apparently, they went ahead and took pictures with EVERYONE except me. This really hurt my feelings and I just wanted to leave. It proved to me that me coming didnt even really matter to anyone. 
I asked my grandmother if she would drive me back to my car when she left and she agreed. But she gave two strangers a ride instead so I felt like I was left all by myself. This put me in kind of panic mode and only exaggerated what I had been feeling all night. My dad got angry at me when I told him I was leaving. 
Later on Facebook, I noticed the bride had tagged everyone that was at the wedding except, you guessed it, me. 
So now everyone hates me because I had a panic attack. I felt like I was surrounded by people who didnt give a damn about me except for a few select people. The bride wouldn't even acknowledge me when I tried to talk to her, she literally pretended like she didn't see me when I came up to her. 
How can I make this better? No one seemed to understand that if I feel like I'm not wanted somewhere, then I'm leaving. It just puts me in a panic and I start to cry and make an even bigger mess. It was one of those situations where it was supposed to be a really fun time but it just went from bad to worse. I hate feeling like a bad guy because I know I'm not. And I do regret missing out on the rest of the celebration but I would've just been crying in a corner by myself and would've created bigger drama anyway. 
I need any advice people have to give because I dont know where else to turn except just pack my things and run away forever so I'm not a bother to anyone anymore. Please help me.",1

I did have an hour, but for twenty minutes I sat down wondering to myself ‘should I do it? Will people judge me if I just pull out a full make-up bag and start? What if it looks bad? What if people stare and watch while I’m doing it?’ But once I checked how much longer I had before I would get to work, I just gave in and said ‘fuck it,’ and started going at it.

477,"Picked the Work/School flair because most of my issues centralize around work. This is going to be kinda long, but I appreciate any time you take reading it or the TLDR. 

Background: I’m a very successful engineer for my age (25M). I live alone, am on track to buy a house within about 2 years, have my dream car that I’ve wanted since I was 12, am in the best shape of my life, and really don’t have many responsibilities outside of work. 

I grew up in an unstable household where my parents fought multiple times a week and I was constantly worried if I caused the fight, if they were going to leave me, if I was making their marriage worse, etc. They would try to get me on their side during each fight as I’m the only child, and then when they made up, they both would gang up on me with finding shit I had done wrong. They both were also perfectionists and I would get yelled at if I had anything less than straight As or if I didn’t mow the grass perfectly (not a single blade left on the concrete type shit). I’m sure it’s contributed to a host of issues for me, one being major trust issues. My relationship with my mom is miles better, my dad and I are on semi speaking terms depending on the week. 

Despite all my successes, I can’t relax. If I’m kicking back (like right now) I feel guilty and my mind floods with a bunch of “wtf are you doing just lounging around” type comments. It gets really bad, to the point that I almost killed myself Senior year of college due to stress, and I’ve debated it since I was a kid, rather the thought that “I could run away and no one would give a fuck” when I was a kid because killing myself seemed unfathomable. I have no intention of killing myself, so no need to worry about that, but it definitely pops in my head a lot and I think about it, I just know I have the control to never do it. 

I also have an unreasonable but very intrusive worry that I’m going to lose everything. Whether it be a health issue, my work deciding to fire me, or anything really, I’m constantly worried about if I did anything wrong and am going to lose everything soon. Keep in mind, I have enough money saved up that I could quit and survive for another 2ish years with no change to my lifestyle. I’m pointing this out to show how unreasonable my worries are, not to brag. 

I don’t know what to do. I feel like I’m completely disconnected from reality and am just going through the motions. I don’t actively feel involved in conversations, I hardly eat anymore (I’m 6’7” and I eat maybe around 1500 calories a day because I have no appetite), and anything that happens I feel like is just “how it is” whether good or bad. I honestly can’t remember the last time I laughed genuinely (but I always make others laugh), and I physically can’t get myself to cry (it’s probably been about 5 years since I’ve cried. 

I’m mainly looking to see if anyone knows how to get my spark for life back. I can’t see myself doing this for the next 50+ years of my life. 

TLDR: I feel like a bystander in my life and have no self motivation or feelings it seems. I’m very successful but that doesn’t resonate with my mind at all.

Ever since I moved back tho, my anxiety has gotten so bad, I have hard time going to the store to buy groceries.

I never finished school, so now I'm basically stuck at home making shit music to distract myself from my problems.

My main problem now is sleep. I have a panic attack almost everytime I'm about to go to sleep. I live by distracting myself with stuff so I dont need to think about life, but when going to sleep, you cant really have yourself distracted.

This has resulted in me not sleeping for days, until i crash and the cycle repeats..

I'm curious if my elevated anxiety levels that I've been experiencing, could be due to me quitting weed?

 Its not constant and some days I feel fine and don't worry so much, but other days, like today hence why I am reaching out to this forum hoping that people here will understand, it feels like I am being crushed from the inside.

 My whole body is tense for hours and my mind won't stop racing. I consider myself to be average in most ways and I am no stranger to humility or humiliation but I would say I am a deeper thinker than most people I know. Not smarter, but more in depth in the way I think. I obsess to be honest, its not something I enjoy and often wish I could just rip that part of my mind out and be ignorant to the woes of the human condition.

 I have had a lot of loss and damage in my past, mainly losing my mother young followed by my father rekindling an old flame to be led down a path of drug addiction and bad choices. I know many people suffer far greater sorrows and I in no way feel like I am special or deserving of any kind of special treatment in the scope of every persons individual experience, but these are mine and thus is my world view. 

My main problem is the combination of obsessive thought processes accompanied by the anxiety driven physical and mental stressors that make me feel like I am just on the precipice of the next disaster in my life. Almost all the time. 

This makes the things in life I dislike make me feel more intensely that doom is waiting, and the things I love to be clouded by the negative thoughts and feelings.

483,"**TLDR:** Today was a great day. Part of my long recovery to stability after a relapse. Seems to have ended on an ugly note. Cause some panic...

****

After a relapse on the weekend my life started looking up. I was doing so much better. Feeling so much better. Started acting like me. ate breakfast (with some struggle), showered, brushed teeth, went to class, talked to a girl I like (made me feel so much better), ate lunch with her, dropped her off at her house, went off roading for a bit to let go of some stress, went to work. Work was fine. I got a bit hungry so I bought a nature valley oat bar thing and ate it with some water. 

Felt good at work but doubt was lingering in the back of mind. So much doubt. Came home hungry for dinner. Was ready to eat like my normal self. Went home, had a warming talk with family, I even thought about all my hobbies I wanted to continue since my meltdown. Kinda pick at some the dinner sides. Doubt still lingering around my head. Served myself. Sat in my room and started to eat watching youtube as I usually do.

&amp;#x200B;

then it happened. I felt off. And after SOME eating I wanted to stop. That is when I got an attack. Panic filled me up, terror, fear, unease, I repeated ""Oh God please God not again. I want to eat. I want to be normal.""

Felt some dull pain in my lower center area. Felt void of energy. Weak. Afraid. I started saying ""I want to go home, I don't want to do this anymore.""

it went away and now im slowly eating again. mouth feels dry and I feel very thirsty. perhaps I was just thirsty. I never really drink Pure Leaf and it has a L O T of sugar.

486,"I have had some very positive, demonstrable results from supplementing Ashwagandha, to the point where I honestly wondered why more people hadn't mentioned it on this sub before.

Ashwagandha is a commonly used herb in the Ayurvedic tradition. I had heard of it a few times before, but after seeing some of the research I decided to give it a shot.

I have suffered from ADHD-like symptoms for my entire life, but after this recent experience, I am convinced that anxiety is a huge component of my attention issues. Since supplementing ashwagandha for a month, I have noticed that my tendency to be sidetracked has been almost completely wiped out. I am now much more able to tackle even very difficult problems with almost zero distraction.

Another thing that made its impact obvious to me was when I once took too much. I noticed that I felt so peaceful and calm about everything that I was not very motivated to work. This was surprising, but also helpful, as I often work too much/hard and have a hard time taking appropriate breaks. This sort of helped demonstrate what it was like to take a proper break.

The clinical science is promising, though not expansive. I'll try to document some of what I found here:

[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3573577/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3573577/)

Sample size: 64

Study Length: 60 days, daily supplementation

Average reduction of reported Perceived Stress Score: -44%

There are other metrics here as well, but I don't want to quote the entire thing here. They are also markers of stress, anxiety, depression, and health.

&amp;#x200B;

https://i.redd.it/4hmgd98c0sp21.jpg

This is really cool! These results are very promising.

There is also a meta-analysis available: [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4270108/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4270108/)

Have in mind that the transcription is not perfect at all, of course, you shouldn't rely solely on it. But it gives you a nice heads up about the subject. I will usually listen to the whole audio after I thought about it, but with much less anxiety now that I know what it is about.

After the second one, I have been experiencing what feels like overworked muscles, where the lactic acid really makes them burn, but all the time, not just after intense activity.

I googled a little and didn't find much. I almost passed out from the pain today and am worried this is more serious than just lactic acid ",1

494,"I’ve been with my boyfriend for 7 months and we’ve been generally great up until the past couple months. I’m 24 and he’s 20 and he lives with me. (I live I a shared house with 7 others for uni)
At first I would barely say a few words to him and he would start every convo on our dates etc and he was always great with my anxiety, we took things very slow. 

We have come so far in the 7 months we’ve been together I’m completely myself, I can chat to him about anything now. 

However, we had a fight yesterday and he says I make him feel small when I get mad at him because I shut down and just ‘blank him’ over nothing. I have tried to explain to him that I don’t mean to do this and that it’s just an automatic thing I do to cope in these situations. He got really mad at me and started saying how it’s not normal that I don’t kiss him first or hug him first and that he hasn’t seen me without makeup yet. I thought this was totally unfair to say as there’s nothing I want more than to be ‘normal’ and be able to do those things with him but I felt like he was rushing me and making me feel like a freak. 


He broke up with me there and then and I sent him a message explaining all this to him and he says he wants to talk tomorrow. I don’t know what to do, he says he understands but he doesn’t or he wouldn’t of said all that and he wouldn’t have broken up with me. 

He knows how high my anxiety is, I do take Citalopram but have been feeling very down recently and my anxiety has gotten so bad that I just haven’t gone into uni this year and he started laying into me about that telling me that I just need to do it like it’s that easy. 

I don’t know if I should be with him or what I should do?

495,"I find summer and the build up to summer a terrible time for my anxiety. So much pressure to be happy that the weather getting better (as if that's enough to be happy). So much expectation to be out enjoying yourself more because the days are longer, evenings brighter. So many more social activities are scheduled - parties, BBQs, after work drinks, family trips. So many more warm days that require less clothes and much more scrutiny on my body. 

I could go on forever. Anyone else already mourning the loss of being able to hide behind a thick scarf and a puffy coat, and the helpful excuse that its dark and cold so its a good reason stay home on their sofa?",1

497,"I have had depression and anxiety much of my life. I generally play it safe and would stay in my comfort zone far too often, which includes my once stable job. I always thought that if I put in the effort I would probably stay at the company until I retire. A change in management caused my sense of job security to drop and anxiety spike. Many people have quit specifically because of new boss so I know it wasn't just me. I survived for the past 5+ years since the shakeup, but there are trends within my group and the company that I can no longer ignore. While I am not going to get fired anytime soon, the stress of an unhealthy workplace (boss) has made my life a mess.


The issue isn't just my current job's stability either. I work in a niche field and job opportunities are relatively uncommon unless I move a few states away. That alone was enough to make my anxiety spike even prior to the new boss taking over. I am not sure I want to do this kind of job anymore either; the pay is good but I am a rather burnt out. After a not so stellar annual review I got recently, I decided a change is required. I had had enough.


I have always loved to create things. From physical things like planning and installing a paver brick patio all by myself, to software like making simple programs, or working on graphics. I have always had a dream to make my own video games but never really put enough effort into making it happen, until now. I put together a calendar with my own deadlines, started writing notes and outlines on all the things I want to do, and finally got serious. I already have put in a solid 30 hours the last few weeks. Whats strange is that even though I am treating this like a part time job on the side, I now wake up looking forward to each day to work on it. I have a renewed sense of purpose that is helping me in my battle with anxiety.


TL;DR: Retreating to my comfort zone was not healthy in the long run. I realized that If I want change, I have to make serious attempts to make it happen. ",1
498,"Curious what you all think about this and it’s something I’ve been contemplating recently:

I really enjoy bourbon. The taste, the flavor, the burn, and of course, the way it relaxes me and helps me switch in to “me” time! I particularly like one brand and if they don’t have my preference, I’d rather not drink at all. That being said, if they don’t have it, I’ll just wait and have some when I get home instead. It’s my favorite part of closing down the stress of the day and moving in to relaxation mode for the evening. When I go abroad, I bring a few nips of my brand because honestly, I would prefer not to drink anything else, but I still want to be able to enjoy a drink after the day. Though I guess I would actually have something else? Maybe a small amount but definitely not much. Side note, i actually bring some food items with me when I travel too, for the same reason...I really like my daily routine and like to have specific snacks at certain times of the day. 

I have 1-2 every day with dinner or while cooking. Sometimes I’ll have 3, but usually lose the desire to keep going after that (i never during the day or with lunch, unless there’s a rare outing or event that calls for it, otherwise, water only...I don’t even want it). On the weekends, it may be a bit more at night but max only 1 more (4 total), because honestly, I like getting buzzed, but not super drunk, and never blackout. 

The conundrum is that I do have anxiety sometimes, and while I love this routine, the anxious side of me is terrified of being called an alcoholic because I really do enjoy it so much and don’t want to cut it out of my day. So, the big question is, am I addicted, dependent or just really obsessed with my routine (I def have some OCD tendencies and like things structured to be the same every day)? I like it, it hasn’t really interfered with my life, and I don’t need to keep going once I’ve had a few (No need to clear the bottle), though we do all get a bit carried away now and then I suppose!

If you can’t tell, I’m extremely routine oriented, so no question, if I take a few nights off, I’ll miss it and probably crave it because, again, it’s like a favorite reward after the day.... I look forward to it! How do I know if I’m craving the alcohol or the routine? Does any of this sound like a problem? And before anyone says “if you have to ask, it is”, just know that anxiety makes you think everything is a problem! Haha. I’m also realizing how crazy some of this sounds, but just know, I’m being brutally honest. Feedback welcome!",1
499,"I was raised with pretty good manners. I was always taught to say hi to people or give at least a polite nod. Not only is it nice, but it can help lead into actual conversations

However, this doesn’t work if no one ever says hi back. I make sure not to interrupt anyone’s their phone or with headphones in unless I really want to, which isn’t often. 

Even if I make eye contact and give a wave people just seem to look and ignore me, but I’ve barley see anyone else dealing with this. It’s just that no one says hi to me. I don’t get many good mornings or goodbyes. It makes me feel super weird and awkward.

I know it sounds super needy, I just wish people noticed me a little more. I don’t want to be the center of attention but a smile a day is always a nice way to go and gives me a little rush of happiness too :(",1

I'm a college graduate in no debt making $15/hr in a job related to my dream career while trying to get on track to go back to school. I have a good amount of money saved up, and a boyfriend with a great job who's constantly telling me to be less frugal and that I can buy things and enjoy life. But everytime I talk to my dad, the question comes up and my anxiety makes me feel like I'm not doing enough. Does anyone else have this? Also, any ideas of what to do?

I don't know if it was anything bad intentionally but when we passed each other leaving the college cafeteria our eyes met for a bit but she just looked away and almost ignored me.

Not wanting to say something because my anxiety told me it was stupid) but now, I've been having points where it's not even explainable like that, just pure anxiety without a thought process, locking me down so I dont even do anything, just frozen in place with a blank mind.

Today in school I had my water bottle under my shoulder while I was taking something out of my bag and I try getting past this group of people and end up accidentally dropping my bottle. It drops and hits some people’s feet and then is on the floor and there is people talking to their friends in the corridor and none of them are looking at me so I guess they didn’t notice but for some reason I could not bring myself to pick it up for fear of embarrassment or confrontation and so I didn’t pick it up and just went to my next lesson. As I’m walking away I’m thinking “why why why can’t you pick that bottle up you piece of sh*t” it actually is like a wall preventing me from doing stuff. I just can’t bring myself to do stuff where I will be looked at or judged or FEEL like I’m being looked at or judged even if I know I’m most likely not. I also am like a door mat and am afraid of saying no when people ask me to borrow stuff and even when I REALLY wanna say no I can’t bring myself to say it. I also am really bad at having eye contact with someone I haven’t talked to often before. it’s especially hard when I have to talk to girls. So..do I have anxiety?

510,"❗Trigger warning: I'll describe my fear shortly, don't want it to scare you.❗


So my way of coping with anxiety is ridiculing my fears and using rationality and logic to destruct them. It's like in Harry Potter where humour is used to tear down irrational fears except I rather use science than normal magic. 

Like honestly, if it wasn't for free scientific research on the internet about anxiety I wouldn't be in a good place. I assume some people feel the same and thus I wanted share some excellent truth about anxiety. I'm writing this post mainly to help fellow anxious people and also to distract myself from my ridiculous fears since my friends are asleep right now and I don't want to wake them.

So basically my biggest fear right now, mainly because of all the stress and anxiety I've been having over the past few years is that I'll lose my mind and turn into some Hulk like version of me and end up hurting anyone. Especially because sometimes my brain feels so idk electrified after stress that I'm scared it might damage my brain. Which is as ridiculous as it sounds, especially considering I'm a vegan and a pacifist who often cares too much about other people rather than himself.

So here are some truth about anxiety: 


Believing you are about to lose your mind is a common catalyst to a panic attack, where the fear of losing your mind and the changes the stress response make fuel each other.

But even though the fear of going crazy can be frightening, it’s not an indication of a problem with your brain, mind, or sanity. It’s just another indication that your body is experiencing a stress response and/or of a body that’s overly stressed.

People who have been under a lot of stress often experience this symptom.

It's important to note that there is no connection between anxiety and going crazy. While it may feel like you could go crazy due to anxiety, you actually can't. It's a physical impossibility.

Ergo, sometimes, anxiety is like this thing that can make you think the worst fears even though a lot of these fears have no base in reality. For me it helps to remember that my fears are irrational and to look at the data that is out there. 

For example, to get back to my fear. In the past 22 years of my life I've never turned in the Hulk monster that I fear to become, nor am I in that state now and there is no good reason to believe I'll be in that state anytime soon. I've been through worse panic attacks and I'm still me, therefore my Hulk fear is very unlikely.

511,I'm already quite convinced that everything everyone is telling me is a lie and that I'm being long term hoodwinked. So to have an entire blooming day dedicated to people probably trying to deceive you is absolutely tiresome and a definite trigger to my anxiety. And I effing hate it. ,1

517,"Hi all, TL;DR below.

First, about me.  I have had anxiety.  I have had it my whole life.  I was able to control a lot of it because my family told me to ""suck it up and quit feeling sorry for myself"" as loving families to.  This of course led to many breakdowns, most of which were done alone, as to not shame myself or the FaMiLy!  I turned to alcohol and pot because I was a hoot when wasted.

Good, friends, a good wife, and overcoming fears has helped.  I still take a bit of anti anxiety that has really helped too.  I now drink a beer or two on occasion, that's about it.

I see myself in my youngest daughter.  She is 12,  over emotional and anxious for many things, yet she is so creative.  Anyway, she had to do a report on something she knew nothing about.  It was due in two days, had to be both as an essay and a powerpoint pres.  Her initial reaction was one of fear, crying, even rage.  Just bringing up that she had a 3 minute presentation (to 40 friends and family) had her in a panic.

She and I sat down and did the report.  It didn't take too long and we had a nice report in her words within a couple hours, along with sources and a powerpoint.

Now she had knowledge of what she was going to speak about.  She wrote down the highlights for her speech (basically the point from the presentation) and she started to practice.

God it was painful.  The first few times She couldn't even start.  If she stumbled over a word she'd freeze up and start crying.  All of this was just in front of me!  I found that letting her go through it without me adding ""helpful"" information was better.

Eventually she could get through it with out crying and only the fear of death on her face.  A few more times and she wasn't stumbling through.  A couple more and she was going so fast that she had to slow down so that she was within the minimum time.

The next morning she put her notes on easier to read note cards and practiced a few more times.  By the time she did the speech for real she looked like a pro, and even made eye contact.  I was so proud of her, and she was proud of herself.

Public speaking can still induce panic in me, and I am a 51 yo guy.  But, if I know my shit, I am fine.  Confidence (an passion) in knowing what you are talking about helps so much.

518,"I honestly wasn’t sure where to post this so apologies if it doesn’t belong here. I’ve been feeling like quite a few close “friends” and family in my life are extremely selfish.

They barely even know what I’m up to - no idea what my job is, how my relation is going, etc. because they NEVER ask.

It was especially bad this past week (I have a personal relationship with someone at work, and the other day I was trying to help by telling him something, but he still went to confirm anyway... I'm probably just being stupid, but that kinda hurt.. I ended up pretty much rushing out of work for a lunch break because my anxiety was getting bad. I even had to take a breather in the bathroom, which was a first for me..)

Today was the first day I felt it was a good day. Honestly I attribute a big part of it to the person I worked with today. He's an amazing mentor. He goes above and beyond answering my questions, and I feel like I've learned a lot from him in one day. He also doesn't make me feel like an outsider, or make me feel useless, and tells me he appreciates my help. I think, sometimes being around people that make you feel important, or special, helps with the anxiety..

I can't sleep, I get really vicious nightmares and wake up sweating, I can't seem to be relaxed or calm down, and I get physically sick entering different rooms.

525,"Hi all. Throwaway account. I would really appreciate some advice. Currently in third semester of grad school, specializing in Computational Chemistry. When I applied for my research group, the advisor had expressed to me that he was planning to retire soon, but was willing to give me a shot. So far my experience has been relatively good, and my advisor has been helpful with any research related help I've needed. The last few weeks however, I've been questioning whether I really belong in the program. Back in October I got out of an extremely toxic friend relationship that I didn't realize was abusive until I started going to my therapist. Ever since the ""Friend"" left, I felt like I've been slipping. My fear of failure and paranoia that people (including my advisorand especially other grad students) hate me and don't think I belong in the program has shot through the roof. The class I teach is a senior level lab, and I'm the only TA who's ran it in the department, as the other experienced TA's have graduated. I've had to spend this semester coaching a first semester TA through the course that I barely know myself, as I'd only ran it once before. My work production has slowed to a crawl due to a combination of this and the fact that calculations we ran took almost 10x longer than we were expecting. I've tried my best to muscle my way through it, but it feels like the floor is falling out under me. My office is right next to my instructor's, and about a week and a half ago, I'd overheard him talking about me and I feel like during my third semester review I'm going to get dropped from the program. I had a panic attack in my office, but didn't tell him. I tried opening up to him a bit, and apologized to him last week but I'm worried he might've seen it as just making excuses right before the review. I honestly don't know what I'll do if I'm dropped. I started seeing a therapist in December, and have mentioned this offhand to my advisor, but understandably he is relatively distant when it comes to personal matters like this. I feel like I'm going to get dropped from the program because of a shithead I've tried my hardest to cut out of my life.

Hey guys 21 year old male here. I have bene suffering from GAD + Anticipation anxiety since I was a small child + severe insomnia (that has led to breakdowns and crying after 5-8 consecutive days without sleeping due to anxiety).

It's at this moment I really figured out the range of Benzos, I only heard of Xanax, but when I walked out with my script and googled klonopin it made me optimistic. Yes, it finally put me to sleep for about 6 months. I saw this psych for 2 years then I turned 18 and decided to stop taking meds. It's to long of a story to go into all the semantics right now.

**Anyways, going to see a 1 psych on Wednesday and another on Friday. I do not plan on releasing previous med information as its not necessary other than the basics. I am a student + I have a internship at a insurance company I don't want to fuck up.  can't continue to not sleep**

**My primary care doc has been prescribing me Klonopin .5 because I asked for 3 months now, it's the 4th month and I asked him for 60 .5mg now. This will probably be my final script guys. I need a psych asap. I've tried every SSRI ever. Feel free to ask questions I'll answer, trying to keep this short.**

  
**What I am asking is, what should I reasonably ""suggest"" to receive as a form of treatment Klonopin + their suggestions, Temazepam for sleep? Halcion? Xanax + Klonopin in combination therapy? I've been prescribed this before as a teen at 16. Kps + xans**",1
528,So I quit smoking about 2-3 months ago but after the first month I smoked one cig and the anxiety got worse. Then again a week later I smoked one cig and got even worse. Then hey guess what again I’m stupid enough to smoke one more a week later. Now it’s been like 3-4 weeks after that last one I’m never going back to them again. But now everyday it seems like my anxiety is getting worse and worse. For example I feel the normal fast heart rate then slowly I get nauseous and feel like I’m going to vomit. But every time that has happen I don’t I just have a big burp. Then I happens again right after but not as intense. And it happens mostly everyday. Has anyone else gone through this exact same anxiety attack?  If so how do you avoid the nauseousness ,1
529,"For about 6 years since gaining debt (car, paying for rent, utilities, etc.) I have been afraid of missing time from work. I will put off doctor's visits, ignore things that I should have checked out, and self diagnose things based off of endless reading.

I have anxiety of losing my car, my home, not being able to provide for my wife and son, and requiring a costly medical procedure that I cannot afford if I do have things checked out. This anxiety stems from the fear of being out of work and being fired by my employer. I'm sure the male mindset of just toughing things out also comes into play, but the fear of being fired due to need of medical care scares me into procrastinating medical appointments. I think sometimes I'm also afraid of being told I have a bad problem that will require surgery (another fear) or be something that is life altering.  

How can I break free of this anxiety to take better care of myself not only for my own health but for my family's sake also? ",1

531,"I just watched a video of a little boy drowning in a pool. It brought me right back.

I was at a pool party, didn't know how to swim, had a life vest most of the party, then gave my life vest to my best friend (we were like 5) then I decided I could swim and jumped in, I indeed could not swim and I was under, drowning, inhaling water and no adult saw me. My best friend with her life jacket ended up grabbing my arm and pulling me to the stairs and when I told the adults no one belived me. My mom didn't believe me until I threw up the chlorine water all night long . Now I'm like a cat and don't goin water unless it's like 200 degrees outside.

I feel like this event made me scared of everything. I almost faced death. I faced helplessness. I faced aloneness. I faced the fact that you are very alone even with everyone around.

It makes me sick thinking about it. I never realized how this event really has been a part of my life, my entire life.

Maybe I'm just really sensitive. 

I mean in an adult now. I faced my fears and did learn how to swim, despite the fact I hate water and will the rest of my life.

I still force myself to do things I fear, but that doesn't mean I don't feel the anxiety.bi short ess of breath, my limbs going numb, racing thoughts or even blank thoughts. 

I'm overwhelmed all the time it seems. I have a hard time facing life. But I do it. Wish I could get rid of anxiety though.... ",1

533,"Hi everyone, I'm 22 and about to graduate from my community college with   an associate's in studio arts. Afterwards I would move on to a four  year  college to finish. The thing is, I'm having these recurring waves  of  feeling... like I've ruined my life. Up to high school I wanted to  do  something in medicine, but I realized that I hated school, and going  to  college, that I was also completely uninterested in pursuing  science.

At  the same time, I have  always loved art and I've kept up  drawing/painting the whole time, so  eventually I decided to switch my  major to studio arts - and when  transferring to a four year school, I  will be double majoring in  digital art as well. I'm genuinely excited to  do anything art related,  and I think I've become pretty good at it -  showing promise, you know?  The thing is, I've been having some stress  related health issues  lately, so I thought after graduating I would take  a semester off and  start posting my art online, which is something I've  never done before.

But  I keep getting  these horrible feelings that I'm ruining my life, or  I'll never be able  to support myself financially. That maybe I should  have stuck to  studying science, even if I don't enjoy it. It happens in  periods of a  couple of days, usually, where I feel like my life is  just... over.

I'm just freaking out about it.",1
534,"If anyone can offer any help or advice It'd really mean a lot.  I've swung in and out of mild depression for years, and always had bad anxiety as early as 15.  There's been a lot of stages where I feel fine, and a lot of depprssive ones, it's kinda been all over the place in the last few years.  

I was extremely happy, in good shape, eating well, saving a few months ago.  But it all came apart in the span of about 2 months. I dropped out of school, lost my job, blew threw my entire savings, lost almost 30pounds and lost most of my friends  I've been through a lot in my life but the last two months I've had everything come back and much stronger than before.  

The last week I've been having daily mood swings and sometimes it's really intense.. Like sober euphoria, or really happy, then just a few hours later it goes back to deppressive.  I've had 3 panic attacks in the last two weeks, I've never had any in my life before that.  I'm having really intense pins/needles feeling all over my chest, this caused one of my panic attacks a few days ago and I went to the ER for it.  Doctor said everything looked fine physically and sent me on my way.  Since that my anxiety has gotten much worse, I can hardly leave my room.  My hunger is gone, like all day, I have no urge to eat.  I either sleep too much or too little.  It all just came so fast like I've never had it before.   ",1
535,"Hey guys!

Just wanted to share my experience with anxiety and panic attacks and how I'm convinced I cured them.

Backstory: 

I've always been an anxious person (it runs in my family), but around October 2018 I started experiencing panic attacks that scared me enough to put me in the ER a handful of times only to be told that I had anxiety. It was debilitating and exhausting - It got to a point where would have at least three panic attacks a day and I started getting mild agoraphobia. I felt on edge 24/7 and every little feeling in my body would send my heart rate to 150-180bpm. I saw my primary care doctor, she told me I had anxiety. I saw a cardiologist, she told me I had anxiety....anxiety anxiety anxiety.

&amp;#x200B;

Finally, about two months ago, I decided to join in with my mom on an instagram challenge called ""4 Days Without Sugar"" - not for anxiety purposes but because I thought it would be a good challenge to do to detox a bit. Three days go by and I'm still feeling the same, but with a lot more energy. By day four, my panic attacks were gone and I was feeling like the girl I used to be. My energy levels were high and I was also losing weight (winning!) - I decided to stick with it since it was benefiting me so much. Fast forward two months and I haven't had a single panic attack since!!! I tried a little experiment and ate a piece of cake a couple of weeks ago...after about 30 mins I started feeling shortness of breath and palpitations again - CRAZY!! I got to researching and turns out there's an interesting connection between the gut and the brain, and sugar and processed foods affect your brain negatively. Pretty nuts!!

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway, I wanted to share my experience because it might help someone on here as well - YOU'VE GOT THIS!! :)",1
536,"I've considered going to a therapist off and on for the past 4-5 years, and I think I'm finally ready to take that step. My stress/anxiety is affecting my life to the point where I can no longer ignore it. It's affecting my career goals, relationships, and daily life, and I refuse to let it run my life anymore.

537,"I drove 5 under the speed limit most of the time, but at times I even went the same speed as everyone else.

538,"So my problem is that I have troubles attending classes due to my social anxiety. I'm on my 3rd year of university and I attend two classes at the moment, each once a week. Participation isn't mandatory, but I still feel like I should attend as much as possible to learn as much as possible and hopefully improve my grades this summer.  
The problem for me is that I find it really difficult just to show up. It hasn't been always been a problem and I used to attend most classes without worrying the first couple of semesters. But whenever I think of going to class, I start to feel anxious, I start to sweat and get nauseous and start to fear all kinds of crazy scenarios like vomiting in front of everyone or passing out - which has never happened before, but still something that I fear will happen. I really don't want to make a fool out of myself or show my anxiety to others.  
This has been going on for a month or so now and each time I want to improve, but I usually end up getting so scared of what COULD happen in the classroom that I end up not going and just study at home instead. I'm really afraid that it's going to hurt my grades and that I've already screwed up everything by not showing up.  
I do go to therapy and I also have a mentor in which we practice using public transportation, but the classroom thing is still a major issue and I have trouble sharing my issues, even with my therapist.   
My question is then: Does anyone else have this problem and what's your best method for actually going to class and getting a good experience? I'm sure that it'll get better once I can get myself to show up and make a habit out of it, but right now it's extremely hard just to get to campus since I start to feel anxious and even physically ill before showing up at all.",1
539,"In 2015 I was prescribed 75mg of Zoloft for panic attacks caused by physical health problems I had at the time. Last year I decided I was in a good enough place to wean off them. It hasn't been nearly as bad as some other people's experiences I've been reading, but it hasn't been easy either. Mostly I'm getting dizziness, tinnitus, and increased anxiety. I take 25mg every 3 days now, so I'm on the home stretch, but this is the most difficult reduction yet. I take holy basil when I feel like I need it, and try to eat foods that naturally boost serotonin. Any advice on coping? Luckily my withdrawal symptoms don't tend to last longer than a month, so I'm comforted by knowing that. Thanks :)",1
540,"Hey everyone, I’m sorry if there’s been a post similar to this. I feel when ever I get a bad thought or an anxious feeling in my body it sets off a reaction that incapacitates me. All I want to do is lay in bed or smoke and drink or just do nothing, let time pass by and force my mine to go blank. It makes me feel worthless. I have started to wake up most mornings with thoughts of suicide, and the fact my brain has begun to take me to that place scares the fuck out of me. I don’t know how to ask for help IRL, I am to the point when I really just don’t believe in myself anymore. After seeing the description for this page I thought that this could be a good place to start though. so my question to you all is, when you start to get that feeling inside you, what is your first move or the steps you would take to help without just bottling them up and trying to forget??

So I’ve suffered from OCD (some online call it Pure OCD) for 6 years, I’ve had enough and I’ve decided to go to the doctors and get medication.

543,"I was fine up until the interview itself. Wasn’t very nervous at all, and I felt quite confident. Then came the questions about why I’m in my field, why I’m not employed at the moment, and then they asked me if I have interviews very often. I didn’t expect that, and at that point it derailed me. I’m pretty sure they were commenting on how inexperienced or nervous I seemed, and I thought I came off as knowledgeable and confident. Not the case, apparently. After my awkward answer to their question (something along the lines of “not in a while, the last one was last year and I was not seriously looking for another job at the time”), they shook my hand and told me they’ll make a decision within the next couple weeks after they interview a few others. I didn’t really feel a connection between us at all, and sensed little to no common ground. I keep telling myself I’m glad I went, but in all honesty I just wanna hide from the world. I can’t do that, I gotta keep looking and opening more doors. Maybe look into working with animals, which I love dearly and care deeply about. Idk. I just wish I weren’t so awkward. I’m normally good with interviews, too! This just wasn’t meant to be, I guess. It’s just hard to not beat myself up over it.",1
544,My very first therapy session is coming up soon!!!! It's on Tuesday April 9 at 10 in the morning. I'm actually really excited for it.,1
545,"I apologize in advance for the wall of text coming. I'm on mobile and will try to break it up as much as possible. 

I've posted before about my anxiety that came on very suddenly almost 7 years ago. I was fine one day and not the next. I loved driving, it was my ""think"" time. I was very social and going places and meeting new people.

 One day, after a short drive down the interstate and while stopped at an intersection, I got very dizzy, vision blurred and I had a massive panic attack. Every time after that when I drove the panic attacks would come on almost immediately. After that, even being in a vehicle would cause vertigo, dizziness, nausea, panic attacks, racing intrusive thoughts and headaches.

 Then I became unable to do my own grocery shopping and had to pay others to do my errands. I was miserable and isolated. I felt like an utter failure as a person and a mother. I eventually lost my job my house and my car because I could no longer drive or even stand to be in public without feeling awful. Lights were too bright and everything made me dizzy. Eventually I became depressed because of my isolation but I kept on.

Everyone I talked to told me I needed meds. Doctors said the same thing but I had this strong feeling that something was physically wrong with me, not chemically. For the last 6 1/2 years I searched and searched and nothing fit. I had never been in an accident, not had anything particularly scary happen, no head injuries.... so what happened?!

 Last year while, again, searching for my answer I found an eye condition called vertical heterophoria. I got excited. Could it be my eyes?! I had all the symptoms and it made total sense. As soon as my husband got home we went to the local walmart eye center to have me examined. The Doctor told me there was nothing wrong with my eyes and that I should get my head examined instead. I am near quoting him! I cried all the way home, ugly snot tears. 

Since then I kept reading about vertical heterophoria. It just made too much sense. I found out the your regular eye Dr can't diagnose this because there isn't anything wrong with your eyes individually. You can still see but your eyes are constantly straining. 

I filled out a survey online for the specialist in Michigan and the next day I got a call. They had an office in Kentucky and wanted me to come in.

 We made all the plans and went up there this past Wednesday. I was an absolute WRECK on the drive up there. It's a 10 hour drive from where we live and just a 30 minute drive is torture for me. God bless my husband and kids for being there to support me or I wouldn't have made it. 

The next day I go in for my exam. They did 5 different tests and scans of my eyes. Then the Doctor did a few more test where I had to cover one eye and follow a laser on a scoreboard and read. He put these crazy looking glasses on me and we started figuring out which prisms I could see through. Almost as soon as he had the right ones in there I felt my mind relax. I was so calm! Before I had the glasses on I couldn't see the last two lines of the eye chart and the board I was reading off of looked weird. After wearing them just 20 minutes I could read almost everything! I had no idea my vision was so bad. He showed me a chart of something near and far with green lines where I should see and red where I did see. It was no where near where it should be. I'm looking past everything! When he had to take the glasses off I got so dizzy I thought I would faint. My whole world spun around. I couldn't afford to get the glasses right then ($650) so I set up payments with them for over the phone since we live so far away. He told me for the ride home to cover 1 eye and that should help a little. A LITTLE?! I was able to sit up and enjoy the ride home! See the mountains and cities and traffic and I felt a little wobbly but I was calm. I probably said ""this is amazing"" 100 times on the way home. 

Within the next couple of weeks I should have my glasses and the Dr said to wait 2 weeks for my eyes to fully adjust and then I could start driving. I'm already making plans to take my kids fishing and hiking, to the water park and getting a job! I've missed people! Once I have my glasses I will post an update. 

 The Dr told me that some people are so off balance that they walk in the office with a cane and once they have their glasses they walk straight out! That's amazing! He also said that I was most likely born with this and as I got older I was less able to compensate and my eyes and brain eventually said no. Looking back, that makes sense. I had subtle symptoms since I was 18 (32 now) and never considered my eyes or even that anything was wrong, until I couldn't drive. 

I hope this post reaches someone out there who feels stuck and hopeless like I did. Specialists for this seem pretty spread out but it is worth the trip and the money to feel better. To truly address the problem! It is all worth it. 

TL:DR- thought I had anxiety turns out my eyes don't play well together.",1
546,"So I decided to do solo travelling because the few friends of mine don't have time, are busy or financially limited. 
And I said fuck it, you either stay home depressed or finally do something „exciting“ like travelling on your own.

I know that no one knows me there, even if they look at me in a restaurant eating by myself. But still, it bothers me. How can I overcome this?",1

I posted something recently but I have a couple follow up points because my situation has evolved. I'm currently seeing this guy (26M) I'm 22F. He's a former Marine, absolutely adorable, and we have so much in common. We are fuck buddies turned seeing each other. We had our third date/hang out session this past weekend. We went all over town, got dinner, and stayed in an AirBnb (both our home situations aren't great for a partner to spend the night). We both discussed plans for the summer and he even invited me to the Marine ball in November if things work out. I am very excited with all of these prospects. But my anxiety is spiking like crazy. Nothing has ever worked out for me. Nothing past a few weeks at least. I haven't had a longer term relationship in years.

I am worried I'm annoying him, I'm coming on too strong already, and if I ask him to be with me in a few weeks I'll get shot down. We have been talking for over a month.

My friend got me a new job in a tourist attraction in my city. Prior to my start date I had a birthday party to attend, then the next day I had another birthday to attend which was my own.  I had one rest day where I was completely dead from going out and drinking. All my friends and family were so supportive and congratulatory towards me because they know how big a step this is for me, I haven't been employed in a year and a half. Last night I went to be at midnight, which is not great but by my standards not the worst either. I woke up about 5 time between 12 and 7 for long periods of time and felt as if I was going to get sick, as well as sweating. I had my first induction session that lasted 8 hours. For a decent part of the induction I was fighting off a panic attack and not even focusing on what was going on. Finally we get to the place I'm going to be working at and its covered in fluorescent lighting, which triggers the derealization I sometimes experience, but is my worst fear. I simply can't work in this area and even some of the other parts of the place are anxiety inducing to me. I really don't feel up to the task.

I came home feeling soulless because I was so tired and anxious all day. I came home and my parents are super happy for me, but it makes me feel worse because I feel like I'm going to let them down. I feel like I'm going to let everyone down again. All my friends have showed me a lot of support and are genuinely happy for me and I feel as if I won't be able to work in this place. I cried for half an hour when I got home just thinking about this. I'm in again for 4 days this week, all 8 hour shifts starting early in the morning. I know I'll get another sleepless night and have a day full of fighting off panic attacks, only to be placed in a section where the fluorescent lighting drives the stake through my heart and induces some nice derealization

564,"A little background. I have anxiety that causes me to excessively worry at night about my family dying. It causes me to not be able to sleep or sleep well. Often falling asleep as I cry myself to sleep. My last dr appt he didn't refill my meds like he was supposed too. I thought he did, because he had asked which ones needed refilled I said all. Apparently it didn't happen. So, that was my last dr visit in early February. March 3rd he quit his practice for a corporate doctor kind of job. I haven't found a new doctor yet because I had thought I had about 6 months...refill period. So I was getting quotes together and then compile and figure it out. Nope.

So, my sleeping pill is out. It relaxes me, helps me sleep, keeps me asleep, and helps with bipolar depression and anxiety. So I did not sleep well last night. Then, I had a fricken cockroach on my wall from my Uncle bringing them from his house to ours when he brings all his shit to spend the night. SO giant cockroach and no sleeping meds. It was at least 2am before I fell asleep and up this morning at 530 for school. I was/am exhausted. Had class this morning, did not do well in my math class if it were test day I'd had failed. I went blank on the easiest stuff, factoring. 

So, I go down to the commons and do my homework as best I can remember...didn't do well. I'm like fine I got to pee and then I'm going to my car to wait for my sister and then go home. I go to the handicap/family bathroom because I'm like SUPER butch and women think I'm a dude, men notice the tits so their like wtf as well. So I just use the family bathroom. I walked in having to pee really bad (side note: I have overactive bladder had since I was 7) so when I have to go, I have to go. I walked in the light was off which is not normal. It was pitched black until I finally found the switch. Got me off track. I go to the bathroom..........forget to lock the door..........someone walks in. Shoot me now! 

I legit walked the long ass way to my car so I wouldn't pass by this persons office (school official).

567,"Hi reddit, I wanted to share my anxiety experience that started a month ago and maybe get some suggestions.

I was doing my math homework one ordinary day and out of the blue, I felt like I was literally dying, couldnt feel my extremities, felt like I wasnt getting enough oxygen; thought I ate something rotten at first and it made me nauseous, but in 15 minutes it was all gone and I was back to normal.

Next day, felt like I wasnt getting enough air again and panicked really hard and I started vomiting. That's where it started to happen every moment, feeling like I cant breathe and get really 'panicky' all the time. I have been going to the doctors for the past 3 weeks and they found out nothing that would cause all of this, I did everything from blood work to MRIs, everything turned out fine.

After that I went to a neurologist and got diagonsed with acute anxiety and right now I take 1/2 lorazepam tablet at night so I can sleep.

Before all of this I had an unpleasent event, I got lost in the mountains this winter and I got rescued in about 16 hours I was frozen and I am lucky I am able to write this right now; but I still dont perceive it as a moment that would cause all of this, it felt like an adventure for me, I wasnt the kind of person that would worry about death, feeling out of breath all the time and stressed. Is it really happening because of this? Everyone says so, but I cant accept it, what should I do to try to get back to normal? I feel like an alien that just wrecked his ship on Earth.

I was originally summoned back in October, when my anxiety was at its worst, and I postponed for until now. I'm now trying to postpone a second time - in part because my work and school schedules are crazy hectic. I'm considering having my therapist write a letter on my behalf as well.

I may have used the wrong term for this but it always feels like I'm overstimulated. I'm wondering if anyone have any tips to keep calm in these situations.

I’m going off the meds now in hopes that they’ll bury themselves again because it’s starting to take it’s toll on my relationship. 

Has anyone else had to make a similar mental health/childhood issues sacrifice? 

Side note: before anyone says ‘just go to therapy and sort both the issues out’ I’m a student so I really don’t have that kind of disposable income. ",1
571,"    My Mother doesn't believe that anxiety disorders exist. She tends to roll her eyes whenever they are mentioned, and is adamate about the fact that 'everyone gets nervous'. Simply speaking, she doesn't see the difference between plain nerves and anxiety. I've tried over the years to explain the difference to her, using evidence and such. She shuts it down everytime. 

    My parents are not the type to go to a doctor or a therapist for help. I am homeschooled, so needless to say, I am isolated and have no clear and confidential way to reach out of a professional on mental health. I have not been diagnosed with an anxiety disorder by a professional. However, through my research of symptoms and causes of anxiety disorders, I am comfortable with saying I have anxiety issues. 

  I get overwhelmed fairly easily. For example, I could be sitting in the living room, family members walking past me, perhaps trying to start a conversation. My heart will start racing, and I start feeling very uncomfortable. Like they are circling me. I normally escape to my room if I can. This usually ends in me being teary-eyed or zoned out for a long period of time. If I can't escape, I become irratiable and try to excuse myself to the bathroom. 

I tend to rock myself back and forth in stressfull or overwhelming situations as well, which can be very comforting. Another tick that I have that I've been trying to stop doing is picking at scabs or skin, or chewing on my lip when I'm nervous. I chew on my lip way too much, to the point where its almost always scabbed and chapped. If I'm in a situation where I need something to ground me and keep me from breaking, I tend to pick at scabs or skin in order to feel better. I know these are unhealthy habits and I try to stop them as soon as I notice they start. But its hard when your getting yelled at for something so miniscule, and your trying not to break down and hyperventilate and cry. Sometimes the easiest thing for me to do to feel better and keep my mind occupied in those situations is to scratch or pick at something. 
 
  In social situations I also get overwhelmed. I personally think that being homeschooled since 2nd Grade is a direct influence on this. Its gotten better throughout the years, especially if I can go out in public and not have to talk to anyone, but often I still come home with shakey hands and a splitting headache. 
 
  My anxiety peaks at night. Lately, I've found myself unable to sleep and restless until 1 to 2 am. My heart starts racing, and whenever I try to lay down to sleep, I immediantly want to get up and pace back and forth in my room. My thoughts tend to race, thinking about different things such as whats going to happen in the next 5 years to something that happened 5 years ago. 

  Because of my lack of sleep, I get stuck in this vicious, sleep deprived cycle. I am always tired. I wake up tired. Im never motivated. I dont want to get out of bed in the mornings because I dread what is going to happen. During my school day I can stare at my computer screen for long periods of time without even doing anything. I zone out easily. Once I come out of it I tend to break down and get frustrated with myself for not being able to concentrate. 

  Sometimes I feel like I need to run. Like that thump in your chest that you get when your playing hide and seek with your friends, and they are counting down from ten seconds as you scramble for a hiding place. But it happens so randomly. And the only way to make it go away, is for me to break out into a sprint in order to calm myself down. 

 
(Also, just a disclaimer, I'm not trying to say that I definetly have anxiety. I dont want to offend anyone by assuming that I have it. But what I do know is that what I am going through isnt normal, and anxiety is the closest thing I can link it to until I get a professional diagnosis. )

&amp;#x200B;

Use a technique called semantic conversion. It’s pretty straightforward and useful in social and office settings.  
Social anxiety has a powerful core colored by the fear of being judged by others.

This manifests in all kinds of thoughts and an anxiety action-reaction. I say action-reaction because thoughts can cause anxiety and anxiety can cause unnecessary thoughts. In fact, at times, the two are just one homogeneous blob of discomfort.

Semantic conversion has 2 steps which handle the feedback system of thoughts and physical anxiety as well as behaviors such as social avoidance.  
Step 1: Mindfulness labeling  
Step 2: Constructive rephrasing

**Step 1 Mindfulness labeling:**

We are, by default, not very aware of our own thoughts, emotions, surroundings, and perceptions, biases, and physical responses.

You begin by noticing the details. Ask the following questions:  
1. What is it about the situation that is making me anxious?  
2. What are all the emotions I am feeling?  
3. Who are the thoughts related to?  
4. Do you actually know what people are thinking?  
5. Do they have a real basis for forming any judgment?

**Step 2 Constructive rephrasing:**

Now, articulate your thoughts and emotions with precision. It is important that you aim for precision. Learn new vocabulary if you need to. Suppose your feeling is captured by the thought ‘I feel like shit,’ mindfully label all the details and articulate it into something like ‘I feel ignored or judged because there is something wrong with me or I am dressed inappropriately.’

Add the emotional context- ‘I feel like an overwhelming spotlight is on top of me. This makes me conscious, self-aware, and critical.’

Once you’ve articulated your thoughts, it is time to rephrase them into something actionable. For example- I need to address this feeling and do something about it. Something that is in my control. Let me observe and see how others are dressed. Let me see if there is any real evidence of me being judged. I feel like I don’t know what to do, I should learn the skills.

This change is actionable. You can do something about it. This will help you **gain control**. You need it, and you \*are\* in control.

577,"I was hanging out at my friend's apartment last night. I was having a good time. My anxiety is getting a lot better and at that moment that night, I felt really peaceful and happy. My friend decided that that was a good time to start ""grilling"" me on everything I've done wrong in his eyes. He told me how I don't have a job, don't have a plan for life after college, don't do anything for myself, don't take charge of my life, that I have ""no empathy"" and that I ""can do better"". He said it in a way that was not empowering or friendly at all. He was basically telling me all the things I'm anxious about and then criticizing me for not facing them. He is a hypocrite because there are tons of things he isn't doing. He isn't perfect. Yet he thinks he can sit on his high horse and try to grill me about everything I'm anxious about. He assumed so many things about my life too. When I didn't agree with some of his assessments because, you know, he doesn't know shit about me, I suddenly ""wasn't listening"" and ""didn't want to accept the truth from anyone"". He told me that all my friends in our friend group hate me and that I'm not doing anything with my life.

&amp;#x200B;

This came out of nowhere from him and he went into things that weren't his business. I told him I didn't want to talk about it but he flat-out told me ""no"" and kept going. I eventually said I was going to leave if he didn't stop talking about it and he said ""fine"". I was really shocked by that because...don't you want to hang out with me? Don't you want me here because I'm your friend? Or do you just want to tell me things that you've convinced yourself about me and not listen to me? I felt too anxious to call him out on his own hypocrisies, so I just sat there and listened to him criticize me for 3 hours. It's one of those things where I realized how fucked up it is only a couple days after.

I originally chose the 'venting' flair for this post but once I saw the one that said 'needs a hug' it just hit my heart and I had to choose that one.

I don't know how to stop feeling this way. I feel so overwhelmed recently and I'm just sitting here crying as I type this. I can't even talk to anyone about how I'm feeling, even though I know they want to listen and help I just immediately feel so incredibly guilty for burdening them with my thoughts and problems that I just want to take back everything I just said. I feel so tense all the time, it takes me ages to fall asleep because I have constant worry that people I love are going to die. Especially my family, my boyfriend and my cats. Throughout the day and night I have these intrusive thoughts that something bad will happen to them, and I've developed a kind of superstition that I have to pray and pray and pray desperately or else the bad thing will happen. Some might say that prayer would help with this anxiety, but it's become an obsession, I'm not even very religious any more but my whole life praying has been the only way I felt like I had control over a scary situation so I guess I revert back to it. But I end up praying desperately and it sounds like begging - ""please please please please please Lord don't let anything happen please please"" and every night I have to run through a whole long prayer sequence praying specifically for every single person/animal that I'm worried about, including myself because I have constant anxiety that I'm going to die. It drives me crazy having this begging in my head all the time, 80% of my day is spent either worrying about my family or doing this desperate praying. To fall asleep at night I have to watch youtube videos, even if I'm exhausted I HAVE to have something to fall asleep to to take my mind off it.

I've been struggling to keep up with my university work too because of feeling constantly tense and stressed out and mentally exhausted from all the constant worrying and praying. I have an essay due tomorrow (and its 8pm here right now so I am going to be up all night) that I just haven't been able to do because my state of mind has just been terrible. The thought of not handing it in on time makes me feel 100 times more stress and is actually what just caused this panic attack I'm busy having. There is an extension procedure but I'm not sure if it's too late to apply, and since I don't have any documentation from a therapist backing up my reason they might not grant me the extension. I just don't know what to do. I should probably go attempt it now, even if I write it through my tears and do terribly at least I will be handing something in. Thanks to anyone who read this &lt;3

TLDR: Having really bad anxiety lately, mostly in the form of intrusive thoughts followed by obsessive praying.

583,"Ever since I was the passenger in a car accident on my birthday (February 22nd), my anxiety has flared up through the roof. It hasn't gotten that much better, though it's usually okay if I distract myself from it.

I get weird about my breathing, especially in public places like a classroom or movie theater. My vision is blurred nowadays from the lack of sleep, and my body is hyper sensitive to everything. I'm constantly fatigued, and I'm struggling to deal with everyday tasks.

Two nights ago I tried Diphenhydramine as a sleep aid, and it worked... But now last night it didn't work, even after taking a Benedryl with it like a pharmacist had suggested.

I'm not on any medication and hadn't been for years, but it just seems like things are spiraling out of control. I can't sleep for shit, much less want to be in a classroom. I used to enjoy sleep so much... I don't know why everything went to shit the way it did. It's been like this for weeks now. I'm debating on seeing a psych, but psychs have always made me nervous especially due to a previous Benzodiazepine addiction. At night my mind just races and paces along with my heart, and I can't even think properly like I used to. I could daydream and think about anything, but the brain fog has made everything uncertain.

I have an exam Wednesday I'm sure, and yet I can't even get out of bed to go turn in assignments in my damn Math 053 class. I've tried melatonin, blue light filters, strict bed time schedules... I just don't get why everything is going to shit or how to stop it. Depression is ruining any enjoyment of leisure activities I might have as well.

I still need to get a new therapist as well, as my last one left his position... Everything is just falling apart and I don't know how to pick up the pieces, or what to try. Or if I should even care anymore. My mom (I'm 27) just lays in bed all day and sleeps, and I'm here just struggling to eat food as my appetite continues to convince myself I'm hungry when I ate three meals a day.

So i have to go to work tomorrow. Nothin special right? I don't know really. At this time, thinking about it, i feel unease. To be more specific... I nearly have an anxiety attack in fear of having an anxiety attack tomorrow about having an anxiety attack so that my co-workers notice that i have anxiety attacks.

Yep, that's my life right now. pretty nonsensical isn't it? The point is, i guess i have to tell them. But telling someone not that close to me about such a thing is pretty hard. And there is the new chain. I, with social anxiety, have to tell a other person i will see the next at least 2 years about me having fucking anxiety. And there my depression plays in that mess. I am scared of tomorrow. of what tomorrow can happen... I'm sure falling asleep tonight is going to be hard. But i have to wake up early. It's clear that i will have a rough start in the day. It keeps building up. Even yet, my hands start getting sweaty just thinking and writing about my mess of a brain, mess of a person, mess of a life.

What else to say...? I already opened the bottle of vodka next to me. Mixed it with some soft drink of my choice... drank about 2 drinks at this point. To calm down. But as you can see, takes much more than 2 drinks, didn't even stopped shaking. Oh boy, i can tell you, my weekend wasn't really reassuring... That's about it. Thanks for reading my shit.

I had to meet in a part of the city that was very populated but that I’ve never been to before, with a total stranger but who had been contacted by a trusted person that works with her sometimes. That whole thing went so much better than expected, and I was glowing with confidence afterwards!

Second thing - I had to walk down to my local vets to ask if they can help me with a slight health problem my pet gecko was having. They couldn’t help me directly because they don’t specialise with exotics, but they gave me the contact details of a close exotic specialist vets that would be able to help me.

Finally, the third thing - similarly linked to the second thing - I ****called up**** that recommended specialist vets and got registered there with an appointment booked. Annoyingly, I’m going to have to rebook the time and day because I won’t actually be able to get there for then and I was put on the spot so I blurted out a time and date. However, it’ll be notice enough that it shouldn’t be a problem to rearrange, and the receptionist had told me that if I need to rearrange, to just call - so I’ll sort that out tomorrow.

Ughhhhh. I feel so drained from all these encounters, very tired emotionally, but I feel proud for pushing myself further than I have before, and getting things done. When I get anxious or stressed, I tend to procrastinate to hell and back so I can ignore my feelings (not the most effective solution), so forcing myself to do it sooner rather than later has been a relief to say the least.

600,"Hi. 
I'm not sure how common it is for other people, but I have been fainting several times a day over the past week. I have had this issue before, in times of great stress. (ie moving, car accident, loss/gain of employment, etc)

 Months ago, I had to leave work because I was extremely close to fainting and worried I was becoming bradycardic or having some other issue with my heart. I noticed that my heart rate went from low (53bpm was the lowest) to high (85 bpm) when I was usually around 60 - 65. My manager insisted that I went to the hospital or went home.

 My mom was near by so she picked me up and took me. They told me that there was nothing wrong with my heart but it was good that I came in since I took beta blockers for heart palpitations do to anxiety. I struggled for the next few weeks because I still felt faint. 

Then, only a couple months later my boyfriend was in a car accident. I wouldn't walk for 2-3 weeks. I was fainting again. I would sleep for 10+ hours a day for the first week. I went back to a doctor to make sure I was okay. They said i was medically fine. After about a month I was walking again, but had to work part time instead of full time. 

Now, we moved, I started a new medication and was laid off. I faint 3+ times a day if I do anything that remotely causes anxiety. So if I need to leave the house, you can bet that I'm going to faint. I'm sure you can imagine why this makes life difficult. Has anyone else experienced this? If so, is there anything that can help with it? Sorry for the long post.",1
601,"Great news, I think I stopped having sudden anxiety attacks when suddenly thinking about death. Thank you all for advice to preoccupy myself so I don't think about it too much. But now it's paranoia. Hypochondriac? 

My chest hurts for no reason. ""I must have a heart disease"" 
My body's feeling weird ""is it a chronic illness?""
But mostly it's my chest. 

I don't know if it's anxiety or stress or a chronic illness, my chest(left side)  hurts and aches randomly. Mostly before sleeping and I feel like there's something wrong with me? 

I still think I have a chronic illness, it's just at random and less painful? It still makes me break in sweat and afraid to sleep thinking I won't ever open my eyes again. 

I don't smoke, I don't have a high blood pressure(not that I know) there's no possible reason why I would have a heart disease. Except stress? There's exams now but the school doesnt stop the after school activities. Doesn't help that I have an important biannual competition coming up.

I always thought of myself as a jovial person. But last February alone, I've had the most number of mental breakdowns than EVER. To give you an idea, my best friends of three years were shocked when I mentioned that i easily cry when i get emotionally overhwelmed.

This year was the first time ever I revealed problems with friends at school and broke down in front of my family. And I've been in the school dealing with it for 2 years. 

Should I talk to a councillor？I feel reddit is the only place I can talk about this freely. 

And I feel hesitant to talk to the counselor, I'm not that bold and I don't know how to bring this topic up since i've never talked to someone about this as openly on reddit. Also stupid me might get emotionally overhwlemed and break down in front of her. 

Tldr: unsure if stress is causing chest aches which triggered health paranoia. Amounting stress at school makes want to consult a counselor

So I end up ordering food online, and just collecting the trash in the room. Then, when it's time to leave, I don't know what to do.

A couple of years ago when I was in that situation, I went to a random apartment complex and dumped my trash in their trash. This year though, I am staying in a neighbourhood with houses. Last week, I used a public trash bin but it's so small. Now I have so much trash in my room (all in bags, so no smell and no mess) and I'm leaving tomorrow. I'm like on the verge of panicking. Add to that the fact that the host scares the crap out of me. I need a plan to throw everything away. I think I might go to a public park and just dump a little trash in all the bins once the sun is down. 

It's ridiculous y'all. ",1
604,"So today I had one of the worst episodes of anxiety I’ve had for almost 2 years, and I don’t know why. 

It seems like every time I’ve needed to leave my house over the last few days my anxiety sky rockets, sweaty palms, nausea and just a general sense of anxiety and not being able to breathe. 

I’m due to start a new job, which is also a university course in May. I didn’t think I was anxious about this, but maybe it’s what set it off? 

I was supposed to be spending the day with my boyfriend in the town about 20 minutes away, but as soon as I got to the bus stop I had to come home. He came to my house to sit with me and calm me down, which helped massively, and encouraged me to get onto the bus with him. I managed to, but as soon as I got into his town I got super anxious again, nausea, shaking,  dizziness and couldn’t breathe. We stopped in a pub near the bus stop where I called my mum (my saviour) and I decided I needed to go home. 

I can’t thank my boyfriend enough for what he does for me, and today was the first time he’s seen my anxiety this bad. 

I really really don’t want it to get so bad that it reaches the point I can’t leave my house without feeling like this. It’s tiring, and I want to be able to live my life. I like going out, and I like being able to feel happy and content while I’m out. 

If anyone feels like this, please give me some helpful pointers or just encouragement. God knows I need some today. 

Thank you:) ",1
605,"I am sorry if this is the wrong place, but I just needed to put my thoughts down someplace- I am at work, but not wanting to do this with coworkers

A month ago, I learned that my dear son was making suicidal gestures with a rifle.  He had done so in the past including a few times with a loaded rifle.  The last time he did so, he was online with a friend, the rifle was not loaded, but the friend reached out to her mom, then guidance counselor, and then we found out through the school.

Since then, he has been in intensive inpatient therapy, and now is in outpatient therapy.  He is doing well, scaling his days on a better than fair scale.  He says he feels better and behaviorally he is far more engaged with friends and family.  All guns, rifle and ammo were removed and are stored offsite and he does not know where.

Things were moving along fine until about a half hour ago.  I was driving to work and I got images of coming into his room and finding that he had shot himself.  I don't have any specific images, just seeing his body, and blood and the gun.  It is almost as if the enormity of how close we came to losing him, and how oblivious we were to how close we were, is starting to hit me.  This came out of the blue.  I am literally sitting here, typing at work with tears running down my face.

We are also in family therapy- group therapy and all sorts of professional support.  For his sake, we have chosen to not disclose to immediate family as it would also trigger too much drama and interference at this point.

I just have to put this thought here.  And I am going to murder this thought.  I am killing this awful bloody thought.  I am eliminating it from my mind, as much as I can and will not allow it to have a moment further energy.  It didn't happen.  We found out in time.  He is still alive, and he is fighting to survive, and I will him to survive as much as I can.

This is me facing the anxiety, letting the full fear come on, and destroying the thought and replacing with a victory.  Not sure if this will work.

606,"We live in a two bedroom apartment - me, my partner, and his 18 year old son.

It's not my mom actually moving in that has me stressed, it's all the things I suddenly have to do in the next few weeks. We're giving her our bedroom, so we have to relocate our stuff to the living room. This is obviously going to require putting a lot of items in storage and, well , putting our privacy in storage, too.

The amount of work we're going to have to do in the next few weeks has already given me two panic attacks - and I found out yesterday. Plus, I'm stressed because she's obviously stressed and probably embarrassed.

I honestly don't want to get into the details - just wanted to get my feelings out somehow. I love my mom and her living with us isn't going to be a problem - it's the actual preparation and the small window we have to do it in. And, well, how long it could possibly last. She needs back surgery, and it's hard to get a new job at 56.",1
607,"I don't want to get too into the details (although if you look at my past comments I did kind of a big vent this morning on a different thread) but I need to get to an AlAnon meeting. I've needed to for a long time, actually. Maybe a year ago I looked up meetings near me, found one that was a convenient location/time, put it in my calendar, and then didn't go. It was way easier to not go and pretend I didn't really need to, than to deal with the anxiety of a) getting myself there (showing up is a really hard thing for me when I'm feeling anxious), b) what would actually happen in the meeting, and c) what would be the consequences of having gone.

I found a meeting this upcoming Saturday morning that I could walk to from where I live. I'd really like to go, but I'm definitely anxious about having never been before and not knowing what to expect. I'm hoping that if I can hear insights from people who have gone, it'll make me feel a little braver about actually going.

Also, this is no one's responsibility here, but I could use some accountability if anyone wants to help keep me honest about going to this. My IRL support systems are kind of all absent right now.",1
608,"Hey all! 

So I’ve had lifelong anxiety, got much better for a while without medication (not fully but no panic attacks for like 3-4 years except for rarely) and now in the past 6 months got worse again. I went to the doctor and was prescribed Lexapro 10mg which I have been taking for around 4 months now. I also have Xanax as needed. 

My question is about my boyfriend. We have been together for a couple years, and when we first met and for the first year of our relationship I was still in my “lower anxiety” phase. But then in October / November of 2018 I started having daily panic attacks again  and derealization / depersonalization again. After taking the lexapro, it has gotten better but is still pretty bad. And I can tell my boyfriend is pretty upset about it. He hasn’t ever liked it but when it first started happening he was more empathetic and trying to be understanding and worried for me. Now that it has gone on for so long I can tell he’s getting upset at me. He knows it’s something that is extremely hard for me to control, but he said to me today “I just want happy times” and when I asked him to clarify he said it just seems like I can’t ever enjoy anything because of my anxiety (which is true and literally one of my fears— that I will be so scared to live that I wont). 

For example, yesterday was really hard for me but I pushed myself and we went out to a little festival and rode those electric scooters. I really didn’t want to go because of my anxiety, but super glad I went because it was fun and I pushed through! However today, for him he brought up How anxious I was and how I wanted to leave like 20 minutes into us being there. Which I had told him I was feeling anxious and wanting to leave but that I didn’t actually want to and wanted to push through, the wanting to leave was just my anxiety. But based on what he said, he didn’t have as much fun as I did and actually I held him back from having as much fun as he could have. And over time I have seen how I do that because of my anxiety. Even a trip to the mall can sometimes be a hassle because I’m freaking out inside (but I’ll tell him).

So I’m just feeling super down and not sure what to do because I know my anxiety is pushing my boyfriend away but I can’t just get rid of it... although I want it to be gone and I’m trying. What can I do to make him happier? Should I refrain from telling him about my anxiety anymore? And just try to keep it to myself? I don’t want to hold him back from living his life and enjoying it to its fullest especially since he doesn’t have anxiety but I want to also experience things with him i just have such a hard time. I don’t know what to do. My anxiety makes me feel so selfish. Any suggestions / tips? ",1

“This is the worst that my anxiety has been in a long time, and it’s really hard to talk about because I don’t want to feel like I’m a bother or constantly being negative.

My work event was over and I rush back to, sadly, clean up the room and basically put everything I own back into a suitcase. As a bonus, I’m also not feeling great and I really didn’t want to go sit somewhere else for 20 minutes after finally taking my shoes off. 

The maid showed up, made a bed, took towels and left me some chocolate.... all while I typed away on my laptop. Took her like 8 minutes. I thought it was going to be a level 7 awkward situation but it was only like a 2.5. I only apologized for having my stuff in her way twice!

621,"I had an anxiety attack tonight for the first time in over a year...which in itself is an accomplishment! However, the attack made me realized how stressful some pretty significant things in my life are right now. 

To start, I’m a teacher in one of the worst possible states to be a teacher, Arizona. I hate my administration but a job is a job and I’m working without one of the certifications I really should have through a loophole in the system. I don’t have the certification because I have terrible test anxiety (shocker) and keep failing it. I have plans to keep trying until it is passed but it costs $95 each try.

Next, my hobby is expensive. I own a horse. While I do so in the cheapest way possible, it is a terrible hobby to have with such a low paying job. Without the horse, I’d be pretty lost mentally. I normally have him partially leased out to help with costs but I’ve been unable to find a lessor and It’s been over a year without one...

Lastly, I am having trouble finding a roommate. I had to get out of a bad living situation in a very short period of time and the only place that I found to go where I would feel safe was a few hundred dollars out of my price range. I had a roommate which was helpful but she relocated to a different state for school. Since my rental rate is high the rate to rent my spare room has to reflect that and I know that that is what is keeping people away.

I really should have a second job, as most of my coworkers do. Some work their second job on weekends and others work an entire shift after school somewhere but I just can’t bring myself to do that as I’d have virtual zero down time which I know I need to help stay both physically and mentally healthy.",1
622,"TW: domestic abuse

I have struggled with anxiety since I was in 4th grade. I caught myself crying over the silliest of things, all the time. It has only gotten worse.

It got really bad when I dated this guy for 5 years. Everything was going great for the first half of our relationship - we were that picture-perfect couple that everyone wanted to be. To keep a long story short, we had a falling out and broke up. We talked everything through months later and decided to get back together. I thought everything would be fine. 

I was dead wrong. 

He started physically abusing me. He started calling me every name in the book. He told me that he was the only person that would ever love me - he convinced me that my mother, my father, my sister, my brothers...all hated me, and it was an “obligation” to treat me right because I’m part of the family and it would be “f**cked up” to blatantly tell me that they didn’t love me. I was fully convinced. And I guess I just haven’t been able to shake it yet. He left me shortly after our 5 year anniversary. 

Now, I am not saying that he is the reason I have anxiety - I was diagnosed with it for far more reasons than this. This just made it that much worse. 

I am now in a relationship of 3 months with this wonderful guy that takes awesome care of me. I couldn’t have asked for anyone better. But I catch myself, almost every night, not being able to sleep from anxiety. Anxiety of him leaving. Anxiety that he just doesn’t love me anymore and questioning who would even love me to begin with. I have talked to him about it once or twice and he has reassured me that I have nothing to worry about, and that he loves me - but I still can’t shake it. I shake, I get nauseous, and I get that lump in my throat that tells me to cry but I can’t. So I just stare at the ceiling and hope it passes. 

I have two best friends that I wouldn’t trade for the world, and I am even convinced that they don’t like being around me anymore. I’ve isolated myself, I’ve stopped answering phone calls from them, I’ve bailed on them. I feel like an awful friend, but I feel like I seriously just can’t freaking help it. I’ve mentioned it to them and they’ve also reassured me that I have nothing to worry about, but it’s like there’s a devil on my shoulder telling me that they’re lying. 

I don’t know how much longer I can keep feeling this way. I need help. I’m struggling.

624,"A cowardly dog is trapped in the corner… all it's life it's been beaten and the only reason it survived was by running away, hiding and whimpering. But now it's cornered, for the first time it can't escape… it now has no choice but to fight viciously for survival. This illustrates the desperate way that our damaged subconscious mind tries to hold on to power and control over us in an attempt to “protect” us and keep us “safe” from harm.
In our childhood the only choice we had was to run, hide or cower in fear. Now, as an adult we have dug deep into the depths of our psyche and we now understand our dysfunction… however, our minds still do not trust us to take control of matters that involve our emotional safety… as a result, it attacks us with convincing arguments that if we try we will fail, there's no point in trying, fighting back leads to pain, give up, run, hide, cower… our minds fill us with fear, dread, anxiety and depression… every and any debilitating emotion to stop us from doing what it feels is dangerous. That is, to confront our fears and try new healthier ways to cope and live. But now our subconscious mind is cornered, there's no way out… you have chosen to refuse to give up, it's you and the cornered animal and only one of you will survive. The problem is, that YOU are the cornered animal, and the only way you walk out is by taming the beast, domesticating it, letting it know that you are in control, letting it know that you are grateful for it keeping you safe the only way it knew how for so many years. But now, YOU are in control and you need to let your mind know that you will protect it now, and that you will not let bad things happen to it again.

Recovery vs Fear of the Unknown 

For those of us with any sort of childhood trauma, fear of the unknown is debilitating. Our childhood trauma taught us that certainty within any given situation is the most important thing. For us, uncertainty was seen as certainty that bad things would happen. Therefore in our lives today, as bad as depression and anxiety is, we are familiar with it… and trying something new,  or trying to do things differently  may fill us with more fear and apprehension, which in turn keeps us trapped in our familiar prison of depression and anxiety.

For me, this is a basic outline of my history.

Initial childhood trauma lasting 18 years.

Maladapted coping mechanisms formed:

•	Denial
•	Suppression
•	Distraction
•	Subjugation
•	Enmeshment
•	Underdeveloped sense of self 
•	People pleasing 
•	Approval Seeking
•	Validation seeking
•	Substance abuse
•	Self pity

After the initial trauma lasting 18 years, it was followed by over 20 years of living a false, people pleasing, codependent identity which ultimately culminated extreme and debilitating depression and anxiety.
For me, recovery meant:

Making a start at refusing to deny, suppress and distract myself from the fact that I have a problem.

Making a start at refusing to be subjugated, people please, approval seek or validation seek.

Making a start at giving myself praise, validation and approval.

My maladapted coping mechanisms of people pleasing, co-dependency, approval and validation seeking all gave me a measure of pleasure and good endorphin release, albeit disfunctionally... therefore, as I started to eliminate maladapted coping mechanisms I started to experience less positive feelings and more stabilized and constant feelings of depression.

Understanding and Acceptance

Once you understand, in as much detail as possible, the precise links between your childhood trauma and your current behaviour and feelings, you might be lucky enough to transform your feelings of depression, anxiety and sadness into anger against the injustice of life itself... anger is a not to be underestimated important step to reach because it is a necessary driver of change... but even then you will not automatically experience joy, peace, calm and happiness... in fact, this type of appropriate anger can and will lead to cynicism, bitterness and resentment, and so it is important to move to the next step in your recovery which is acceptance.

Acceptance.

Acceptance of what happened in your childhood, acceptance of how those things made you who you are today, acceptance that you were and are not to blame for any of it, acceptance that you cannot change the past, acceptance that you are who you are in the now, acceptance that in the now you are the best version of you that you can be... acceptance of the fact that you now have determination to slowly improve your person and your life in frustratingly small steps, every day, day by day, week by week, month by month, year by year... acceptance of the resolve to not give up come what may.

The thing is, most likely, your mind does not know how to feel safe, positive and happy in a normal way. At a default subconscious level your mind will want to revert back to denial, suppression, distraction, a desire to find meaning through enmeshment, self pity and substance abuse or another well established self destructive behaviours. The sad fact is, is that your mind does not yet know how to cope or exist in any other state other than sadness, depression and maladapted and dysfunctional ways of coping and feeling better about things. Therefore it is important to teach your mind new ways to cope with feelings of negativity and new and healthier ways to experience joy, pleasure and happiness... this will present a real challenge for you, because even on a conscious level, you may simply not know how. Initially, you may simply have to go through the mechanical motions of doing things that you know are suppose to make you feel better... like going for walk, doing something artistic, outdoor activities, social activities, listening to music that is happy, not jaded or angry music, or depressing love songs etc.

At times however, we may need to go back and feel the fullness of our pain so as to explore and learn from it, to heal it through resolution... but we cannot live in a state of pain. We may need to revisit feeling angry over the injustices of our life, but we cannot live angry... 

So balance is required, because although we want to live in a happy headspace, this does not mean slipping into denial, suppression and distraction.... it means that we have felt the fullness of our sadness and anger... we accept what we feel, we acknowledge our past and with that acceptance and acknowledgement, we now choose to engage in positive activities to teach ourselves how to be happy in a healthy way.

This being said, the first stage to reach from depression and anxiety is anger, because you are making the switch from flight to fight, but you don't want to stay angry or you will be consumed by cynicism, bitterness and resentment... so you need to move on to the next stage which is resolute acceptance... 

After that you need to establish a new set of personal boundaries, or a realm, or scope of life that you want establish to live within... to find joy within... to find personal fulfilment and meaning and purpose within. Establishing a new life within which you want to live.

Acceptance is important, but it is important to know and get well acquainted with and pursue the healthy things that you want and enjoy in life, that will help you to cope and recover further. 

An important thing to remember is that recovery will not mean that your life will ever be as though your childhood trauma never happened... it will never be how it was before you were debilitated by anxiety and depression... however, just because this may be the case, it does not mean that whatever life you choose to create won't be wonderful.

For me that means pursuing things like art, exercise, weight loss, happy music, lego, movies, gaming, fishing, camping, creativity, appropriate self love and self respect through proper personal hygiene, care, grooming, dress and helping others to better their lives purely for the joy of giving without falling back into co-dependent or people pleasing patterns.

At this stage you may question why? Why bother? You may fear that doing or pursuing these things is ultimately pointless and little more than distracting yourself with positivity. This may be true to a degree, but not entirely, and you will need to be able to recognize that your resistance to pursuing these things amounts predominantly to your own deep seated fear of failure when you try to effect change for the better... your mind may still be trying to hang on to the familiarity of depression and anxiety because it knows how to disfunctionally make you feel better and will always try to pull you back to familiar things to your own detriment because it is convinced that you will be better of with the dysfunction you know, than the uncertainty of doing something new that might fail.

Regret nothing, feel ashamed over nothing, feel guilty over nothing, the past has made you the good and insightful and thoughtful and compassionate person that you are. To regret, feel shame or guilt is to regret that you are who you are, to feel shame and guilt over who you are... which is little more than self hate. Life did not give you the love, nurturing and protection that you deserved... so accept that you are who you are due to a life that was not of your planning and control and was ultimately indifferent, random and cruel.

Armed with this acceptance, move forward and choose to be who you want to be... choose to do what you want to do... choose to live how you want to live... refuse to go on allowing life to happen to you... take charge and become the architect of your future... even if it's hard... even if it's scarey... even though it's unclear whether you will fail or succeed.

628,"Okay first of all I'm on mobile so the format's gonna be a little weird, and I apologise in advance for any typos. 

I've had anxiety for a while and I've never really done anything to deal with it because I'm too busy with extracurriculars and school. I also didn't tell my parents until recently because they both have a lot of difficulty understanding anxiety and stuff. I told them that I'd been having more  anxiety attacks than normal recently and that I'd been shaking a bunch and it was impacting my school work and stuff (bc I apparently think that's more important than my health). 

My mom thought it was bc I wasn't drinking enough milk and my dad yelled at me for being on my phone too much and giving myself anxiety (which isn't true). 

My parents are both super traditional Indian parents and my older brother is super successful like he's going to graduate college in 2 months and has a nice job lined up and blah blah blah so there's a ton of pressure on me. I think that my parents cause some of my anxiety. Should I tell them this? If so, how do I tell 2 people who don't understand stuff like this that they're causing some of my anxiety? 

To clarify, my mom and dad think that if I tell them everything about myself, my anxiety will go away. Also, when one of my friends almost committed suicide a a few years ago, their only reaction was to ask me why someone would do something that stupid (when they didn't know my friend's circumstances at all). They just don't understand this stuff at all and I really don't know what to do and being at home is stressful and it's basically one long anxiety attack. 

If anyone has any advice that would be amazing, thanks.",1
629,"Just started my second office style job and I've noticed I'm repeating certain behaviours.

""If you are in work, you should work"". This seems to be the best way I've come up with summarising my issue. Everytime I've worked in an office for enviroement I become lazer focused on completing tasks and neglecting everything else. This includes eating, toilet breaks, talking to coworkers, grabbing water. As a result I get in, work, and get out. This probably isn't healthy (physically or mentally), socially I'm isolating myself already, and it's probably also a less effective way to work.

This mindset doesn't just apply to me though. If I see others not actively working on something I become angry, resentful, jealous, ect.

I didn't do anything about obsession with being valuable to my employer before and it resulted me in having referring to a seating plan to see the names of people who were in arm's reach, and overworking myself to the point of getting myself fired.

Ok so this is going to be a long post

I'm a 20 year old Male and I have bad anxiety 
Let's start from the beginning all through my school and college years I have had really bad social anxiety and didnt even realise until it was too late and now I have no one. When I was at college I would be so self conscious when I was doing my work I would never ask for help and would always turn the screen brightness down and angle my laptop so no one could see what I was doing even though I knew no one was watching and when someone was watching i would just completely stop working until they were gone. 
I hate talking about my self and my emotions in fact i hate talking to anyone about anything because i always overthink it and end up saying nothing and not contributing to a conversation. This is often misleading to most people who dont understand me as they just think I'm not interested and have nothing to say when really I have so much to say but by the time I finished going over it in my head it's too late and everyone has moved on. This makes every interaction really awkward especially if it's only me and one other person .
There are a few friends that I feel more comfortable around and will at least engage in a conversation with them however lately most of these people have moved on. So now how am I supposed to meet new people when the few people i feel comfortable around no longer bother with me.
I have only ever discussed my anxiety with one person and only talked about it because he bought it up its like no one else even knows I have anxiety which makes it even more uncomfortable for me.

Lately I've been trying to reach out more but everyone seems to always be busy and I dont want to sound to pushy or desperate so I usually just leave it. I will start typing a message to someone but won't actually send it because I overthink it and even when I am sending a message reaching out to someone I will be going over every word so many times even to the point where one word wont sound right in my head then I will Google the word to make sure it's right even tho I known the whole time  it's right. And it doesn't stop there even after I have sent a message or said something to someone I will be thinking it over in my head. 

After I post this I'm going to be going over it in my head for so long even though I know that it doesn't matter and that no one reading this will care

There is so much more I need to talk about but at the moment its 5am and I need to get some sleep

640,"I am currently on the tail end of my sophomore year of college, my anxiety is still present in my daily life, some days worse than others, but I can manage now. Last year in group therapy, around this time, I gave myself goals that I wanted to achieve. Two of the goals were to get my license, (my anxiety kept me from driving, I felt like I was going to die every time I got behind the wheel) and try to repair my relationship with my parents after I came out to them. One year later and I am comfortably licensed to drive and things are slowly getting better with my parents. I know these seem kinda lame, but I never, ever thought I would be able to do these things. The more coping skills I learn, I feel less and less terrified of the world. Can’t wait to see what next year will bring.",1

These things happen and I get so nervous and scared of everything, my mind races but I’m unable to think straight, blaming myself for every little thing even if it isn’t in my control. In my “panic attacks” I start shaking and I feel like I can’t breathe, in those moments I lose control and I want it to stop. I call it anxiety but I don’t want to be inconsiderate to those who deal with the real deal if I don’t actually have anxiety disorder. ",1

I have never really dealt with this before. I just felt so overwhelmed with my new class, the pressure to find a summer internship, my relationship, and just knowing how unhappy I feel at school sometimes just all came crashing onto me I guess. I couldn't stop crying while ft my boyfriend and even today was hard, I was struggling to hold back tears from just everything I guess.

645,"I fought my anxiety and won (mostly)

Now the present is enough.

At home with nothing to do? I can cook a meal with just me and the ingredients. Podcast is optional.

This life is a pleasure cruise. These clouds and trees and people are more than I could ask for.

Without anxiety, I’m free.

647,"Okay so, I've been taking 5mg of Buspirone for 6 months and recently (2 weeks ago) upped my dose to 10mg. I upped it because I was still experiencing panic attacks out of the blue.

I’m 18 (female) and have never been kissed or had sex. I had a boyfriend in middle school but I never did anything with him and we didn’t spend any time together and eventually broke up. I haven’t dated anyone since. I don’t think I’m ugly or boring but I’m definitely not perfect.

I really want a boyfriend, to have my first kiss and lose my virginity, etc. So I can get over the fear that I’ll be a virgin and alone forever. I feel so stupid to worry about these things but all I can think about these days are how I’ll probably be alone forever.

I got a few dating apps but I got stood up on the first time I agreed to meet with someone which really screwed my self confidence up. I also hate eating around others in fear of looking gross. I went on another date and when he tried to kiss me, I chickened out because he was older than me and I’m also worried that I will be bad at kissing. The next date I went on I thought went okay, but he stopped texting me. I still have tinder and chat with people occasionally but am too afraid to meet up.

I honestly have no idea what to do about this. I feel really stressed about this. please give suggestions on ways to move on from these worries.",1
650,"I’ve been in a rut with severe depression and anxiety for the past decade, which is nuts considering I’m 17. I’ve tried all the regular methods, meditation, working out, trying a ton of new thing etc etc etc. Basically everything but intimate relationships or sex because of a shitty feedback loop where I don’t try because of anxiety and self loathing, and have the anxiety and self loathing surrounding it because of my inexperience. 

So I’ve tried resorting to substances recently. Not the best choice I know, but i don’t know what else to do. By this point I’ve used plenty of stims, not a lot of benzos, alcohol, and I have a nicotine addiction. Of course like any teenager, I’ve tried weed a lot before. My first time I think was in 8th grade with my first stoner friend, felt tingly and happy for a lil bit and went on my merry way. 

In the past 2 years though, weed seems to mess with me a lot more than anything else has. It’s been a gradual change but I don’t use it enough to see any actual data like that. But anyways I’m gonna try to explain my recent experiences as well as I can. Note that it might be dramatic, acting like I was experiencing some Aztec ritual type shit, but I really am explaining it as truthfully and as well as I can:

So it starts out right after I take a hit. The top of my mouth and tongue start to go to a tingly numb. Over the next 30 minutes this feeling consumes my whole body. Meanwhile, my mind starts slowly racing, I overthink heavily each action and thought I have to the microscopic level to the point that I’m metacognating on my metacognition each second. It’s still fine, I think it’s fun. My thoughts are now synced to a beat, if I’m listening to music it goes along with the beat, if not I have some weird ambient sounds in my head that I have no idea where they come from. Still all good.

Then it gets bad. The beat isn’t only in my thoughts, I’m having twitches and my shoulders or torso jerk with every other beat. Then I start to get an intense feeling creeping towards my spine and I start to go cross eyed. I start thinking about the last time this happened but I block it out, this time will be good and fun. But it doesn’t take long to submit that I’m not  feeling good anymore. 

Then my thoughts go out of control. I start to think about *everything.* and really, *everything.* I uncover old memories from my early childhood up to now, bouncing around back and fourth. But I can’t actually tell you what those memories entail, maybe they pass to quickly, or maybe they aren’t even real.!The real kick is though that each quarter second memory has a specific unrelated visual in my head and an emotion tied to it, the emotion I guess is the one tying them together. I can’t explain the emotion for the same reason I can’t explain the memory. But it gets super intense. Some are happy, some are sad, some are scary or dreadful. Basically every feeling in the book. It can get dark, one thought that stuck out to me was that I was just meant to kill myself from the start, like a prophesy was made for me, and less than a second later I knew I was destined to be a legendary guitarist.

Then that intense feeling I mentioned before starts to get a lot more intense. And it’s now rushing through both my spine and my brain, and eventually all of my nerves. It gets more and more tingly until it starts to just feel really painful. Like an overload of adrenaline or dopamine. But I have no idea what it is. 

About an hour and a half in both start to max out and I either throw up or power through it and fall asleep. 

And then that’s it.

Again like I said, super dramatic, but it’s the best I can explain it without leaving anything I can think of out. This doesn’t happen every time either. And it’s not correlating to the amount I use. So that just adds to the confusion.

I really don’t do it often, but every time I do I’ve gotten a growing sense of paranoia and abnormality. I’ve never seen or heard of anyone having these experiences. I don’t feel like my brain is functioning correctly. I want to try more psychedelics like lsd and psilocybin, but after these it’s made me wary. 

What is this? What do I do?",1

659,"-this is my first reddit post it’s probably terrible-
When i can tell anxiety is anxiety i can ignore it (like if i’m scared to go to the first day of class) but sometimes when the anxiety comes from a very real danger it’s hard for me to tell if it’s anxiety or a bad feeling i should listen to. This happens to me every time i want to go to the gym at night, i keep thinking someone is going to take me in the parking lot or something and i mean that could easily happen so it’s hard for me to tell if it’s a “warning feeling” or anxiety. I think it’s important to pay attention to your intuition if you have a bad feeling about something BUT i keep listening to my anxiety because i’m scared it’s my intuition. 
I’m pretty sure it’s just anxiety because it happens every time i want to go to the gym at night and when i do go i don’t get taken but i keep thinking “what if THIS time i should listen to it bc it’s real?”

As I went up in front of the class to present my powerpoint, I began shaking profusely. I started sweating and my voice got shaky. I knew they could tell I was nervous from how they were looking at me. They were looking at me like I was crazy.

When I finished, they appluaded nonetheless. A few students had to do a peer review for each student that presented. One person did a peer review for me. For each student you had to write something they needed to improve on.

For my improvement, she wrote ""Relax a little bit."" That kind of hurt me because she noticed I was nervous.

I wish I could be like one of those people that faces change head on and without fear. I'm so so so scared to move forward.",1
673,"Recently I feel as if anxiety has been beating to a pulp. I had a panic attack Wednesday before last and ever since then there’s been a lot of physical symptoms. 

The main and most common ones are shortness of breath (which is pretty much 25/7) and fast heart rate. 

I also get nausea, hot flushes, lightheadedness, panic, worst case scenario thoughts etc.

I’ve came home early from college twice this week cause of it, which pisses me off as my attendance is pretty much impeccable. 

Been to the doctor and had blood tests, waiting for them to come back, also going to the doctor this Wednesday for the shortness of breath. 

I know deep down there’s probably nothing wrong with me, but anxiety stresses me out. 

I do distract myself and drink lots of water which I find helps .

Unfortunately in the last few years my drinking and stimulant became worse and was detrimental to my mental and physical health.

I'm doing fine now as far as that is concerned. Attended therapy, clean and sober since November last year.

When I came back I heard a few of my ""friends"" use the following phrase,

""we'll just use up what's left of him and then throw the rest away""

I've never heard this before. I've always been a people pleasing personality type and I'm struggling hard to determine how to interpret it.

Maybe I just don't want to face facts that it means exactly what it says... That by hanging around with these people I put myself in a weak position and they aren't real friends at all.

I want to tell them about it all but it's just so personal. I'm sure they would understand, but there are several reasons why I haven't told them.

To start, this anxiety and all as been so beyond intense I don't know if they would understand. They're all living in a different world than me, because life hasn't beat the crap out of them yet. It's also very personal, and although were somewhat close it is still embarrassing nonetheless. Third, I don't want them to feel burdened by my problems.

681,"Hi guys,

I have been struggling with a fear of Schizophrenia for the past few weeks and today I noticed feeling multiple sensations around my body. Some of these sensations feel like tingling, itching, stress going through my back and on the occasion, bugs crawling through my skin (this lasts for a few seconds). I have been doing a lot of reading about Schizophrenia, and I read about the tactile hallucinations and now I am wondering if I am having it.  

I had the Bach's Rescue Therapy pastille as well as two tablets of NuLife Theraputics Sunshine Therapy (it contains items such as Vitamin D, St Johns Wort, Vitamin B3 and B6 and others). I was wondering if taking these tablets triggered  or could trigger the onset of Schizophrenia. I have also been taking Vitamin D (1 tablet), Omega 3 for the past week daily. At the same time, I have to wonder if this is my anxiety causing symptoms, or my use of the tablets causing symptoms. I am just very worried, and at the same time I am not hearing voices or seeing things that are not there.",1
682,"Hi everyone! So...I’m trying to write this as coherently as I can, and I hope it all makes sense lol. They’re all undiagnosed, but I know I have generalized/social anxiety and OCD. My mind constantly runs amok, and I fear the worst will happen, to the point of exhaustion, especially about things like social interactions, even just run of the mill stuff. My body is always so tense, my heart rate is always so fast, I’m tired so often, and I’m taking nexium everyday for heartburn. Also, I think my hair is falling out more often than usual, which is an indication of severe anxiety, I think. Overall, I just feel very stuck, like everything seems so hard. 

I’m a college senior set to graduate in a few months, and I just...haven’t been looking for jobs or internships or anything because the prospect of interviews really scares me, like I can foresee me messing up horribly. Over winter break, my parents started nudging me along in regards to potential jobs/internships, like suggesting I apply for this and that, and I would kind of start to avoid them because all that just scares me. They then told me they didn’t understand why I was so resistant to talking about after college stuff, so I kind of broke down and told them that I’m afraid of interviews and working with people! I told them I get so anxious about things, and sometimes I feel very sad about how anxious I get. And they seemed to understand. My mom said “Well, maybe you need to talk to someone”, like therapy. The concept of therapy kinda scares me, but I know it would make me feel better. My dad was really sympathetic and said that it’s okay that I don’t know what to do in regards to after college stuff, and that I’ll figure it out. All in all, at the end of winter break, I felt better because I told them about how I was feeling. I guess I had this idea that after graduation, I could go to therapy and figure things out from there. We didn’t really talk about me having anxiety though after that; I think we just didn’t want to address it? Idk

But then I came home for spring break and my mom starts asking me about jobs and stuff. I was taken off guard and said “oh I thought we said I could talk to someone first...” and she said something like “is it really that bad? I get anxious too. Everyone gets stressed out sometimes.” My mom has always been saying stuff like that when I try to bring up anxiety—that everyone gets nervous, it’ll pass. She attributes my bad anxiety and heartburn to me working on my senior thesis, and that when I’m done with it, I’ll feel better. Sure, thesis writing has exacerbated my anxiety, but it’s by no means the only cause. I just don’t know how to make them understand that I have a disorder. I’m also kind of ashamed that I have bad anxiety, that it ruins relationships for me, and that I’m really lonely sometimes because of it. Overall, it’s really frustrating, and I just feel so stuck. 

My parents are the best parents in the world, and I’m grateful that they want to help me in regards to after school plans. I also realize that their alarm towards me not actively looking for jobs is more that justifiable. I just wish I could make them understand easier. Sorry this is so long, but this is really the first time I’ve went in depth with how I’ve been feeling. Any advice is much appreciated. ",1

The plan was to solve it on the scrap paper and hand it back in with my test.

687,"TL;DR ""What are the preparations you take when your engaged to face a major exposure excersize?""

Hiya!

Next week I got a major exposure 'event'.
In an earlier post I mentioned my dad is having pancreas surgery out of town. 
(1 hour drive from home) 
My mother, sister + husband, and I are going to be around him for support. 
We booked an hotel room for 2 nights. 
I'm extremely nervous and full of anxiety. Already. 

Because the surgery is not a choice, my presence neither is. 
This is a thing I have to do, an exposure I can't escape. 
My fears aren't really about the surgery, because the surgeon is very capable, he is going to use a newtech robot assistance and the tumor they are going to remove hasn't proven to be cancer for 100% certainty. (My dad did have three surgeries before. All of them removing cancer tumors. Those were in his colon and two times liver, so luckily they aren't taking any risks on the development of this found spot on his pancreas)
I'm more afraid of being out of my comfort zone, outdoors, visiting the hospital, feeling claustrophobic, or afraid I have to vomit and can't find a toilet nearby. It's about sleeping in a hotel, or getting myself into panic attacks, and not being able to calm down. Or the fear no one can calm me down, and that I remain in the panic attack and it will drive me out of control. Get into a mindset of despair and hopelessness. 

And being afraid of being the extra emotional weight my family has to carry around while we're already at the top of emotional tolerance...

So! I need to prepare myself as good as possible!
Does anyone have any tips regarding preparation for exposures? 
- I'm gonna try to be rested and relaxed as possible this week. So that my body can handle the adrenaline. 
- I'm going to exercise a bit. Don't have a any condition, won't have it either in a week time, but you know, dust a bit off, clean the rust in my joints, stretch out and get this 'tank' body moving...
- I was thinking about writing down some motivational quotes
- get a simple mantra going
- I am going to drink more water
- Meditate some more
- rewire the breathing patterns. Self awareness in breathing
- already carrying plastic bags folded in my jeans in case I need to vomit (it gives me a bit more confidence)
- already bringing down the daily dose of Lorazepam I take each day, so it will be more effective next week in case I need to increase the dose because of anxiety.
- already got my music in Spotify on my phone. My favourite band Nirvana, grunge, stoner, noise and alternative rock but also soft rock in case the hard rock makes me more pumped up.
- gonna take some new photos of our two cats so I can look at them whenever I want. As mascottes.
- gonna search for some easy literature to read. 
- taking a notebook in case I get inspired and I want to write
- buy a powerbank for my phone (because it's also gonna be my TV if I want to watch anything
- gonna do a nofap this week until I'm back home, because of post orgasm sickness (also did post about this earlier)


Any more tips? For some trust and confidence and getting in the right mental state? Because I'm really trembling from time to time already, hahaha. Oh, and I hate food and eating (it's wired with the fear of vomiting (nothing in, nothing out) so that has always been an issue in my life. Even though I'm fat (give it up for anti depressants!!))

Thanks in advance!!

688,"I need to get this off my chest because its been bothering me since 2002 and I’ve developed general anxiety disorder because of it. You know the dinner scene from “Signs”? 

Mel Gibson and Joaquin Phoenix know the Aliens are invading, so the family sits down for one last meal. Joaquin Phoenix’s character says “I’ll make some sandwiches”, okay that sounds simple and easy. The young child instead says “I want spaghetti”, okay that’s a little extra work but nothing difficult. Mel Gibson then asks each family member what they want to eat. *Uh oh*.. 

The girl wants *Spaghetti*

The boy wants *French Toast with mashed potatoes*

Joaquin Phoenix wants *Chicken teriyaki*

Mel Gibson wants a *Cheeseburger with extra bacon* 

At this point I’m already picturing the nightmare going on in the kitchen. All that food, all that mess. It’s stressful enough that aliens are invading. Now you have to prepare and cook 4 different large meals!? Where did Mel get the chicken for the teriyaki? the beef for the burgers? the sauce for the spaghetti? the taters for the mash? did Mel already have all the ingredients for this extravagant feast? 

And the shit really hits the fan when they sit down and no one is even touching their food! Seriously? We just spent 3 hours cooking four different meals and nobody’s gonna eat? All that work for nothing. Just let the aliens in the house. I need a Xanax. ",1
689,"I've felt this for a long time, and I wanted to ask if others felt this way.

The best way for me to describe it would be an example.

Let's say I want to start reading more, or start playing the guitar. I have other anxiety problems related to starting new hobbies, but one big one is that I am scared of being seen doing something different for some reason. I don't want comments to me, good or bad. I don't even want people to THINK about me doing something new or different. I'm very lucky in that my family doesn't give me bad comments, but I can't even handle GOOD comments.

Why do I defeat myself like this. I sit in my room all day besides for work, but I'm terrified of doing anything to change it.

If you need more examples I can explain further.

edit: /u/dnicky brought something up that I really liked.

&gt;For me it's not just when I'm doing something new, it's when I'm doing something new that I really, truly care about. Almost as if - if people knew how much I cared about it - they'd know too much about me.

I never joined any clubs or had a job during the school year, just living off of my savings which have dwindled incredibly.
I’m confident that I have skills but none that really make me stand out as a candidate in any sort of job applications. I don’t know where I should be nor do I know where I *want* to be.

I finally decided to at least try to get out of the house. I’ve told my boyfriend no a LOT in terms of going into stores, restaurants, gas stations etc and yesterday he was really supportive and said “well let’s just go and if you need to leave, you can leave right away” 

I ended up taking only .5 of my usually 1mg anxiety med, we went to my house to get a few things done and on the way home he stopped to get gas. I was feeling kinda anxious and I decided to just go inside and get us some waters (the worst that happens is I put them back and leave and he has to go inside and get them instead?) and then I was so proud of myself. 

THEN he was going to go right home and I realized I’m always starving at his house and he knows I absolutely cannot do the grocery store. But I said “I want XYZ things” and I went inside the store, grabbed a few things (he even wandered off in another direction) AND I browsed stuff I knew I didn’t need for a couple minutes and then went and paid! 

To top this all off, I have a very hard time eating more than a few bites at a time without anxiety telling me I’m gonna puke and I don’t feel well etc etc. anyway, he said “pick a food” and I said “burgers” and we went through a drive thru and when I got home I ate an entire double cheeseburger in one go. I know to a lot of people that’s a normal meal or quick thing but I can’t remember the last time I cleared my plate, let alone didn’t have anxious thoughts the entire time.

698,"I'm a 48 y.o. gay male, and my whole life has been bound up in severe depression and anxiety.  After a severe bout of suicidal ideation a little more than 2 years ago, I did seek out professional help and was diagnosed with major depressive disorder with anxious distress.  I was referred to psychiatrist and am now on Wellbutrin and Buspar for the depression and anxiety.  While it's helped a lot, I've also learned on my own how to avoid sinking into severe depression - I can spot the symptoms early, and just the awareness doesn't really do much for the moodiness, it does help keep me from taking it personal, if that makes any sense.

The anxiety is another matter altogether.  From my armchair quarterback viewpoint, I can see that I've always had it, and outside of a few exacerbating incidents, I didn't realize it was a problem until I started getting my depression under control - which apparently was masking a lot of more overt symptoms.  Within a couple of weeks of being on a new anti-depressive med, i had a full blown panic attack that had no external triggers whatsoever ... the first time that had ever happened to me.

There are a lot of environmental things in my current life that make things bad for me, and I've worked on that a lot with my therapists.  I seem stuck though.  I'm always angry.  I'm tense all the time.  My blood pressure will spike at any moment at the least trigger.  At work, my desk has to face the door because if I don't hear someone walk up on me, I will jump or fall out of the chair and scream - which is extraordinarily embarrassing.  I scream when my husband walks up on me unawares.

My first therapist was mostly focused on my current issues, and when I brought up the possibility of me possibly having PTSD, she seemed a little irritated, and seemed to act as if I was trying to find a way to get on disability (I'm not - I enjoy working and being productive).  Because my panic attacks were causing missed work (it was also a very hostile working environment), she happily signed FMLA paperwork for me so I wouldn't get fired, thinking that had solved the problem.

When I changed therapists (due to an insurance change), she seemed a lot more intellectual, however was equally as dismissive to me having PTSD, and verbally expressed concern about how my education (I'm a master's prepared nurse educator) may be influencing my questions (essentially worrying that I might be a well-versed hypochondriac).

I certainly don't have all of the symptoms, and I'm not trying to compare myself to people who've been severely raped or suffered major psychological damage due to things they've seen in the military service of my country. I don't have have flashbacks or nightmares or memory loss, but I do experience a lot of the other symptoms . ... irritability, reckless behavior, addictive behaviors, exaggerated startle response, problems with concentration, withdrawal, detachment, etc.

My past - in the 70's, I was a very feminine young boy (we called them ""sissies"" back then) who was raised in a small southern mill town and attended a Pentecostal church ... and later went to a church school at the same church.  The bullying was more than just severe name-calling and harrassment (though there was plenty of that), but also getting beat up frequently - physical altercations occurred 2-4 times a month and forced simulated sex, usually in front of others in my class. 
 There was always the possibility of it happening since I was generally too depressed to ever fight back.  The one time I did fight back, me and the other boy were corporally punished.  Adults never did anything about it - ""boys being boys"" was generally.  When not at school, I was generally in my room at home with the door locked, trying to protect myself from a very cruel world.  Suicide was always on my mind, and I matriculated from that world as someone with zero self-esteem.

But, I wasn't raped, or at least I don't remember it.  I didn't experience war-time trauma, and again - I'm not ever wanting to discount anything anyone has experienced that was worse.  I just want to know if I'm the only one that feels like this, and if there's the possibility that this high panic state I stay in 24/7 until I pass out is something that could be PTSD?  I know I need a new therapist, but I'm really scared of starting over again and getting an identical response.",1
699,"Hi all, I've been thinking more and more that it might be good if I see a counsellor for what I think is anxiety or FOMU, which I think it is starting to affect work life. I have a friend whose going and its kind of making me think it might be good for me to.

Sometimes it gets to the point where I start telling myself that I’m not even attracted to him, that he’s ugly and that I want to be with someone who’s more attractive. 

He’s honestly the sweetest, nicest, most amazing and patient person I know. (Apart from my mom). So it’s so shallow of me to think that way. And he’s not ugly at all. He’s pretty cute actually. But these are the thoughts I usually have. Sometimes at those moments i also can’t remember any positive thing about him. And every tiny thing he does, starts annoying me. 

We also have this issue where either HE feels like he has to hold in his feelings to make sure I’m okay when I’m anxious about whatever thing or I’M the one trying to make sure he doesn’t find out that I’m anxious so he doesn’t feel like he needs to hold in or so that I don’t bring his mood down by being negative. And we can’t seem to find a way to better this issue. So that also sucks. Because every now and then he has to tell me that he’s feeling bad again because of me and that I’m bringing down his spirits by being anxious and him not being able to help me. Which I understand completely. But as a result i start holding it in which then makes me annoyed with him and makes me distance myself from him. I only recently realized that I do this and told him and he was very sweet and nice about it and I felt better afterwards. We even agreed that it’s probably better if we break up to give us both a break but we don’t want to because we love each other. 

This conversation happened a few days ago. And previously he’s already told me twice that he doesn’t know if this (us) is what he wants because of the issue i described above. And every time we have a conversation like this, I get very insecure and start being more affectionate and mushy gushy towards him and don’t feel anxious about him either. But the second I realize we’re okay again, I start getting anxious. Like just now, we were hanging out in his car for a few minutes and everything was totally fine and I was happy everything was alright again and I suddenly got anxious while we were kissing. And it confused me. As usual. I just don’t know why this keeps happening. I feel like, maybe it’s because I want to be 100% sure that he is the one for me and that there is no one better out there for me. But this is obviously impossible. I constantly go back and forth from absolutely not wanting to break to not being sure if I want to be with him and not knowing whether  I have feelings for him or not. And also thinking that he’s ugly and that I want someone who’s more attractive. 

WHY? And how do I stop this? Does anyone have any advice? Because I don’t want to keep feeling this way. It’s so exhausting. Not only for me but also for him. 

I also feel like I will never be happy if this pattern keeps continuing and that’s incredibly upsetting. ",1
702,"So a bit of backstory last year my dad's liver failed and though he recovered and managed to quit drinking it was the catalyst of this over-bearing paranoia that everyone i know is going to die. just a few weeks ago my mom got diagnosed with breast cancer and though its most likely treatable and not life-threatening. both events happened around the same time in the year, only about a year and a day apart. Now every time one of them coughs or looks a little tired i get this subtle yet present feeling that this could be it, and ive had several surreal and uneasy nightmares wherein im telling them last words and ill wake up in tears and the bed covered in sweat. Is this a common form of anxiety and does anyone know of any resources i could go to for more useful info?",1

I’ve started multiple creative avenues. Blogs, apps, social media pages and YT channels all failed (deleted because I thought I’m not good enough)

I started a podcast recently (anxiety made this podcast) and got 100 downloads so far.

Things that have helped me are:

1) I have to feel the podcast. I can’t set a time when to make an episode or I won’t stop thinking about it, I have to do it on a whim.

2) Not listening back to my episodes. My quality of sounds will suck but I would probably delete the episode out of cringe.

3) No one IRL knowing. 

4)Putting the pen to paper is easier than thinking about it. You have to get into the arena to fight the gladiator.

709,"My boss asked me if I wanted to do the register. Like an idiot, I said yes. But then a few seconds later I started getting really nervous. I went to the bathroom to breathe a little. (don’t worry, the store wasn’t open yet so it didn’t have any bad smells haha) Then I told her that I changed my mind. But she was like “Nooo you thought about it too long. You can do it.” But I really can’t. So then I started freaking out. What if I do things wrong? What if a customer cusses me out? What if I have a breakdown right then and there? So then 2 days later, my aunt asks if I’m okay. I say no and start crying. I vented. She tried to give me bullshit beliefs. By that I mean she said “Maybe if you do the register, your fear will fall away.” No. That’s not how my mind works. I told her that it makes sense but I failed to tell her that it genuinely puts me into a state of physical and mental angst. I’ve been like that ever since I was a kid. On picture day, my knees would shake. My aunt thinks that by doing things that make me uncomfortable, I’ll somehow get anxiety out of my head. Hell. No. I tried it and it’s only self harming me. It’s like walking on sharp glass and saying to yourself, “This is okay. I’m not being hurt. This will only make me stronger.” I don’t know how but I’m going to tell her that I won’t do it. She keeps asking if I’ve done it and it only makes me feel more and more guilty for not doing it.

710,"Hoping to find some advice on how to relax. Also looking for reassurance that everything will be okay. It is a bit of a long winded story, so feel free to skip down to the TLDR!

So I'll try to keep this as short as possible. I (F25) ate lots of sweets as a kid, skipped some nights of brushing my teeth, and started to grind my teeth when I was in college a couple of years ago. I wore a mouth guard on some nights to try to combat it. 

I went to the dentist back in the summer of 2017 after not going for 2 years. They told me I had taken some damage from grinding my teeth. I expected it. I was hoping there would only be cavities, but I was told I needed a root canal w/ a crown on a molar. They did it that summer, and did another root canal w/ a crown on another molar of mine half a year later in January 2018. I needed time to save money for other teeth they saw problems with. Fast forward to January of 2019, they crown another of my molars (no RCT on this one). I was told I needed another tooth crowned. I was so distraught at the news. I told them I was going to seek a second opinion from another dentist.

I visited another dentist about 2 weeks ago. He did a full oral examination of my teeth, telling me which cavities needed to be retouched a little. Nothing big. He then did an x-ray of my teeth and informed me the first root canal I had done a year and a half ago hasn't healed yet. He also told me the crown I had done recently back in January of this year is not a good fit and is bulky (This could explain the pain I was feeling from this tooth for the past two months, sensitivity to cold drinks and hurts when biting down on food).

I am mostly just looking for the light at the end of the tunnel here. My main concerns are that my root canal doesn't heal properly and will have to be retreated (more money and more pain). If that doesn't work, it would have to possibly be extracted and I'd have to get an implant (tons of money). The crowned tooth that is hurting me right now would have to be potential recrowned. If that doesn't work, I'd have to get another root canal... 

I know it's not the end of the world. I'm lucky I can save up enough money for the treatments I need now. But I am so stressed about how much more I could potentially spend on my teeth. I'm worried about all my root canals failing in the future and needing to replace them all with implants. I am just so worn down, and my thoughts are constantly about my teeth. ""Will I be okay? Will the root canal heal? Do I really need more of these?? When will they fail? Will my other cavities turn into crowns and root canals?"" Every day I am online looking at dental forums and reaching out to dentists, asking for answers. My anxiety is on full blast as I'm stuck in the middle of all of these procedures. My mind hates not knowing what is to come. I am thinking of the ""what ifs"" and am creating worst case scenarios in my head...

But amidst my thoughts, I realized I also needed to vent and to have a good cry as I type this out. If you fully read this, I can't thank you enough. This is what has been on repeat in my brain for the past couple of months. I've been crying everyday as soon as I get off of work. My anxiety has been terrible. My body has been so tight. My throat gets a bump in it that I can't burp away. I can't catch my breath. If anyone has any advice on how I can be positive, how I can try to get my mind off of everything, or if you've been in a situation like this before, I would love to hear from you. Even if it's just a simple ""feel better"", it would help me immensely. Thank you.


TLDR; I have had two root canals w/ crowns done, have a crowned tooth, and have a couple other cavities. Was recently told one of the root canals is not healing well, and that my crowned tooth might have to get recrowned or have a root canal done on it. I'm stressed out about not knowing what will happen. I'm low on funds. I'm so anxious.",1
711,"I used to have just terrible anxiety. Terrible. In the past year, it seems to have subsided, but three years ago, I got a hearing test, because I noticed it didn't seem as acute, and I had constant tinnitus. The testing came back as significant hearing loss. I questioned this immediately, because according to the testing methodology, I had very little hearing, yet I could converse just fine, albeit with issues in the car, etc. They gave me hearing aids and sent me on my merry way. Since then, I notice my hearing doesn't seem nearly as bad anymore in one ear. According to all lore, this is impossible, which makes me wonder if it was psychosomatic because of the anxiety, and this makes me nervous to ever need hearing tests again because they'll see a discrepancy and accuse me of something.

Have any of you experienced hearing changes with your anxiety?",1
712,"I posted about this awhile ago and didn’t get much response.  I’m hoping to get some advice! 

I know that I tend to overthink and over analyze EVERYTHING.  So I’m aware that most of this is in my head... I could still use some advice! 

I struggle with having social anxiety ever since I was with my abusive ex.  We were together for almost 6 years and broke up 4 years ago. I thank god every day that I was strong enough to get out of that relationship but the effects of the abuse are still on the forefront of my every day life.  He led me to believe that every conversation or interaction I had with others was pathetic and he criticized everything that I said and did.   I was selfish and stupid and no one liked me (his words not mine).  Before dating him, I would have considered myself an extrovert.  

Once we broke up I thought I’d go back to my outgoing and friendly self without any issues.  Boy was I wrong.  I find myself avoiding every social situation and when I talk to others I’m constantly filtering what I’m saying or I worry about how I came across after the conversation. I’ve become EXTREMELY introverted to the point that I almost always decline invitations to social events as I am overcome with crippling anxiety at the idea of it. 

I don’t have many close friends as I’ve grown apart from the friends I grew up with.  I moved out of state with my ex after a year or so of dating so the only friends I had nearby where his friends.  After our breakup I literally had no one.  

I finally got a steady job and made a close friend at work.  We were close until we both got different jobs.  Honestly, we started growing apart maybe a year before that when she and another friend we worked with both had their kids.  I felt like they got closer and I wasn’t a part of the “club” so I got left out of certain things.  

Anyway, her and I have been struggling to keep in touch.  I feel like it’s very one sided with me constantly being the one that has to reach out. More recently, she forgot my birthday.  My one close friend forgot my damn birthday.  Meanwhile I attend every birthday party for her son and was the first one to wish her happy birthday this year.  

I know I shouldn’t keep score but it the reality of it is, I’m just not as important of a friend to her as she is for me.  We haven’t talked seen each other in person for months and have maybe texted twice in the last month or so.  She did send me an invite to her son’s birthday party recently and honestly, I don’t want to go.  It’s an hour away and I know how she operates at those kinds of events. I’ll be lucky if I even get two minutes to talk to her. 

I know I’m probably overthinking it and I was going to bring it up to her, but I avoid conflict like the plague.  I do want to let her know that I was hurt about her forgetting my birthday and that the lack of communication and effort on her part makes me feel awful. 

This is a tough age.  I’m 32 and I’m beginning to realize that the majority of my friendships have been lost to marriage or motherhood.   In reality, I know those relationships obviously weren’t as strong as I thought they were otherwise they wouldn’t fizzle out so quickly.   I know plenty of people who are married and have kids that have managed to maintain friendships so I know it can be done.   It just feels like it’s a club that everyone else is in, and because I’m not married or have kids, there’s no reason to include me in things. 

Aside from the specific friend issue, I want to learn how to be more social and to stop worrying about what others think.  I want to finally make more friends and get my social life back.  I just don’t know how to make friends. When I was younger it was easy because I met people at school.  I’ve tried to make friends at my job and have made one kind of close friend, but she never wants to hang out and now she’s pregnant with her first child.  She assured me she’d still be around after having her daughter but time will tell.  Plus she has a close group of girlfriends and I feel like I’m just her work acquaintance.  She’s also very flaky and will often interrupt me during conversations or will ignore me when other coworkers are around. 

I’ve thought about using bumble BFF or another app to find girlfriends but it feels awkward.  I found my bf on tinder which is great but it feels weird being on an app looking for friends.  I honestly feel like somethings wrong with me. 

Any advice on how to approach the issue with my friend or how to go about making friends is much appreciated!  I know that a lot of my issues stem from my anxiety and depression issues.  I know that I need to work though those as well.  ",1

714,"I hope this is the right subreddit to ask this but I guess I just need some advice. I feel so anxious &amp; insecure around seemingly everyone. The anxious &amp; insecure part of me is always comparing myself to others and it always results in me being brought down &amp; giving up. I get so discouraged so easily and it's easier to tell myself to give up and that I suck at whatever Im doing rather than to push through. What do I do in those times where the anxiety of not being good enough &amp; failing gets the best of me?

I have a girlfriend and I love her so much, but she's so much more motivated than I am and it sucks because I can't help but compare myself to her. We're both in our first year of college but she's graduating in two years while I'm graduating in four. We talked last night and she mentioned that she needs to be going at a faster pace than everyone else. I know it's not that she wants to better than anyone, it's just the pace she wants to be at intrinsically. It just sucks when my first thought is ""damn, I'm such a dumbass because, if I'm lucky, I'm going at the normal pace"" I never give myself any credit &amp; I'm proud of few things, if any.

I don't want my first reactionary thoughts to be those of insecurity and jealousy. It's the same thing with my friends. I don't want to feel that. I support the hell out of them and I want to be able to without being nervous of them nonintentionally putting me down.

I'm sorry if this is kind of a disjointed rant, I can elaborate further if anyone asks but I guess I just want some advice if that's cool by you guys. ",1
715,"Last night around midnight there was a knock at the door- we are in an apartment complex and it’s not unheard of for a neighbor to knock due to an issue.  However, I looked through the peephole and it was a lady I didn’t recognize, a skinny white lady.  I opened the door and kept my shoulder on it in case it was trouble; she immediately launched into a scatterbrained tank about needing to borrow a phone- I said “hold on” and closed the door and relocated it.  I asked my wife what she thought ( she was sitting on a couch in the living room where the door is), she just shrugged.  I turned off the lights and went silent- she hung around the door a few minutes and then left.

Since then (today) I’ve been in a constant state of anxiety- I’ve read and heard about this tactic being used to break into people homes- I have a long running fear of a home invasion and someone hurting my pets or wife with me unable to do anything- I feel like I’m going to die when I have these thoughts and today they’ve been nonstop.  I can’t believe I was so stupid to open the door- I should have just shouted through the door or something.

Hello, hope everyone is doing well--spring is here, you best be doing well ;)! Today I'm looking for advice about how to handle abandonment issues. Long story short, I had a really chaotic upbringing and its left a toll on my adult psyche. I'm currently 19 and a freshman in college. This has been an underlying issue for me my whole life, but I've never really taken heed to it until I got into personal development &amp; meditation; now, i've realized, this has been destroying me life! Having this issue has been so omnipresent that I had no idea I even had it! 

&amp;#x200B;

&lt;!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

If you don't have abandonment issues, I'll briefly fill you in; if you're reading this because you too suffer from it, go ahead and skip this section. 

I've destroyed relationships, friendships, and infinitely indefinite amount of potential relationships &amp; friendships. Basically I've observed that it comes down to two separate domains, each with its own set of issues. The first domain of issues is the idea that people hate me, don't like me, and that there's no way they could actually like me. unbelievably stunning, beautiful, and intelligent women have made their way into my life and I've destroyed all those relationships because I just didn't believe they were actually into me. Out of 25 kids I was one of the only two chosen to be initiated in one my school's fraternities, but I dropped it today because I felt like there's no way these people like me &amp; they hated me. The second domain is walking on eggshells: ""now I did it."" This thought controls my mind. When ever I say anything, do anything, etc, I instantly feel like ""now I did it. That was it. Everyone hates me now. Now they're leaving you for sure."" Basically that's my life story. 

\------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------&gt;

Anyways, freshman year was an awesome experience! I've met so many people, hooked up with a lot girls, etc, etc, but it's all very shallow... I'm lucky I suppose, I don't have any social anxiety, and I'm a pretty confident guy. I'm able to meet people, laugh, vibe, and enjoy each-others presence--girls, guys, teachers, adults, bosses, etc--but when it's time to make a real connection, that's when things go really bad... I become cold, aloof, antisocial, etc. I imagen I hurt people's feelings because I'll get so bogged down by this idea that they don't actually like me, they hate me, that I'll stop waving &amp; interacting with them all together. I'm sure I leave them vexed &amp; hurt. (but I don't know if they hated me to begin with)

  
I'm self-aware enough to watch this phenomena happen before my eyes: I feel like a prisoner in my own mind. What makes me the most angry is I can't distinguish the difference between this mental fabrication from actuality. I can't tell if someone actually hates me because I did something wrong, or it's just a delusion my mind is projecting. (walking on egg shells again)

&amp;#x200B;

I wish it was just as easy as not paying attention to it, but it's imbedded deep into my psyche and I don't know how to fix this issue. I really like myself, like I'm happy playing this character in the human experience, if that makes sense. This is destroying my life. Have any of you recovered or found solutions?

717,"It’s actually crazy how much my anxiety controls me. How it can physically make my stomach churn. I think the worst part is that I struggle with hyperhidrosis which is directly related to my anxiety, aka a double hit to my mental sanity. 

It’s why I’m scared to be open with friends or family about just how bad my mental health can get. With friends, maybe I’ll share a bit here and there. Never the full extent of damage. With family? Not an option. They’re too close-minded and old-fashioned about mental health. “Just don’t think about it” is the sage wisdom they have on anxiety basically. 

These two issues (of HH and anxiety) are why I feel I’ll never be confident enough for finding a significant other. Hell, they’re why I think sometimes “50 or 60 more years and then I’ll be dead and won’t have to deal. 5-6 decades.” I wouldn’t say I’m suicidal per say, but I do have times where I just wish I wasn’t alive. I’m not particularly smart or attractive or generous. Don’t know what my long-term goals in life are. I just feel like I’m floating sometimes. 

I have siblings that are all doing great things and hitting big life milestones (having kids, looking for a house, getting into residency, getting married, securing a post-law school job) and I just feel like I’m sitting here, still the youngest in the family as usual - but now I’m 19 (going on 20) and not 8. 8 was a fine time to be shy and unsure.

718,"Hi everyone,

&amp;#x200B;

I just wanted to talk about the type of anxiety that has plagued me for a long time. It is a combination of depression and anxiety that I call anxious listlessness. I really haven't talked about it much with anyone, but want to write some of this down because writing things down helps me figure out what to do. If anyone else wants to add some specific things they experience with their anxiety, go right ahead. It's totally open.

&amp;#x200B;

Here is what my experience is like:

* I feel guilty for doing nothing, but have no energy nor desire to do anything. 
* I cycle through things to do constantly, but the heaviness in my body and mind talk me out of doing anything appealing almost immediately. 
* The thought of doing anything productive is riddled with so many what-ifs that I become afraid and never even start. 
* The thought of talking to anyone about it is terrifying. When I do, I keep my head low and mention it in passing. 
* Seeing other people being productive or having a hobby makes me feel worse. My spouse is very involved in a hobby, but I mostly jut watch and wish I could care about something that much. It makes me feel useless.
* I crave something, but don't know what it is. 
* Everything is so temporary right now and it makes it a hundred times worse. I am relocating across the country soon and have a job lined up, which put me on cloud 9 for a few days. Now, I am trying to figure out our living situation once we get there and there are so many variables and so many things dependent on other things, I cant focus on anything else but cant get anything done with the information I have. Its an obsession tied up in things over which I have no control and its like torture. The temporary feeling in everything makes me feel like I cant move forward with anything in my life until this insane puzzle is finished, and I cant even find the corner pieces. 
* I feel tired all the time, even if I haven't done much. 
* When in doubt, I just clean and cook. Or pack. I already packed so many things in the house to prepare for our move and I don't know what to do with myself now. Its just waiting. I cant start anything big and new since I'm leaving soon, but I desperately need something to keep me engaged in the meantime. I just don't know what. My home is clean, food is in the fridge, and what I can pack early has been packed. I have no energy or room for anything else and just want to fast forward. I just pace around my home, afraid to sit down in fear of being perceived as lazy, desperately looking for something small and engaging I can do. I cant find anything anymore.
* I just want it to be rainy and awful outside so I don't have to look out the window at the beautiful, sunny day and feel guilty I'm not outside doing something. Today its cold, so I have an excuse to stay inside. I miss being outside. I backpacked Yosemite a few years ago and used to camp and hike all the time. Now just riding my bike takes a conscious effort. It feels like recreational activities take up precious time I could be spending doing something more important, even if there is nothing more important to do.
* Every time I do something productive, I feel like its never enough. Last week, I cleaned up all the trash in the yard, planted grass seed, raked, and planted flower bulbs. Yesterday, I did all the laundry, meal prepped for the week, swept and mopped all the floors, and had a nice dinner with my spouse. Today, I took my dogs for a long walk, cleaned my kitchen, scrubbed the sink, and made breakfast from scratch. I still feel lazy and useless - like I haven't done enough and never will. But there's nothing else I want to do.
* I don't have any desire to spend time with friends and family anymore, even though I used to be more social. All I want to do every day is be at home. I secretly want to do nothing, by myself, all the time, but my spouse coming in and out of the door from the garage makes my heart race. I know he doesn't judge me or care what I am doing or not doing with my free time, but my mind assumes everyone else judges me as harshly as I judge myself. He can be engaged all day doing something he loves. I can barely find the energy or motivation to do anything I enjoy. I only do things I have to do and nothing I want to do. 
* I feel guilty for random things that don't make sense. Yesterday, I mulled around Target for an hour and bought a $6 shirt on clearance with my own money. I hid it when I got home, feeling like I didn't deserve it or that I was being irresponsible. I felt bad going there without any need. I just wanted to walk around as an anonymous person somewhere. When I came home, I felt like a shallow person who fills voids with things - like a $6 shirt. 
* I try to remember my therapist telling me to give myself a break, let my mind rest, accept that it is due to a chemical imbalance and that I should not be ashamed of myself, and let inspiration come to me naturally. It never does. It just gets worse. 
* I spend all day, every day breathing shallow breaths and tensing my entire body for no reason and its almost impossible to stop, even with meditation.

723,"My version of anxiety is spinning in an external circle of “holy crap my life is on fire and everything is going to explode in T-10 seconds.” I get so over stimulated and so intense that it’s just like I could flip out on anyone in an immediate radius. I’m not abusive about it or violent, it’s more of a general need to push everything around me away and get into a calm, less stimulated space ASAP kind of drive.

His anxiety is an internal spiral of the world is ending and he’s silently panicking inside.

He is extremely sensitive to my freak outs. To give one example, I was driving a few months ago and the road conditions sucked, visibility sucked, it was dark and I ran over a snow covered part of a concrete island. No damage, just a jolt and my heart beating out of my chest... he said “Whoa! What was that? Are you okay?” And my frenzy at the moment just stumped my speech centre was kaput! I couldn’t find words, my brain was just 0 to 100 and nothing logical was happening. I said something so bitchy and harsh not even thinking about the implications of it other than my need to stop anything stimulating, “PLEASE, stop talking!”  

Today I was on the phone and freaking out because something had gone through on our credit card and we did not authorize it, so I’m losing it. He’s trying to rationalize it out loud which is totally harmless but he was talking, the CS agent was talking and my brain was not doing dual processing at the moment, I raised my hand in a “Stop!” motion...

I fully admit these are not healthy responses, and I know what’s going on in my head. But, when he receives these it’s like I’m berating and chastising him... which just happens to be a major trigger. I try to be conscious... but sometimes it just slips! I’m afraid of it being really abusive to him and I 100% do not want that to be the case. Trying to explain what’s going on in my head doesn’t really forgive it, what can I do in these moments to just catch it and calm the situation instead? Does anyone else get this? What do you do?",1

This started 3 weeks ago where I touched his penis for like 5 minutes, and no cum or pre-cum occured, and then 20 minutes later he touched me over my jeans and then touched me over my underwear. He never actually touched me. It got worse when last sunday i gave him a hand job and blow job, and he ejaculated on my chest. I was wearing shorts and underwear, but my anxiety convinced me it somehow entered my vagina. His penis has never been anywhere near my vagina without several layers of clothing.

727,Second day with my new meds. Shout-out to my friend who messaged me last night after seeing my first post. You da real MVP. Im feeling a little better. Just slightlyyy weird lol. I CAN DO THIS AND SO CAN YOU GUYS! Much love!,1
728,"Hello there and welcome to my first post, I tend to be somewhat verbose which is not really the best way to capture attention on a reddit post! I do hope you can indulge me. 




I'm doing great recently, I've been in therapy for a year dealing with depressive thoughts and my wife's nervous breakdown last year (she's doing great now, better than we ever could have hoped!), but my anxiety is getting out of control. I did delay dealing with my own issues during my wife's recovery but she's f-ing eel and I've found the space to come to terms with some of my problems. 



I've got back on my feet this last year, back exercising, took up writing, become a house husband when off work since my wife works longer hours,  starting to get ready to socialise again, it's been great and I'm feeling good. But let me explain what's happening with my anexity:



I live in a slightly rough area and my house is situated on a T junction on street with allot of children. The area outside my house is the hangout for quite a few of them. Two years ago they were younger and would knock on our door and run away. We became targeted by one girl in particular who would encourage the kids to mess with us. That girl is gone these days and most of the kids have grown up and only play football (though the sound of the ball also makes me anxious). The knocks on the door have declined but still happen occasionally, kids are kids so I can't really blame them but it's driving me crazy.  



At this point ANY noise on the road sets my anxiety off and can lead to my heart beating out of control, Butterflies in my stomach, sweat, dry mouth. Symptoms vary depending on if the kids are amassed or if they are just passing. But my fear of the noise is entirely dominating my life. Every waking moment I'm thinking about what could happen, I wake up and I think about it, I go to work and think about it, when I'm going to sleep etc etc etc. I even check the weather to see if it will rain so I can relax. 




The other aspect is that I play games to relax, to escape the world, and my tower is in the living room next to the window facing on to the street. So if I'm gaming for an hour or two the kids can see that I'm there. It has occurred to me to move my rig to the back of the house to get away from my trigger but I feel the root of the issue might be worth exploring. 



I think I'll stop here and answer any questions that may arise. Without a doubt I'm suffering and it's getting out of control, and I'll be talking to my therapist about this but any and all advice is welcome. Finally if I have left out any pertinent information please let me know. Thank you for your time. ",1
729,"i was put on 37.5mg last year for social anxiety but a month and a half ago my doctor diagnosed me with depression and raised it to 75mg. i am feeling fine with it except for my issues with sleeping and some reduced libido. whenever i take the pill usually an hour or so after i've taken it i feel very lightheaded, my head hurts, i'm tired, i feel slight nausea, and possibly some slight vertigo. until recently, i kept forgetting to take it on time and have been taking it late (only for 3 days) but i'm not sure if it is the medication itself or the dosage? or the fact that i've been taking it an hour later? also, i feel kind of disconnected from my feelings after my dose was raised; i feel as though if i think of something that makes me sad i can't really fully feel it and kind of work my way through it. it's like i have a big block in my brain and it literally prevents me from feeling much or even crying when i want to cry. 

just wanted to hear some general experiences and if i should be concerned about any of this?",1
730,"please tell me i’m not alone. i have the worst bouts of anxiety. along with having ocd and dealing with those symptoms, i also have generalized anxiety and often for extremely anxious for seemingly no reason. sometimes it’ll start when i wake up, other times the middle of the day, but every time it happens it’s not triggered by anything (but it’s made worse by thinking of eating/food/being sick), i get shaky, nauseous, irritable. i feel so physically horrible that i’m almost always stuck in bed. i’ve dropped out of school because of this (and other health reasons.) 
i have emetophobia- so on one hand i understand why i get anxious. especially if i’ve been sick recently, but i don’t understand how to make it go away. it’s been 2 months since the original trigger (me being sick) happened, and i’m still having anxiety randomly and about eating, and i don’t know what to do.
i’m on 150mg of zoloft, gabapentin 3 times a day, and hydroxyzine or ativan as needed depending on the severity, and promethazine for nausea as needed. if you experience this kind of anxiety please let me know. i feel so alone.

731,"Hi,

&amp;#x200B;

I am not really sure where to post this but I'm not sure how I am supposed to move along, if I can.

Approximately a year ago I did a jaw surgery that was not necessary, yes, you heard it right.

&amp;#x200B;

It all started a few years earlier when I was taken off my braces and the process started of wearing a plastic attachment for my teeth for a few months ahead. I was sloppy with it and the result ended in a gap between my teeth, quite a big one.

&amp;#x200B;

Jumping forward approximately two years ago I once again started to wear braces and the process of fixing the gap started. For some reason I did not want to tell the dentist that it was most likely due to me being sloppy with the plastic attachment, I am not sure if I felt ashamed or similar. The issue with me is that I have a really hard time to be honest about my feelings and this is not the first time I have been in situations where I have just accepted it, for example being bullied, being quite lonely, left jobs due to social phobia. It feels like eventually I am gonna realize all the stuff I never dared to tell people and feel loads of anxiety.

&amp;#x200B;

As I sit here and write I feel nauseous and that I have let down family. That I do not have the courage to tell people how I feel or when I feel bad keeps getting me into situations I do not want. Luckily enough, the surgery was quite minimal and I look pretty much the same. But it is not about that, it is about taking an issue that I do not dare to tell family or others and elevate it to something like this.

&amp;#x200B;

I have no clue how to move forward from this, almost every evening I think about it and it makes me feel so so bad about myself.",1
732,"I am 26 years old and I’ve lived my entire life with anxiety. As far back as I can remember (5 years old) I would throw tantrums because I didn’t want to go to school or after school activities. I used to cry a lot as a baby up until about 11. I remember having the worst nausea and stomach aches because of my anxiety. My parents were very hands-off in raising me and they were not (and are still not) available emotionally throughout my life. This definitely has made my anxiety worse.

When I turned 18 I decided to get treatment, but because I have Kaiser (a subpar medical insurance imo), it was hard to get a therapist who didn’t have appointments that were 1-2 months apart. I felt it wasn’t safe for me to be taking medication if I wasn’t able to see my therapist on a consistent basis. I have been on Zoloft, Prozac, etc. and it has not helped. I’ve also been prescribed Klonopin which is the only thing that did help but we all know it isn’t safe for long term use. I currently just started seeing a therapist but I don’t know if we mesh well. She diagnosed me with panic disorder but I don’t really know if what I have is that.  

I hate my job. I am in retail in service experience and have to deal with people for 8-9 hours a day. I don’t know what to do with my life. I didn’t go to college, and even if I wanted to at this point I need to work full time just to afford my life. School gives me anxiety. I want to eventually do things I enjoy to create a career for myself but I don’t even know how to do that with my anxiousness. 

My anxiousness comes in the mornings, when I’m driving, and with difficult customers. I mostly just get sweaty and my heart races. The physical symptoms really outweigh everything else. Even when I don’t feel anxious I get sweaty and it triggers my anxiety... does this make sense? If I could control these physical symptoms like my racing heart and sweat I wouldn’t become (more) anxious. 

What can I do to resolve this? ",1

I literally can’t even walk out the house and see someone with out panicking ,1
734,"I do admit that I am not exactly the most adept when it comes to social skills. I know that I have social anxiety and I have had it for years.

&amp;#x200B;

Sometimes I behave in ways that one would describe as odd or unorthodox - I can sometimes be very blunt and direct and honest, I can sometimes be very quiet and reserved, and sometimes I can just make the big leap and introduce myself or simply just jump into someone else's bubble or discussions without going into the formalities first because it is an anxious and awkward thing to do.

&amp;#x200B;

Then again, I still remind myself that there is no clear why of describing ""good"" social skills because everyone behaves differently and everyone has their own way of expressing themselves.

&amp;#x200B;

But that being said, the thing that irritates and scares me the most is when I am pushed away or given the silent treatment or not communicated with for a while or worst, being ghosted.

&amp;#x200B;

I know that you will not connect with everyone and I know that different people have different preferences and will react differently on how you act and have their own priorities on whether they should give that person a chance or just behave on their own instincts or unconscious biases and just avoid that person because he/she is too odd or that there is something off about them

&amp;#x200B;

But I realised that this happens all the time irregardless of how I approach myself or irregardless of how geniune I try to be or honest or whether I make an effort to fake it until I make it.

&amp;#x200B;

And this not only pisses me off because I hate it when people just do not have the balls to say it out front that they do not want to talk to you or just did not connect with you (I know that not everyone has the courage but I still find it as a shitty excuse to leave someone in the dark), but makes me so damn self-conscious about myself and how people see me and especially how I see myself.

&amp;#x200B;

Social anxiety often keeps on the edge over every tiny little detail that pops up in your head, whether the worry is geniune or just an over-exaggarated delusion or a simple problem that you go into it too deeply. And every time this happens, I go into worry overboard and makes me wonder whether I really am as much of a weirdo or whether the approach would have been better if I did a bit differently or whatever ""what-if"" scenario you can think of that puts you in a state of rumination for hours even though it does not get you anyway.

&amp;#x200B;

It becomes very personal and filled with angst and worry and sheer depression and sorrow which puts me in a constant loop of continous increase in my social anxiety, refusal to interact with others, sheer over-thinking and over-analysing every tiny little detail to the point of a sheer burnout, and wondering why I have not been able to contact with anyone which fills me with shame, regret and embarassement.

&amp;#x200B;

It is annoying, frustrating and just damnright tormenting. I know that this is all done by myself and the only perpetrator here is me, myself and I alone. But it is really damn hard to convince yourself to get a grip about this especially when this involves on how you think about yourself right in your very core of your soul and how you somehow paradoxically are used to being alone or used to this storm of emotions and anxiety and torment (and I mean this in a somewhat healthy way, not in a learned helplessness kind of way) even though there are those moments where feeling lonely and anxious just feel like you are carrying so much weight. I know that to some extent, this is all in my head even though it actually pretty real and feels very geniune and intense but damn it it hurts",1
735,"I feel honestly well rested, it's just I feel a bit drowsy still despite sleeping for 9 hours. Took 50 mgs before bed, but laid in bed for about an hour until I passed out.

I don't really plan on using it except to sleep on nights where I have class the next day, as I don't want the effects to wear off and I don't want to rely on it as a crutch either. Tomorrow I have class, so hopefully it still works. I get really nervous about going to class, and I'm in the process of getting a new therapist, so I'm hopefully in the clear once I start going to class.",1
736,"I tried taking SSRIs years ago and hated them. It felt like all they did was make me into a half zombie and destroy my ability to orgasm. I was really loathe to try meds again for a long time but after self medicating with weed and alcohol and trying CBD oil and struggling with insomnia for so long, I decided to try again.

I described my hatred of SSRIs to my PA and she prescribed buspirone. I was skeptical of it because of posts online where people said it did nothing, or that it only worked for people in Seattle where it was discovered, but after taking it for a few months I'm pretty sure it does help.

I still have some anxiety but it just feels like it's down a notch or two. My IBS has been in control, I haven't felt that absolute, floor-falling-out-from-me panic I used to feel on the regular in a very long time, and I haven't really felt the need for the self medicating either.

I guess I just wanted to share this somewhere. I guess it is true that you should just try different meds until you find one that works. Hopefully this keeps up. Not having that super powerful anxiety all the time has only made me more aware of how much I hated it.",1

738,"Hi all,

&amp;#x200B;

I get stress and anxiety, mostly around relationship issues (being single/lonely or failed relationships).  I am currently in an acute period of stress/anxiety that I am trying to fix (most notably - insomnia \[sleep maintenance - can't stay asleep\])

&amp;#x200B;

I should be documenting all this because I can't tell causes/effects.  

&amp;#x200B;

I developed new anxiety symptoms:

&amp;#x200B;

* face feeling pressure (as if someone is cutting off circulation and blood is pooling in my face longside pressure)
* becoming pretty vascular relative to normal times
* stomach burning sensation like i swallowed really hot sauce with sandpaper (this is new too)

&amp;#x200B;

What's going on:

1. Acute stress/anxiety from a failed relationship
2. Taking many herbs/vitamins (consistent with Vitamin C since i'm so beat up from exercise and emotional stress - curious if this could cause burning sensation and anxiety)
3. Sometimes it's burning sensation in my stomach and regurgitating food (could have a burning taste or just the actual food - GERD or Rumination? neither?) I use marijuana 1x a week and that could contribute to a weak esophagus but not sure it's the culprit

Any similar experiences/solutions/thoughts?

TL;DR - I have acute stress/anxiety attacks with burning stomach sensation and notice that every-time I swallow I get air/bubble stuck in my throw and then burp after - that's happened most of my life I believe.",1

743,"I feel like I have a very strange case of anxiety/GAD/depression that has stumped my GP's for years...  


I used to smoke a lot of weed. After a few years of it i noticed: lump in my mouth making it difficult to swallow, clicks in my throat, brain fog, lots of hair loss and alopecia when I was sleep deprived (long flights/exam season). My hair was super thick and it has started to become dry and crispy, shedding a lot whenever I smoked. The damage always happened during my sleep, or lack of quality sleep as i'd always wake up prematurely with intense restless legs and scattered mind.  Whenever I stopped smoking weed, I would sleep \*fine\* and would even sleep extra long and thoroughly, like my body was making up for lost sleep. When this happened my hair loss immediately stopped. I realised I had GAD/mild depression even though I had NOTHING to be anxious or depressed about. I started taking a citalopram SSRI and after two weeks I was fine, hair was silky smooth, not falling out, could sleep properly. So i stupidly started smoking again and a month later the symptoms returned. 

&amp;#x200B;

 I've tried going back on SSRI's and even upping the dose, but it doesn't seem to have the same healing effect. Has my body gotten used to them? I loved smoking weed so much I thought it was worth the damage, especially since I knew how to make it stop... or so I thought.  


Cut to a few years later and my has receded and thinned so much that 3 weeks ago I have given up smoking, drinking, caffeine altogether. The problem is in those 3 weeks i still have anxiety ridden sleep, restless legs and reduced hair loss, but still shedding. 

&amp;#x200B;

I've read that it takes 3 months to trigger hair loss from a cause, but i'm 100% sure that the days I drink and smoke, I wake up with tonnes of hair on my pillow, and striking restless sensation on my legs.

Thats why Im considering to chicken out, to not do it.

749,"Hi guys and girls, hope you’re doing well. A quick summary of me and my life, in 22 and I’ve suffered from pure OCD for 6 years with varying degrees of intensity. Over summer I started a relationship with the most beautiful girl in the world but since then my OCD has spiked as I care about her so much, I’ve worried what if I have ED and it ruins the relationship, I have tinnitus and I’ve worried what if it gets way worse and ruins the relationship, I’ve been worried I’m gay and don’t realise for the past few months, now I know these are all not true as I know my own pattern with Pure OCD I recognise the signs. And when I say worry I mean going over things in my head every waking moment, battling my own head, it is truly exhausting, I’m in CBT but I’m on a break as my therapist has had to take time off. I can feel it slowly wearing me down.

And now the main question, I know I love my gf and she’s super attractive but this constant questioning own mind and fighting myself has destroyed my self confidence. Outwardly I’m a very confident person, I’m one of those people you’d never expect to be suffering, a gym goer, social, makes everyone laugh and always smiling. But it’s getting harder to hide as I’m no longer always smiling so my gf notices more and more. Anyway, how do I build my self confidence? This constant battling has me feeling worthless, the constant fighting my own head about my relationship makes me feel like I’m not a good bf. A bit graphic I know but I’ve always had regular sex, either daily or once every two days, but now I’ve lost all interest in sex, porn or sexual stimulation in general. Mayybe not lost interest, I really want to have sex but I can’t, I worry I won’t keep an erection and constantly check during sex, which I know is wrong, but now I just don’t feel confident or worthy enough to start anything, I don’t feel like a man,  which only serves to worry me more. How do I build myself back up? I feel if I don’t have sex then it’ll ruin the relationship but then that’s putting too much pressure on myself, along with the other OCD reasons that take me out of the moment which makes sex more of a test for myself rather than something to enjoy. Also I have spoken to my gf about it in a limited capacity but it’s a newish relationship, I’m her first bf and her understanding of mental health isn’t the best, she sometimes doesn’t understand that these thoughts are irrational, plus I don’t want her to take all my baggage (I know people will say find someone who you can tell everything to, but that’ll come with time.

The worst thing is, I know my worth, I’m a 6’4, muscly, charming guy who’s been told by my superiors I have a bright future and I’m a good example, everyone tells me how I funny I am. Now I’m not vain I have flaws like everyone else, but to constantly have to think about myself as a disgusting disappointment or battle myself having to convince my subconscious I’m not something I know I’m not is exhausting and it truly does drain life of its pleasure. The only time I can relax is when I have something rational to worry about e.g. money etc.",1

I try to keep her happy and do as much as possible for her so she’s in a good mood it’s really worth it bc she’s really crazy when she’s upset or angry.

She doesn’t care about much but her nails friends and makeup. She’s got no aspirations and just is so angry at the world. So when she’s in a mood I’m on edge. If my cat jumps the fence for a long period of time I get on edge. If I don’t complete my bedtime routine I get a shitty sleep and I’m on edge the next day. If I don’t have my eye mask or earplugs in a dark room with no sound I don’t sleep well and I’m on edge. 

I need to be in control of everything. This is my only coping mechanism that works for me. But I want it to change bc I can feel my boyfriend is finding me sometimes to be a bit of a princess. But I also love being a princess. I want to talk to him about this but i feel like I’ll probs have a mental break down in front of him and he won’t be able to handle that. He’s got enough of his own problems as it is. 

I’m so sorry if this doesn’t make sense to you I’m having a really hard time explaining how I feel atm. I’m not sure what I’m feeling and I can’t sleep right now because I’m not in control of my emotions. It’s stressing me out.

0,"Welcome to /r/depression's check-in post - a place to take a moment and share what is going on and how you are doing. If you have an accomplishment you want to talk about (these shouldn't be standalone posts in the sub as they violate the ""role model"" rule, but are welcome here), or are having a tough time but prefer not to make your own post, this is a place you can share.

We try our best to keep this space as safe and supportive as possible on reddit's wide-open anonymity-friendly platform. The community rules can be found in the sidebar, or under ""Community Info"" in the official mobile apps. If you aren't sure about a rule, [please ask us](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Fdepression). 

*****

Sorry about letting the last post get archived.  We've been super-busy keeping up with the modqueue and that's slowing down our work on making the community rules more clear and visible and migrated to the standard reddit rules system - we *are* spending all the available time we have on that.  In the meantime, if you're on mobile, please read the info and rules which are under ""Community Info"" on the menu when you're visiting the subreddit.  

I'd like to highlight the most common violations that create extra work for us.  Please use reddit's ""report"" function when you see anything like that.  The exact reasons are less important than the existence of a report, because that puts it in our modqueue where we will look at it first chance we get.  

*  Helpers inviting private contact as a first resort.  Nobody who's both well-meaning and knowledgeable should ever do this.  Please keep your conversations out in the public threads unless/until you've established a solid rapport, and preferably let the OP decide when it's time to go private.   

* ""I'm here to help"" posts.  These are specifically against the rules.  

* Posts that aren't directly relevant to personal experience of depression, the mental illness and/or aren't requests for support.  Everything we do here is based on our core belief that talking about depression is both important and difficult, so we need to be strict about keeping on-topic.  You don't need to have a clinical diagnosis of depression to post here, but, on the other hand, being diagnosed doesn't mean it's okay for you to talk about anything.  For example, depression is *not* loneliness, it's not low self-esteem, and it's not being sad or distressed for good reasons.  Those are all important and serious issues too, and they should be discussed, but this is not the place.  

**Edit:**  I wrote this in a comment reply below but I want to highlight it here:  We enforce the rules as leniently as possible in the case of people who have come here to get support, but strictly in the case of people who are here for any other reason. We think it makes sense to ask people who are giving help to police themselves, but we try to cut people in need of help as much slack as we can without allowing discussions that take focus away from others in need of support. 

If you have concerns or questions about community business or moderation, please talk to us [in modmail](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Fdepression) before you make a post about it.  

Thanks to everyone for their courage in sharing their struggles, and their kindness in supporting others.  ",0

A girl i used to watch and lurk in here chat room was on after a few years of me not seeing her. Something told me to stop in one last time. It ended up being one of the best decision i have ever made. Somehow we struck up a conversation out of thin air. The conversation continued the next night. And the next. Surprisingly i had forgotten all about my plans. I ACTUALLY started looking forward to the next day and our next conversation. Fast forward a few weeks and I'm still here. Still talking to her almost daily. I don't know if it will last, but for today I'm still here and for that i will always be grateful to the unlikeliest person in the world a CAM GIRL!!!!




Edit: This is my first post on Reddit I did not expect such a response.    I felt I should clarify some of this. Yes she is a cam girl and that is how we meet. But over the weeks it has transitioned into a friendship I didn't expect. No I'm not expecting a relationship or really anything from her. It's just she has been through some dark days herself so we can just talk to each other when we want/need to about the things people without mental illness just don't understand or whatever we feel like talking about. The point of the post was that I found a genuine friend in the last place I would expect. And maybe if I can find some one like that in the weirdest way possible all hope isn't lost yet. ",0
5,"(I'm sorry in advance if this comes off as entitled and spoiled, I am quite spoiled. One of the reasons why I don't understand anything. I do not deserve this life.)

my birthday is in less than a week and my parents and friends have been asking for the past weeks what I'm planning and I just say nothing. Because I don't want to celebrate it. It makes me so fucking sad that I'll already be 20 and I'm still not dead yet nor achieved anything at all, I never will. 

Nevertheless, my friends and especially my parents don't understand that I just want to stay home and I don't need/want any gifts.  I just want to be left alone. I don't see what I add to social events anyway, and I don't understand why people don't even try to understand that.

Does anyone have any good tips on explaining this desire to stay home and take it easy, or excuses to not have to go places? I'd like to quickly settle it with everyone in a respectful manner, I don't want them to get mad or irritated since I'll be scared I will be so as well.",0
6,"I saw a post on here earlier today that was talking about how depression has taken their personality away from them. This really struck a chord with me, as I often feel dull and disconnected from myself and everyone else. But I’ve been thinking about it and, unlike what most people seem to say about losing a part of themselves, I can’t remember a time when I was ever “whole.” I don’t know who I was before this. I’m not even sure there was a before. Maybe it’s just me. Maybe I’ve never been normal, and maybe I never can be. Maybe there’s nothing for me to look forward to. Maybe there’s no way out. It might always control me because maybe it is just *me*.

I really associate everyone and everything in my life with negativity. I feel like I just need to cut everyone off and start over. I have resources and a fairly wealthy family so I have options, I could go to a smaller school. These experience has matured me really fast and I feel like I can't vibe with kids my own age anymore. I used to be pretty outgoing but I'm really quiet and insecure now and it sucks.

13,"Ever since I was younger (like 11-12) I’ve been depressed. It didn’t get really bad until I was 14-15. But up until that point I tried to.. I guess put on a happy face and act like nothing was wrong. So once it became bad it came kind of like a shock to everyone (my family and certain friends) because I’m “so happy and cheerful” all the time. It all went downhill from there though. I was basically being denied that I had depression, it got even worse, and with that I got extreme anxiety too. I was barely going to school when I was in high school because I was so anxious/depressed and have so many panic attacks so I would just walk away the second I got there. (I’m 21 now) It was really bad. But on the multiple times I’ve told my family about it they didn’t understand it. I thought okay fair.. cultural difference; they’re not from here and mental health IS only starting to get de-stigmatized. Obviously I was noticeably skipping school so my teachers were wondering what’s up and I ended up breaking down to my school counsellor that it was hard for me because I was depressed and I was having like 3 panic attacks a day. I knew about this other course kinda thing that was aimed more towards kids like me.. it was the same courses but not as overwhelming? I hate that I sound so sensitive. Anyway basically I was denied it all until I got to my last year of high school and they realized that I actually might not graduate. Tbh I was suicidal so I didn’t really care how well I did or not.

But here’s the thing. Like I said before, I’ve told my family multiple times. They didn’t understand it. But I have a cousin who is also depressed and they always talk about her depression and how we should help her out more etc.. when she comes over it’s all about making sure she’s okay and has a good time.. and I’m not JEALOUS of her I’m just confused because my parents act like me having depression is impossible even though my cousin is essentially the same. As for high school, I had another friend who was also depressed &amp; anxious but wasn’t denied anything at all... yet when it came to me it was like yeah right.

I always get guilt tripped too. It’s always like oh YOU feel bad? Well imagine how xxx feels. Or that someone has it worse than me. Stuff like that. It’s really changed how I talk about myself tbh. I know that people have it worse than me. So why should I feel the way that I do? I think like this to myself all the time but it makes me feel worse tbh.

I think people have an image of me that I’m happy and cheerful 24/7 and I want to be but I’m not and it fucking sucks because I did so bad in high school because I was so depressed and tried to reach out to family and school to help me but they didn’t until the last minute. Even now I don’t talk to my family about depression. I’ve only started to take and try medication once I turned 18 because they would let me.

Lately shit has been harder than usual again. I feel like I’m falling down the same pit I did in high school and it’s endless. I just hate myself so much. I really wish I could talk about it but everyone has this vision of me that they can’t seem to get out of their heads so me having depression and anxiety is impossible to them. I don’t even want attention I just want support. I’m going to be try and get past this on my own as usual. But this really fucking sucks.",0

I feel like I’ve lost everyone, and wish I could go back and save all the bridges I burnt. There were so many things I could have done differently. 

I’m stuck into thinking about the past and all I lost and it’s like I can’t move on. I want new relationships and friends, but in my current state it’s impossible to get close to anyone.

Ever since my depression started at the age of 10, I’ve been convinced that my cause of death will be suicide. It sounds horrible, but I’ve just accepted that fact. It’s not going to happen anytime soon, but I know that it’ll probably happen. I’ve never seen myself with a future. And this isn’t asking for advice, just seeing if anyone has the same mindset?

idk, i feel like everybody fucking hates me. whenever i make new friends and we get close, they end up fucking abandoning me for no reason. i mean i'm not one to stop them from talking to me, but could they at least give me closure? this happens a lot. it makes me feel like i have some sort of problem. it makes me hate myself.
and my old childhood friends who have been with me for years will never abandon me but damn, they aren't very comfortable around me either, in that they don't share stuff with me and they don't even include me in their plans and i end up being ignored most of the time with them.
 a lot of the times people have blatantly called me ""annoying"" when i opened up and socialised, but i only did what they asked me to do - TO OPEN UP AND SOCIALISE. i mean they hate it when im quiet and shy but when i socialise they have a problem again. like make your fucking mind up. 

i don't know, i feel miserable. i don't know why people do this shit. and i know that if someone happens to come across this the only comments will be ""you know, try therapy"" or ""talk to someone"" (doesn't help btw) or ""oh sweetie you must have some problem you mustn't be aware of and that's why people leave you"" like bitch ... i've literally asked them what the fucking problem is and they don't wanna tell me. and i can't find a problem with myself either but hey guess what, i guess a random stranger on the internet must be correct ?
anyway if you read this and sympathised thank you. please don't comment shit on here. i'm already in a pretty shitty place as it is and i don't need any more crap.

20,"I know that for some people they got depressed/mentally ill at a certain age, but they were able to live a good or okay life for the most part up until then. 
I have never had that though. That “normal” life most healthy individuals get to have.
By that I mean that they grow up having normal experiences like having friends in school, hanging out with them outside of school, joining clubs, being social, having those cliché middle and high school relationships, learning how to drive at 16, etc. 

I, for the most part, have not experienced these things. Growing up I was extremely shy and did not know how to socialize and this really held me back in making friends. I developed social anxiety when I got to middle school and this made me avoid socializing even more which made me continue to get outcasted and an easy target for bullying.
Up until high school, I had never had any genuine friends. The “friends” I had before high school were people who pitied me enough to talk to me and they would mostly leave me out of the group conversations and never asked me to hang out with them after school. 

For some reason things changed when I went to high school. I guess it was a mixture of puberty, a small surge of confidence, and a strong yearning for change in my life. I did not want to repeat elementary and middle school again, so I did everything I could to prevent that. The summer before high school I spent my time researching social skills and looking at YouTube videos of people my age to see what was “cool” and what wasn’t. I pretty much just studied people like a mad scientist until I was able to pass off as “normal”. I also did some changes to my appearance and started dressing better. 
Long story short, I went to high school for only one year until my trauma from getting bullied everyday in middle school caught up to me. But let me say that this one year of high school was one of the greatest times of my life. That was the only time in my life so far that I have felt like a normal person and I strongly desire to feel this again. 

I dropped out of high school due to my mental health and I lost all friends and haven’t had a life since. Lately I’ve been thinking about how isolated and sheltered my life has been, if you can even call this a life. I’m wondering if other people have had a shitty lonely life like me. 

It’s really sad that the highlight of my life so far has been to feel like a normal person and have friends. Majority of people have this all the time and they don’t even appreciate it.",0

23,"Going to take some time to accept it but that's the way it is. As kissless virgin 18 year old female, I have absolutely never felt attracted to at all, nor received any male attention in my life, except a few catcalls from drunk men and being groped on my way to school at 6 in the morning, which was just scary, if anything. I'm not attractive, my face is too broad and fat, my features too coarse to be considered feminine. I'm pretty overweight, I'm working on getting in shape but as my depression and self hatred keep getting worse I feel like it's not even worth trying anymore. I'll never look the way I want to look. No matter how much time and money and energy I spend on losing weight and getting plastic surgery, it will never be satisfying enough. I'm sick of the ""body positivity"" movement going around telling everyone that they're beautiful when nothing could be farther from the truth. Some people are attractive, others are not. I'm not saying ugly people don't deserve to be happy, but I find people who like to believe that beauty standards don't exist delusional. We tend to find certain feaures more aesthetically pleasing, and that's just a natural aspect of physical attraction if anything.

As somebody who is a 2/10 at best, it was absolutely heartbreaking to realise that I have nothing to offer to someone, sexually or romantically, because I'm as ugly on the inside as I am on the outside. I go around acting like I don't care about my appearance and keep telling friends that I couldn't care less about not having had any intimate relationships, the truth is that I achingly need to feel desired. But at the same time, if someone were to show any kind of interest in me whatsoever, I'd immediately think what kind of a pathetic and desperate loser they have to be in order to be attracted to somebody as unappealing, ugly, selfish, cynical and borderline disgusting as me. I just want to be able to completely shut off my sexual/emotional side and continue my life alone and without the need to feel wanted, because it seems like the easiest way out for me.",0

25,"Pun semi-intended.

I’m a 21yo male in my senior year of college, and I literally cannot remember a time where I wasn’t completely devoid of energy. I slog though the day, but every time I have to try to hold a conversation I can feel it draining what little mental capacity I have left. Idk if my depression medication helps that much; all I know is that it levels me out so I feel consistent, but consistent in his case means consistently tired and emotionless. I guess that’s better than extremely sad.

I’ve been diagnosed with ADD as well, so I have a prescription for adderall. When I take the adderall, I feel like my old self again — the kid who used to enjoy taking on DIY projects and hanging out with friends, who had capacity for intelligent thought and problem solving, who had a certain degree of creativity and a good deal of motivation. I feel awake and alive, and I can thrive socially. I can feel optimistic. I know it’s an amphetamine, hence the energy boost, but it feels like the only way to get to “normal”. 

I just don’t know how to keep shuffling through like a zombie anymore. I don’t like to have to depend on drugs, when everyone else is already full of energy without the same crutch. I exercise every day, I eat healthy, I get enough sleep, but I still feel drained. Like a plant that hasn’t been watered. I feel like the personification of a glass of flat soda.

No higher deity would allow this, this much pain, this much negativity in his creation.

I’ve had a severe case of bullying for my looks in the past and I’ve been rejected mainly for my looks. When someone compliments me it’s always “you have a nice personality”, I’ve never heard anyone compliment me on my looks apart from out of pity.

49,"Hello. Throwaway account. I've been debating posting this or not but I don't care at this point... I'm feeling overwhelmingly sad and needed to share with someone what's gnawing at me inside.

About a year ago, I began noticing signs that something was wrong with me. It was after a devastating break up with my very first boyfriend (we were college sweethearts and he was literally my first everything). We've never had an easy relationship and I spiraled after breaking up-- I just never felt the same. About two months after breaking up, we get back together after I begged him-- I know this isn't exactly healthy either.

Now, I'm turning 24 and just completed a two-week intensive mental health therapy session. I have no family history of mental illness so this was all extremely new to me. I was diagnosed with Borderline Personality Disorder and this freaked me out. I have the kind of family that is happy, go-lucky all the time and I haven't told them yet. I live on the West coast while they are on the East. I live with my bf and we've been together 5 years now. He's been supportive of me getting help but he's also seemingly emotional unavailable. I struggle with this. He is the type of person who seems to never be bothered and his go-to motto is to ""move on""; no use crying over spilled milk, as he puts it. I'm so desperate for an understanding person.  Since I completed my two week sessions, I thought I was getting better but have already had two noticeable arguments/fights with my bf where I feel like I'm still crazy and not right in the head.

It's so hard to try to get him to understand me. He thinks I'm being overly emotional and often questions, ""Why I can't just let things go"". I have a history of repressing my feelings, sadness, tears, emotions because of this; it stems back to my childhood. When I feel myself spiraling or getting obsessive over a seemingly non-important issue, I tell myself, ""Why can't I just be like him and let things go?"" He makes me feel like a crazy person. I know I'm not crazy. My brain is just wired differently and I express myself differently. I just needed to rant and ask for someone to listen. I'm at work today after a terrible night where a situation occurred and I feel like crap. But, to whoever is reading, thank you for your time. I really hope your day is going better than mine!

I honestly just don’t care about anything for some reason. I am more vocal to people and can’t keep my words inside.

56,"At this point, I feel pretty much disgusted with myself and how I have been acting/treating other people. I think I am a pretty good guy but since this overwhelming feeling of depression and social anxiety has taken hold, I am really down and thinking that I am basically the worst human to walk the planet. I have been told I'm shallow, I'm weird, and I walk into a room and the conversation dies. 

All I want to do is be lively and talkative but my mind is just so in my own head that no matter how hard I try, I am barely present and it is nearly impossible to pay attention yet alone engage in conversation. My memory is toast and I have a constant feeling of head pressure likely due to the anxiety of always feeling like I need to change myself. 

Anyway, has anyone else felt this way and how did you overcome it? Is it possible to recite a mantra telling yourself that you are great 1000 times a day until you actually believe it? I'm just so sick of feeling down about myself 24/7 because I really am a cool guy that people want to be around when I'm not in my own head. ",0

59,"My actual personality is over the top, fun(in my opinion), confident, and kind. But the depression teams up with social anxiety so that I just don't have enough enough energy to act like who I truly am. I turn into this very flat, monotone, boring, quiet person who I would never want to hang out with or date.

It's the main reason I avoid social interaction now - it feels humiliating because I feel like I'm perceived as this pathetic, pitiable, ignorable person.

 When I'm feeling better and have a little more energy I can act like myself but usually I'm just this shell. It's horrible, like watching the progression of ALS in a loved one; they just slowly fade away until there's nothing left of who they used to be. At least with physical illness or bipolar or whatever you have yourself, that fundamental spark of who you truly are, and you're able to show that and share that with others. I don't even have that privilege. 

Sorry if this comes off as arrogant or insensitive, this is just how I feel.

edit: Guys, thanks so much for all the responses. I appreciate all of you. I didn't know so many people felt the same way, and I'm glad if I was able to help give voice to your struggles. I've had depression my whole life so I've had a lot of time to think about these things. I think it helps to be able to really narrow down what you're feeling.

60,"TW: self- harm

Backstory: 
I was diagnosed with severe depression and anxiety at age 15 during my first stay at a psych hospital,but never got on medication because my parents don't believe in depression, anxiety or medicating kids.

Now I am a junior in college and almost in 3rd semester of nursing school. Nothing has changed. In fact everythings just gotten worse. I have 2-4 panic attacks a week, have started shutting down/ disassociating more and more, and have started cutting again after being clean for a year and a half. 

Since I'm now 21 I could go to the doctor to get put on medication, but I'm scared of the possible side effects and how it could affect me during school. I'm also terrified that if the school finds out that they will kick me out of the program. 

Thanks for taking the time to read. I would greatly appreciate any advice or knowledge that anyone has regarding any of this. ",0

No one ever cares

No one ever really wants me around

67,"I have a good job and good career.  I make pretty good money and don’t hate what I do, but I don’t have any passion for it and more and more and more I just find myself sitting at my desk at work staring at a screen doing nothing.  

Lately I’ve started writing at work instead of pretending to work on my actual work.  I’m an indie author and I actually do have passion for it unlike my real career and job but I’m relatively new to the game and make probably around $1000 a month from my one published book so far. Hardly enough to live off of where I live.  

I’ve got terrible anxiety that my company will realize how useless I am at work and fire me and honestly I am pretty useless. I collect a paycheck and hardly do anything to help the company.  Worse I honestly don’t care.  I really could care less about helping make some investors that own the company more money.  I’m so fucking selfish I know, but my only motivators for work are money and fear.  

 I shared this with my spouse the other day and she was supportive of course.  Obviously she worries about our bills (mortgage, student loans, and car payments you know the usual) and whatnot if I do get fired or go full time as an indie author making a whopping $12k a year.  She thinks I need to move to a different company but honestly it’s been this way at the last 3 places I’ve worked over the last 6 or so years. I’ve just gotten worse at tricking myself into caring.  

I wish I was more like her. She has a freaking amazing work ethic, type A personality and all that.  She does a great job where she works and probably never worries she’ll be discovered as a fraud.  

My work ethic sucks, unless it’s something I can get passionate about and I’ve struggled motivating myself my whole life.  People say you learn work ethic growing up but I had a workaholic father and worked jobs all through high school and college and I still never got one.  I think something is wrong with me.  

Anyways I’m trying not (and failing) to wallow in this all consuming depression right now.  I know how much better I’ve got it than most and I’m so selfish I can’t even be happy about that.

I don’t know really what I’m saying. It just makes me mad to see people so awestruck when a seemingly positive and happy kid has depression or ends their life.

I haven’t read the whole thing, just the bits my counselor read to me when we were going through a basic list of symptoms. But also I read other subs here and people describe symptoms and whatnot that I don’t experience at all.

I’ve also attended 3 different colleges already... The only reason I’m still doing this is bc my mom constantly emphasizes how i won’t be able to get a good job without a bachelors degree. I do however have an associates degree but it’s pretty useless.

Every major I’ve tried to pursue has either led to me switching because I can’t handle the workload or bc I don’t find the major practical for life after graduation. Hell, sometimes I’m too damn stupid to comprehend the material and it intimidates me so I look for other options. 

I’ve been in college for almost five years now. (my high school offered a concurrent enrollment program). I don’t know what to do anymore. I can’t find a major I can be passionate about. I’ve talked to guidance counselors about this but I never get any straight forward answers. I feel like an idiot who can’t pick a path and stick to it.

I like the college town life but I hate school. All I do is show up to classes, try not to zone out during lectures, mindlessly write notes and then slave away behind my pc in attempt at writing mediocre C- papers I couldn’t care less about. I’m only motivated by the fear of failure and the financial consequences of it. I get sick just thinking about how heavy the weight of my academic responsibilities are.

God I hate the way that drug makes me feel but I can’t operate without it. 

I’m absolutely miserable in school. I feel so lost. The guilt of my selfishness rips me to shreds. My parents are far from rich and honestly I don’t even know how they can afford to pay for my tuition. In the end all I want to do is to be able to afford to live comfortably on my own and be happy. I’m scared and I’m tired.  I just want to be free. I just don’t have the drive or passion of the students I see around me. Something awful is going to happen, and it’s all going to be my fault. 

I have a history of running away from my problems. Quitting both the wrestling and track team mid season senior year in high school, moving out at midnight from my ex’s apartment and spontaneously quitting a good job I had lined up after learning she fell out of love with me,(that whole thing fucked me up real good.) and the numerous cases of me looking for escapes from college classes bc I can’t handle the stress. I can’t keep living like this. I wish I could just die or runaway but I’m in too deep.

So I been at a kindergarten a few times. And today their boss visited and talked with the people that work here. Then she called me in and asked me to work Monday-Friday. I got super happy and said yes. But now an hour later I’m realising it’s not for long. “Till summer” is only like 3 months. Then I’m nowhere again beside something more to write on my CV.

Honestly tho as I’m writing this, I’m realising that I feel like I’m not ready for all the responsibilities of a full time job. I don’t even hate being a “jump in” I get to see many kindergarten’s. The only issue tho with only jump around is one month i might work a lot. But the next month I work like nothing. And I wanna earn enough money so I can move from home.

I know my mindset is wrong thinking like this. Like yo, u just got a job till summer at ur favourite kindergarten. + it’s a great way to practice on ur social anxiety. The fact that the boss called you in is a big deal. Even tho it’s only till summer it’s a great working experience and might lead to bigger things.

But yea...

TLDR: got a full time job till summer. But I’m realising it’s only till summer then I’m back at the start having a fragile working schedule. It’s better than nothing tho.",0

I want to feel good and it's really frustrating that I can't control that. All I do now is smoke cigarettes. I smoke a lot bc it makes me feel good. I am thinking about smoking weed again.

started nursing school a month back, but I realized that this just isn't for me.

104,"I spent a large chunk of time from age 17 to late 19 doing absolutely nothing because of my depression. Nothing might be an exaggeration but I definitely missed out on a lot of things due to this illness. I've spent months at a time just sat indoors reading reddit and watching dumb videos to numb my sadness. 

I had quite a wild youth in many ways and I can't say that I didn't have a lot of fun at times but that seems unimportant in the face of so many lost days, weeks and months. I also was so camera shy and insecure that most pictures from my teenage years are selfies and for large periods of time, there are no pictures of me at all. The regret I feel for not overcoming my camera shyness sooner is also haunting me. My friends all have tons of pictures of them with other friends and I have so few. I can't stop thinking about this, it's almost become an obsession. 

 In the run up to 20, I promised myself I would change things and I have. I've made huge progress but I feel like its all irrelevant and pointless because I will never be a teenager again and I will never be able to relive my wasted youth. It's killing me inside and I think about committing suicide just to make these thoughts stop. It's like my brain is torturing me by constantly reminding me of the things I missed out on. 

I'm trying so fucking hard to move forward but I am consumed by this regret. Suicide seems like the only way to make this stop. I feel like I wasted some of the best years in a humans life and knowing there is nothing I can do to change this is unbearable. I feel so fucking sad and nobody seems to understand the pain I'm in.

Sorry for the big chunk of text but I just needed to get this off my chest. ",0
105,"Disclaimer: I've only been diagnosed with depression, everything else I mention in this post is just how I feel.

Tl;dr abandonment issues, strange persistent feeling of loss or that something bad happened, even though I haven't gone through something like that

So, this is awkward to say, but I feel like I had a great loss, or something idk that was left unresolved. I get this eerie feeling of loss for some years now, it's either random, or triggered by something that deals with the subject, like some musics. The thing is, I don't recall experiencing a loss like that, and I don't have a clear explanation to that. I have some remarkable events and factors that might explain it, or at least explain other things*

- I had a babysitter that was basically my caretaker up until 7 yo, since my parents were out all the day working or studying, and after that she left and I didn't get to see her for a long time, and  when I got, it was for a very short time

- I left my hometown, where my relatives lived, when I was 10, and moved to a city that didn't have any relatives or friends

- After I moved the only meaningful friendship I stablished was abusive. I could go on and give more details if it is needed, but basically it made my self esteem go down a lot, and the friend in question isolated me, so I didn't have anyone else

- I feel that I have abandonment issues* ( don't know if is a consequence of the previous things, or if it has to do with the loss feeling), I get jealous of my friends, sometimes I try and distance myself emotionally from them, because I feel like they'll leave me, or ditch me for someone else, for say, a boyfriend, or that they don't really like me that much Edit: Forgot to said that I'm emotionally  immature with them, I get mad or sad or both over really small and stupid reasons, which prompts me to ignore them and be salty, until I realize that I'm being dumb and stupid. I'm very emotionally closed too, I don't tell people my feeling and just let them pile up until I explode (which takes months)

- Im transgender (MTF)... Don't know if has something to do with it... It's here in case it does

So that's the stuff I feel like could be significant to that feeling, but, like I said, I'm not sure if it explains away my feeling, could it be that I have gone through other thing that I don't remember, either by being too young or just blocked out, that made me feel that way ? People how have experience with the subject, please tell me your experiences and what you think",0
106,"Sorry for the rant. This post isn't intended to find answers, I just want to vent.

I have so far been very lucky in life. I am young, fit, have a good career and have a loving, beautiful partner. Our life looks very picture perfect on the surface and I do at times experience genuine joy.

But I have also come to discover that I experience periods of depression. It is something that I have been aware of for the past several years, but it started out as pretty insignificant. I only recently realized that my depression had gone from rare, short occurrences to a majority of the time where I feel like life has no purpose (although I thankfully have no thoughts of self harm or suicide).

I have made major efforts to ""fix"" my depression. I quit drinking, I started exercising regularly, I took up more hobbies, etc. I live a very productive life that nobody would associate with a depressed person and yet here I am. I have done everything I could to make a fulfilling life for myself, but my depression still loomed.

So I realized that maybe my brain is a little broken. I'm okay with that. I decided to talk to my doctor about it. This was difficult for me. I was raised in an Irish Catholic home and find it very difficult to talk about my emotions, despite being a very sensitive person. I typically get overwhelmed and begin to sob to the point where I can't speak until it passes. Only my sister and partner have witnessed me like this.

So I made an appointment to see my family doctor. I didn't feel comfortable telling the receptionist that the appointment was for my depression, so I said that I wanted to check up on some minor issues I had been having.

In the appointment, we went over the minor issue and came up with a solution for that. He then asked me if I had any other health concerns. Every part of me wanted to say ""Nope, all good Doc! Thanks a bunch!"", but I managed to bring up that I had been dealing with depression and wanted to discuss treatment.

I forget exactly what he said because it really shocked me, but it was along the lines of ""I don't have the time to address this right now and it's probably just a seasonal thing"". He told me to make an appointment in a few months if I still feel the same way.

Like I said I'm not looking for answers or anything. I'm sure there are plenty of people that claim to be suffering from depression for different reasons, but it took a lot for me to even bring it up and then just like that, I was dismissed. I realize that I've been living with this for years and a couple more months won't make a big difference, but it made me feel so worthless and small. Just another event in life that has made me feel like I should keep my emotions to myself.

If you made it this far, thanks for reading. I'm in this for the long haul, so I will get the treatment I need, but I just wanted to get this off my chest. I hope you have an excellent day!",0
107,"i know this isn’t really about me, but i have to say it somewhere. i love him so much. god, i really do love him. he is so depressed, much more than i am. he’ll tell me that he doesn’t want to be alive, quite so often but not like all the time. but tonight he said he actually wanted to kill himself. he texted me that he was suicidal. i don’t know what to do. i told him that i was there for him, and that i’ll support him through everything. and i really do mean it. i’m so scared. i even texted his mom about what was going on because i wasn’t able to be there physically to help him. i’m very glad that i did that, but i don’t think it helped all that much. i’m scared every night that i’ll wake up in the morning to find the terrible news that he’s gone forever. it makes me nauseous to think about him gone. i can’t talk about it without bursting down crying. i’m so scared. i’m so so scared. when i go to school in the morning all i’m thinking about is him, until i see him in the hallways. how do i help him. please, he doesn’t deserve to feel so shitty all of the time. i’m so scared that one day when he says he’s going to kill himself, he’ll actually do it.",0
108,"I didn't get to see my usual Dr. today when I went to renew my prescription. I am only on 50mg of sertraline (zoloft), and from my understanding it is pretty mild and I'm not having side effects. But he was talking about coming off of it and he only gave me 6 months rather than the 12 I usually get.

This is is really irritating to me because in my city there is a shortage of Dr.s so the walk in clinic is the only option for most, and you have to go there early to line up outside an hour or more before the place even opens to get an appointment. It's a huge pain in the ass. So now I will have to do this all over again in six months.

But what is the reason for even wanting me to go off? This drug is life changing for me and stopping is not really an option. I suffered for 10+ years before I got help and there is no way I am going back to that.",0

I’ve never had a girlfriend and I never will becuz of how ugly and unbearably annoying I am and I don’t deserve one anyway. I don’t deserve to be happy and I don’t deserve to live I just wanna die and I pray that I either die or gain the strength to kill my self because I shouldn’t live.

111,"Is anyone else hyper-aware of the fact that they can’t deal with things the way people without mental illnesses can? Yes, I know that I feel things much too strongly, and every single stressor seems to turn into a life-or-death situation for me. Every day I become more aware of the fact that I simply cannot function the way a normal person can. Everything is much harder for me to deal with, and even getting out of bed is a constant struggle (as cliché as that is). I overthink so much that I hurt my own feelings, and it feels like I’m constantly running from myself, even though I know I can never escape. So, yes, I know I got 8 hours of sleep, but I’m so exhausted from this fight. 

Does this inability to function/deal with emotions/etc as well as “normal” people ever get to anyone else? Like, I can cope as much as possible, and do everything right, take all the medicines, but I will always be sick. And it’s exhausting.",0

114,"So recently against my better judgement my ex girlfriend came back to me and told me that she missed me and she wanted to be back in my life and I was extremely happy because up until we broke up I had raised her child from birth. It was the happiest day of my life and it was the happiest 2 years of my entire life... then out of nowhere she began cheating and then abandon me and our home and went to the other side of the nation. I was partially to blame for my alcoholic Tendencies but towards the end it was pure chaos and I was looking for an escape anyway I could.

My life completely ended so to speak for that chapter I picked up my roots and I moved back closer to family to pick myself back up. 

I rebuilt my life got myself into a new career making much more money I got all of my bills paid down and wiped out my debt. And then she decided she wanted to come back into my life.

She talked to smooth game talked about moving in with me letting me back into the only child I've ever known as my son's life. I thought I had done it all of my wildest dreams had come true. Maybe in the fool that I am she said that I would need a bigger living space if she were to move down here and I went out of the way and let her select what area of the city we would be in despite cheaper alternatives to my bachelor lifestyle. I rented the house got preparations in order started decorating my son's new room. I was in pure ecstasy.

My ex-girlfriend currently lives with my best friend and it's a complicated situation but basically I have found out that since the beginning of our little 2 months long-distance relationship she has been seeing some other guy and has been making preparations to move in with him. 

I'm absolutely floored. I feel played and cheated I feel like absolute garbage. My long list of life accomplishments now means nothing as my self-confidence has never been lower. I don't understand how somebody can look you in the face tell you how much they miss you and that they love you and then be so vile. The last three years of my life have revolved around this woman and they seem like they are all for nothing. 

Better yet this continues to happen on a cycle, my past three serious relationships have all ended the same way and it's starting to give me self-worth issues, I'm a hard worker I've always held down two jobs to the best of my ability and put my first foot forward when it comes to effort on accomplishing my goals, but right now I can't even leave my house. I'm extremely surprised that I'm still sober during all of this because traditionally stress of this magnitude has always landed me in jail due to my drinking.

I don't know why I'm typing all of this out I guess I just want people to listen because right now it seems like my life is falling apart again, and I have to make a tough situation of cutting her out of my life and never getting to have a relationship with that amazing, cute little boy who still calls me daddy. I've never been the kind of person I have Suicidal Tendencies but I have to say in the past 2 weeks I have had this stuff popping into my head more and more.

The night I found out about the whole thing I had to go to work at night and just the thought of her going home to some other guy spending time with my child... I was looking around and it was 11 at night on a not so busy part of the interstate, I was the only car around on my stretch. For a moment I close my eyes and I just put my foot to the pedal, the only thing that really snap me out of it is my car going over the semi-truck strip and I thought about my family missing me and pulled over, spent 20 minutes crying in my car untill a state trooper pulled up behind me to check if I was ok. I just unloaded.

He sat there for about 10 minutes and listened to me babble, I'm a grown ass man and I was sitting there in tears talking to a man in uniform about my fucking relationship issues. He told me things would be okay I just got in his car and told me to get to wherever I was going safely.

Ever since that night nothing seems right I have this rock in the bottom of my stomach that won't move, I can't keep down any food in the morning I throw up at least once, and every night I shake myself to sleep only to wake back up 15 minutes later drenched in a pubble of my own sweat.

Anyways I don't really know what I'm doing here and I don't know what this feeling is I've experienced it before but never to such a level that for the first time in my life, I'm ok with not waking up the next day.",0
115,"Ok, and? That doesn't make it easier. Saying that it will get better in the future (which doesn't always happen to everyone despite the story book ending people want you to believe) ignores the current situation I'm in now. It's like I'm expected to forget the horrible things I feel now. That doesn't make me feel any better. I need help now. I need to cope now. I want to get rid of this pain and loneliness now. It's like going up to a homeless person and saying, ""Don't worry, you'll be rich in the future."" Okay, great, but they're poor *now.* They need that money *now.*

Also I hate the idea that just because I'm younger, people assume I have more of an opportunity to make friends. That make ring true for some, but if you're as socially inept as I am, trying to start a conversation is like rocket science.

I know when people say that I'm still young, they're just trying to help. I'm just tired of the cliche statements getting thrown my way.

A bit about myself first. I finished my master thesis a month ago and am now about to start working on my PhD. Together with my collegues I am participating in a 6-day long conference about our work in physics. There I held a presentation about the results of my master thesis and I completely fucked it up. I have always been super nervouswhen giving presentations and I just can't seem to get better in it.

So, after my talk I went out to get drunk. I got drunk really fast and then had a breakdown in the middle of the city. I started crying, screaming and hitting myself in the face. At first, everybody just stared at me, then some guy came up to me asking if I needed a hug. I took the offer, we talked about an hour or so and then went to his place. He asked me if he could kiss me and I let him do it. Then he asked me if I wanted to have sex with him. I said yes. At first, it was ""normal"" sex but then it got kind of odd. He told me that for this night I would belong solely to him and he started thrusting really hard. He choked me, started slapping my ass and breasts and finally slapped me in the face. The weird thing was, that I liked it and I am scared of that.

All I'm interested in is having it all be over, and it sucks that it has to be that way, but there is no other way. There is nothing for me in life. The only hope I have is for there to be something better on the other side. The only thing I can be sure of in life is increased suffering. There is no joy. Joy is a lie. Joy is not real in my subjective experience. I don't even want to be happy anymore. ",0

Hey. 'Tis me, completely random person. Let me introduce you to my venting post.

I've been feeling pretty shit, to be honest. To put this entire thing into perspective, I'll go to the very start of all of this.

Before mid 2018 I had but *one* friend. I've known him for about four years. It's not the type of friend that I can tell everything to, however, as weird as that may seem. He wants to be friends with everyone, and thus I felt like I was just another one of those friends (I think he considered someone else that has been here for but a few months to be a better friend, even.

In november (maybe even a little earlier), however, he introduced me to his ""friend group"". They were my classmates, but I hadn't spent much time with them at all. I just knew them. They weren't real ""friends"". I knew nothing about them. But that changed, and especially one person stuck out. Our first real encounter was over text, where I gave her some advice on how to deal with a person that's depressed (her friend was (and most likely is, but I'm not sure) depressed). Only after a couple hours did we stop texting.

Later that month, when we came together, I saw her again, and when everyone had left, we stayed to talk a little bit longer. And that was magical. I began to trust her in a matter of seconds. I felt like I could tell her anything from the very beginning.

Later, on normal weekdays even, but also in the weekends, she'd hint at the fact that she wanted to be added to my group call through very adorable text messages. Sometimes my friend didn't want her to join. In that case I'd wait it out till 11pm, whereafter I'd call her. Here as well I felt comfortable, appreciated, loved, and comforted in a matter of seconds. First we stopped at 12am, then at 1:30, then at 2:00, then at 3:00. Time or sleep was of no importance, I just wanted to talk to her.

I recall so many good memories when I think about those calls again. I remember her adorable laugh when I got up out of my chair to put my pillow back on my bed. I'd asked her ""what about it?"" and the only thing she did was say ""nothing"", whereafter she giggled.

I also recall her falling asleep when we were deep into the night. I had waited 15 minutes whispering her name every now and then to check if she was still awake. I could go on and on and on and on...

This all stopped when winter break hit. I went on a short vacation for a week. The parties had stopped. That week was perhaps one of the shittiest weeks of my life. I didn't get any sleep. I'd be up all night thinking about her. Non-stop. I wasn't able to distract myself. I could only think about her. I got home absolutely destroyed. But I had hope. Because we were planning to come together for New Year's again. I got to talk to her for about 10 minutes, I think. That was nice. But nothing after that. I got home very, very sad.

The parties that followed were an absolute pain for me. She would be there, but she'd developed other interests, such as dancing. A critical point was somewhere in the middle of March 2019. After one of the parties I got home and cried for 3 hours straight. I hadn't cried seriously in more than 8 months. Perhaps a year even.

I always get a mini heart attack when I get a phone notification, wishing it might be her. She messaged me about two weeks ago, actually. She noticed I'd been quite depressed at the party and other people'd noticed it too. She said that I could talk to her or anyone else if I wanted to.

But I fucking can't. Because I'm introverted as shit. And I HATE that about me. I know that I can't do anything about my introversion and ""that it's a part of me"" but I fucking hate it so much. The signs were there. She liked me, I liked her. If I wasn't so fucking introverted I could've made it work. She even put ""You're keeping me awake at night"" as her status for a couple weeks. But I ignored every single bit of it.

And now I'm lonely. The parties have stopped, I don't talk to my friend group anymore, my ""friend"" I've known for 4 years I can't tell a single thing to. I want someone that I can trust. I want to find a companion. She was that companion. But I've missed my chance, and I don't think I'll ever get another one.

What's there to be happy about? Why be happy if I can't share my experiences with anyone? Why would I do anything at all? Why be happy if I can't laugh with someone, can't feel a sense of affection, can't feel loved? Things I found fun a couple months ago I don't like doing anymore. Why would I do anything? I don't blame anyone for what I'm going through, though. It's all a result of my introversion and me being fuckin autistic. I'm but unwanted garbage at parties -- the only thing I do is sit in a corner and stare at the ground grumpily.

I want everything back. I have so many memories that remember me of those times. It wasn't even that long ago, but the rate at which it is starting to torment me, is increasing. I have become more sensitive to crying at random times, I can't be happy. I feel like I'm sinking deeper and deeper. And I don't think I can get out of it anytime soon.

If you came this far, thanks for reading.

Also, I've probably missed a lot of things. If you have any questions, I will try to answer them.",0
133,"When I say losing my friend, I mean that I feel he's drifting away from me.

I didn't really plan on posting here, but when I tried commenting on r/AskReddit on a post about ""How do you really feel"" this stuff kept pouring out of me so I thought I should post it on somewhere more appropriate. I think that this belongs here, but if it doesn't please point me to the right direction.

I've been struggling with dark thoughts, depression and quite honestly, self-loathing for years. I've felt that way since I was in high school to the time I started college.

It was really hard opening up to new people and I still struggle with it, but I managed to make some pretty good friends and one really great friend.

I've recently realised that when we were hanging out, I didn't have those feelings anymore. I was feeling so good that I didn't feel that way even when I was alone. I'd very rarely get depressed and it would only be about the stuff I had to do for college that stressed me out. I wouldn't feel like I was worthless though anymore. I started to get some confidence back and do things I wanted because I wasn't beating myself down all the time thinking I'm completely worthless and that nobody likes me.

I like to think that all my new friends helped in that. At first, I'd be anxious when I was about to meet them. I was afraid that I'd say something stupid or that they didn't really like me. But now even if I'm not feeling great, if I'm with them I feel alright, I feel like everything's going to be okay.

The one great friend I made though had the most impact on me. The way we met was like destiny or something. There were so many consequences and things we had in common. We were the first person that each other met when we started college in a completely unknown city for both of us. We've done quite a lot of things independently from the rest of our friends and we've bonded a lot over these years. I used to think I'd never have anyone else as close as my childhood friends, but now I consider him to be as close to me as they are/were.

To be honest, I think I've helped him quite a lot too. I've always tried to be there for him when he was having problems, I tried to give him courage when he needed to face a challenge and I've always listened when he needed to talk to someone about his problems. He doesn't really know the good impact he had on me, because he doesn't really do those things, but he's still a good friend in his way.

Recently though I think some of my actions have been quite wrong and I have disappointed him. That, combined with the fact that he has made a new friend that he spends a lot of time with has made me feel that something has changed. Like we're not that close anymore. He talks less to me and arranging stuff without me. I can't help but feel like there's some distance between us now. I can't really describe it. Maybe because it can't be put into words. It's just that ""feel"" of something being wrong that you get from people you know very well, you know? 

It just hurts so much. My friends mean everything to me and even the idea of losing my best friend or even worse that he has replaced me with someone else tears me apart. All those feelings of self-loathing, anxiety, fear and sadness are back, just when I thought I was finally rid of them.

I know that the fact that those feelings being away was dependent on a different person is probably not a very good thing. I think it means that at some point they would come back. But the idea of losing him was bound to create a big problem for me because we are (I like to think we still are) very close. I don't expect losing a person that feels like a brother to not have that result, even to people that weren't feelings those things before. I think it's a reasonable reaction.

I'm just really lost and sad. I feel like crying, but I can't. I don't know what to do. If I share those thoughts with him I might even make things worse. All I know is I don't want to lose my friend and I hate feeling this way. I want to overcome this and I want things to be back to the way they were. That's my driving force for now.

I don't know if anyone will read this or comment on it, but even just writing things down and reading them again has been helpful. I just need someone to talk to about this and even if nobody responds, it feels like someone is listening even though that might not be the case.",0

136,"So, I'm not about to tell you my whole life story because honestly I can't even remember it that well and I might me biased to think I've been mistreated by everyone.
In summary: mom and dad got divorced when I was 4 or 5, went to live with my mom, then my dad won my guardianship.
The thing with my mom is: when I was a kid she would go to work on her boyfriend's bar and leave me alone at home every single night. At some point we even lived at the back of the bar. The other thing is I heard them have sex every night. 
The thing with my dad is that he got married again and they kinda forgot I existed, he would come home from work, have dinner with his wife and they wouldn't invite me, I felt like I wasn't home (he also constantly told me I was too fat) On top of that he wouldn't let me see my friends, I was to go to school and straight back home, even if I had classes all day, I was supposed to come home for lunch. At home I had nothing to do, most of the time I was grounded because my grades weren't good and my room was messy.
His wife was also not that great either, I tried to kill myself once when they weren't home, so since I was grounded, my dad called me when they got back and asked where I was, I told him I was at the hospital and a few minutes later they got there, he asked me why I did ""such a stupid thing"", I responded ""because I wanted to"" and she just left and went home, dad didn't care much either but stayed with me until they stitched me up.
After highschool my dad had never considered the possibility of me not going to college, so I did. I spent 4 years doing something I hated (don't get me wrong, my GPA was 8,4/10) but I just hated it and the thought of having to do that for the rest of my life)
In the meantime (I was living with my mom) I started dating someone for the first time, and around the same time my mom got a boyfriend too, so she went to live with her new boyfriend. So I was in my first relationship at 18, living alone and depressed.
So now here we are, I left college with 6 months left until graduation, I don't have a job or friends, can't tell my dad the truth and my mom is just a terrible choice to ask for advice.
I blame what happened to me for not knowing who I am, I never had any say in any of this and now I not only don't know how to make decisions for myself, but I also don't know what I would like to do. I've been at home doing nothing for about 8 months now and I feel overwhelmed over anything. Specially that I don't have a job and very expensive bills to pay, my dad gives me money every month and my mom was supposed to help but doesn't, and my dad wants me to find a job so he can stop sending money, and I don't know what to do.",0
137,"Hi All. I have a very close friend who has been spiraling downward over the past year and a half. He always had a bit of a dark and pessimistic side, and then he got in a toxic relationship with a girl who used him and his money and then moved on to a younger, hotter guy. That was a year and a half ago and he is still miserable. Every event or gathering he hijacks conversations to talk about how miserable he is. He cries at the bar and breaks down. We try to tell him he needs to seek professional help but he just won't listen. It's at the point where none of us want to invite him anywhere because nothing is fun when he's around. He's a close friend so we know that despite those frustrations we could never abandon him, but at this point it seems selfish for him to not get help and continue to unload on all of us without any intention of ever getting help.

&amp;#x200B;

We decided that maybe we should attempt an intervention of sorts but we want to do it the right way (if there is a right way). Should we only include 4-5 of his closest friends or should we do an 'all hands on deck' scenario? Should we write down a letter and read them like you see in other interventions? Any suggestions or resources would be great. I'm sorry if this is not the correct place for this post.",0
138,"I’ve always struggled with depression, since I was 15 but now I’m 24 and the past 2 years has RIPPED me apart mentally. And just the past 5 months, it’s gotten worse. I have the drive, motivation and interest to do things and go places but my brain and body don’t follow? I allow anxiety to take over and make me think about all of the reasons I shouldn’t go out or should just stay home. I haven’t seen my friends more than twice in these 4 months. My boyfriend lives with me, and hes the only friendly face I talk to. I haven’t left my house by myself in a long time. I go out for a little but come back. I suffer from extreme body dysmorphia and is ALOTTT of the reason i dont go out. I think im too fat and people are looking at me.

I also dont like when people look at me for an extended amount of time, i feel like they’re thinking about how ugly or stupid i am. I’ve made some lifestyle changes to maybe help with my depression and it did for a week. Now im here again, not leaving my house.

139,"To start, a history about my mental health. My mother has a slew of things, ranging from depression, to schizophrenia. My mother's parents and family have a history of depression. My dad's side of things include suicide. From my early ages, one of my greatest struggles was fear of social interactions. I was later diagnosed with avoidant personality disorder and it pretty much runs my life to this day.

I have major depressive disorder, social anxiety, blah blah, but mostly what I'm prescribed is nothing more than antidepressants. I've never had any real luck and I've been on dozens of them, but it's all I've ever been prescribed.

Anyway, fast forward to today. I've been without a job for a while and now my family of 5 is on bare bones. My wife is disabled. I'm 38 and she's 35. She had an injury from her teenage years that has taken all the cartilage from her knee and she's now almost unable to walk. When we met this wasn't an issue.

I'm very educated. I have tons of awards. 4.0 GPA in college, but I couldn't finish because my loans ran out. I was in honors everything in HS and was put into special programs like Gifted &amp; Talented. Valedictorian, top 10% of US students. I could go on. Anyway, I'm jobless now and I've been doing tons of interviews lately. I work in the IT field and I'm most often told I'm overqualified and wouldn't last because I'd get bored. I mean I guess that makes sense when I'm applying for helpdesk roles. It doesn't help when I tell the interviewer about AI I've written, or how I use image recognition in gaming that doesn't need to edit memory so it's not a true ""hack"" per-se and there's nothing on the market like it. Yet I also don't really qualify for a developer role either, since I have no professional experience, only personal. I know I'm not senior level, I just want a chance...

The very best thing about myself is constantly under attack at every interview. Computers are what I know and I've studied since the era of Windows 3.1. What sucks is when I tell them how much I rely on the command prompt and my typing speed and they ask, ""But are you proficient in a Windows environment?"" Jesus... Are you saying I can tear apart games, find pointers, do AOB scans, write LUA, write machine learning, script my scripts, but I've no experience in Windows? Technical recruiters are a joke.

Anyway, I had two interviews today. First was at 1PM, second at 5PM. I'm broke and live 30 miles from the city, so I sat in my car from 2PM (after the first interview with one company) until 4:45PM with second company. Is this not dedication?

I almost cried during the interview. He said he didn't think the roles I'd be given would challenge me enough and I'd want to leave because it wasn't complex enough. I shouldn't have said this, but I said it doesn't matter, because I'll do anything at this point to keep food on the table, and I could promise I wouldn't leave the company for at least a couple of years because I would want to pay back my appreciation for being hired.

What I really wanted to say was... If I don't get a job soon, my family (wife and three kids) will be homeless soon. I cannot handle that and I already have a suicide method planned and waiting for when I hit the complete bottom. I'm incredibly talented and I want an outlet to display this at. I've never met anybody who types as quickly as I do or has the weird unique skills I do. Even though my disassembly of games is of no value to any company, I just want them to realize how far I push myself. Nobody realizes this. My thirst of knowledge is not profitable to a company, and that's the only thing that matters.

I'm starting to break apart. I almost cried during the interview (it lasted two hours... weird...). Well, I guess I didn't start to break apart as I'm already pretty broken. Because of my problems that I cannot tell employers, it's leading to another problem. I have huge social anxiety. Last time I worked in a call center, I attempted suicide and was hospitalized for over a week. Now, there's no more applications left to put in on Indeed, and my recruiter is now looking into call center jobs for me. I'm about to possibly be put back into something that made me try to kill myself. Right now, I'm close to it anyway, but I promised my wife I absolutely wouldn't...

Regardless, I continue to isolate myself more and more. I can't help it... Even why my family tries to interact with me, I have no feelings; I just want to be left alone. If I drink, I finally become sociable, but then it hurts my family. I get two choices: drink and feel normal and sociable, or don't drink and isolate. Neither is good, and with money tight right now, I can't even drink to get away from the pain.

I don't have family (my own or in-laws) to rely on, either for financial or emotional support. I isolate myself so much that I have no friends. Even when I had friendly co-workers, outside of work I'd avoid calls from them... Really, right now I should be hospitalized, but then I couldn't look for jobs and do interviews, etc...

I really, really, really want help right now. Don't be alarmed if I don't reply... It's, again, my fear of being social and how I'm viewed.",0

Today something bad happened and I feel the episodes are returning. Everything is coming back to my 5 years of depression in college. My bad gpa, my lack of confidence everything. And what is the point of even trying if everything is gonna be blocked because I was fucking sick? People who never wanted to off themselves will never understand. I wanted to off myself and I was so sure I was gonna make it that I left behind everything. And now it's coming back. ",0
143,"The longest I’ve ever held a job has been two and a half years, my current position. 

It’s the best job I’ve ever (and likely will ever) have. I work from home as a tech support chat manager, make $15.50 an hour, on a 10AM-7PM schedule.

And yet, I’m depressed and miserable, taking days off work because I’m not strong enough to cope. I go into work everyday feeling that I’m wasting nine hours of my life sitting at a desk, not contributing anything of value to the world, getting anxiety having to type for hours talking to 2-3 people simultaneously and relying on customer surveys to determine if I’ll have a job next month or not.

I do this EVERY TIME. I’m happy to have new job, then the pointlessness of it, the hours I’m wasting away, the asses I have to kiss to get ahead drives me to either quit or get myself fired. This has been my life since I was eighteen. I’ve suffered from this depression for fourteen years. Working makes my depression spiral into a black hole. I abruptly took time off because I was becoming increasingly erratic with my emotions and having thoughts of suicide on a daily basis.

It’s become THAT bad. I’ve been on leave from my job for a month and stuck in this depressive rut, unable to even get my mind in the right place to go back. I’m letting my poor husband down. He works so hard for me and has been supportive of me seeking help and getting on medication during my leave, and here I am, again, ruining our financial situation because I’m too...whatever I am...to keep a job.

I feel like a loser. A failure. I’m beating myself up about it because I’m ruining what will be the best job I’ve ever had, and letting myself and my husband down. I don’t know what to do. I just need someone to talk to, to make me feel that something will work out. Or maybe I’m just asking for a miracle.

I’ve been trying so hard to research business ideas, niches, things I can sell from home that allow me to use my creative strengths to earn a good living, to do something that will give me purpose and meaning. The only time I’ve felt this way is when I was selling. It sounds stupid, I know, but posting things online, having someone interested buy it, listing things for sale was exciting! That’s what I truly enjoy. 

But until I find the right opportunity, I’m stuck in this black hole of feeling worthless, broke, and depressed, disappointing myself and my family with my unreliability. It’s not right that I’ve taken so much time off, neglecting bills, wallowing...but I’m just, stuck. 

I feel like the only one who feels this way. I just don’t know what to do.

144,"Seriously feel stuck, like i cant make a move. Struggling with every decision. I want to move out, but cant because my mum relies on me a little, and we have 2 dogs, who are old.

I  want to go to Australia to visit my brother. Sisters dont want me to go. Probably because they know ill only be coming back to apply for a permanent visa. 

I feel like im stuck in quick sand and everybody else is soaring like a fucking eagle. I saw a picture on the internet, probably Facebook, the whole picture is underwater and there is one person who seems to be sinking into the darkest, deepest waters. Thats how I feel everyday. 

&amp;#x200B;

There was a moment a while back where i was thinking about my family and how it looks, 2 boys, my brother and myself, and my younger sister. My brother is the oldest, then me, then my sister. But to me it feels like they wanted a boy and a girl, they just kept trying until they got the girl they wanted. Was i wanted? I cant ask that question. No parent would tell the truth. 

&amp;#x200B;

My brother is the family man, who wants the kids and the garden with constant contact with the extended family. He is the favourite. Everybody is the family enjoys having him around.

My sister is a strong, independent woman. She really doesnt need anybody, but being a woman, has her circles. The family loves her because she is strong. 

&amp;#x200B;

Then there is me, a loser, failure, and a disappointment. I feel my friends dont care for me. I thought my leaving old job would spur me on to make more moves forward in my life, but im stuck again.

&amp;#x200B;

I thought Scotland with my ex would have been good for me, thinking we would see out the 6 month contract, save loads of money, but that failed. Then Newcastle, my failing to get a job hit me hard. I lost my smile, my joy, my ... spark. I started to sink again, but this time is didnt feel like the slow quick-sand. This was a rapid decent, like free falling from a plane. It was horrible, i'd let my family down, her down, and myself down too. 

&amp;#x200B;

Now ... the water is all around me, sharks are circling. It feeling like im fighting a losing battle against the current.

Maybe I should give up, close my eyes and sink. 

&amp;#x200B;

I just need to find a way to get out of this debt. Work is a very slow process, each day is as long as time itself. But that seems to be the only thing going at the moment. The crappy minimum wage job that a 10 year old can do. Its so degrading.

145,Just found out my ex is dating another person really soon after the breakup.  I didn’t really expect that to happen and I want to try and be happy for her but it’s so damn hard.  So much for her using this year to be alone and grow I guess.  At this point I’ve gone through too many heartbreaks that I feel like maybe I’m better off alone.  At least I won’t hurt from others anymore.  It feels like I could disappear now and no one would care anyways.  ,0
146,"I've always had wanderlust, and a desire to see things and do things out of the ordinary. Recently, things have been extremely tough for me and I'm thinking there's only a few ways out of this mess. Maybe some insight is what I need. I'll try to keep this short and sweet.

Details about my city - It is in shambles. Hypocrites, narcissists and criminals have made this city home, and I want to get away from it. And I'm not just saying that because I want to run; it really is a degenerate's playground. The environment and the people that live here are incredibly toxic. Even our mayor is under FBI investigation. The streets are filthy and of course, there are some wonderful areas but they often become overcrowded with beggars and gangs. Every night, you can hear gunshots and police sirens just outside your window.

Details about me - A year ago, I deleted all of my social media because I had an incident with revenge porn that left me shattered, and I didn't want people to find me online. Everyone in my high school at the time was sharing the pictures, and the comments would make you sick. I still walk into a room two years later and the thoughts consume me - ""Have you seen me naked?"" I was distraught and contemplated suicide for a while. The separation from social media certainly helped my overall mental health, and I have no desire to ever go back. I have lived in the present a little more, and have worked more towards maintaining healthy friendships. Deleteing Facebook made me appreciate the world, and those that have really impacted me.

You should know that I've been suffering for years, and my issues have been made worse after I was targeted. I have bipolar disorder, a monster of an eating disorder, PTSD from a sexual assault in my youth, anxiety (social), depression and basically, I'm a walking disaster. I carry myself with a smile constantly, though. I am warm and approachable with an incredible sense of humor. I am selfless and charitable. You wouldn't know that I'm teetering on the edge. I have no friends because I'm terrified of being close to anyone due to the revenge porn (they're making the rounds online again as of two weeks ago, and guess who's been crippled because of it?) and truthfully, nobody strikes me as being worth the effort. I am ironically hugely into motivational speakers and bettering yourself and finding peace in nature, hiking, etc. And I couldn't surround myself with people that I can't trust. Which is everyone. Because after a messy breakup with a best friend who claimed he browsed revenge porn sites for the thrill of recognising girls he knows, I feel I can't trust anyone. Especially men around my age.

Details about the situation - My uncle lives up here and he's cool. My mom fled domestic abuse and lives in the deep South. We don't talk much, and I have a deep resentment for her. And my father is nonexistent. The only person that keeps me here is my boyfriend. He's a good man. And I mean that. He is honestly one of the best people I have ever come to know. Leaving him is going to destroy what's left of me.

He's tried to get me into therapy and counselling and I failed at that because I can't trust the therapist enough to open up. Instead, I lie, which isn't helping anyone. He's trying so hard but I just want to GO. Run. And without social media or anything, the people harassing me with revenge porn won't find me, old aquanitances won't find me, nobody will find me. I just need to make the choice. Start over somewhere brand new and become the woman I KNOW I can be.

They say that your environment can impact your health and the city I'm living in is toxic. I don't want to run away and don't see it that way - I see it as an opportunity to restart and make peace with all of the pain I've endured. I have about 10k in cash, which isn't much but it's more than nothing. I have a Jeep that has enough space to comfortably sleep in for a short woman. I have very little belongings, no debts, no commitments other than a decent job and a boyfriend I know I'll regret losing. And an itch to get out of here.

I don't have a plan and don't want one. I just want to drive and get the *** out of here and become who I really am without fear of nude pictures disgracing me and shutting me down. What do you think, Reddit?",0

After a date, if the girl doesn't respond back or stops talking then I get more depressed, this happened 3 times in past couple of months. I have started smoking, the thing that I hated most as a child because my dad died when I was a child because of it. When I am alone I constantly think about dying. I haven't achieved anything that I set out to achieve by the time I got 26. I bought ps4, a bike thinking that would make me happy but it didn't. I started gym thinking if I look good, it would make me happy but it didn't, I lost a lot of weight and I am not fat anymore but going to gym seems like a chore, but I still go there. The only reason I haven't committed suicide yet is because of my mother. I always hope that I die in some accident. When I am on a plane, I think that if plane crashes, it would be over now.

It's a funny thing that I constantly find myself coming back here at my weirdest moments. A few days ago I had to leave my beautiful California and return to Washington for the last quarter of the year. Things were fine at first, but alas I find myself broken again.

I don't really know what happened, I just woke up one day and the sparkle of life was gone again. However, I don't really have anyone to talk to anymore. I've used up all my coupons at this point. My girl gets worried sick, I hear the exhaustion in my sister's voice when she tells me once again to see my therapist (it's expensive as hell), and seeing the same old sad face on my friends' expressions when I talk is just heartbreaking.

169,"I want go be apart of a statistic that people pretend to fight for/ care about.

My fiancé and I are in a place of total helplessness, dismay, and numbness. He only speaks of offing himself after drinking, and its not in a way to threaten or make me feel bad. He feels as if as hard as he tries his efforts wont affect the outcome of any situation. He moved across the country about a year ago to live with me. We live in a seperate building on the same property as my grandparents on my fathers side, my parents and my brother.

     My parents were constanty away form home while I was starting school till I was about 12 years old. They were very hands off when it came to my education but my father ""repermanded me"" with violence and a short fuze. This would consist of him running into a room and pinning me down on a rock indoor slab flooring, similar to smooth cobble stone. He would us wrestling hold that were exicuted with him barely holding back. He would wrap around my neck, hold my arms back and wrap my legs with his. I would be looking up at my mom from the ground screaming with what ever air was left in my lungs, ""I can't breath."" Tapping out on his forearm. She would half scream his name and he would pull on my body 20% harder then slowly relax and get up and walk away as I'm left gasping for air on the ground. This would happen till right before I turned 17 when I stood up to him saying this is concidered assault. Parts of my childhood are black voids of memories, fear, panic attacts, and the first word I learned about psychology from my mother when I was 12, Learned helplessness. My fathers anger did disapate eventually. I do believe I paved the way so my brother woudln't have to endure the same abuse. My mother and I endured for so many years of my childhood.

       I was deamed as the trouble child in the family because my grades weren't acceptable in a family of doctors. Literally a family of doctors. Both of my parents are Radiologist, my grandmother a pharmacist with a ph.d., my aunt a dentist, my grandfather a dentist, my uncle a radiologist, my cousin a lawyer, and my other cousin a veterinarian. They all live realativly close as well so the comparison has been on a regular basis since I was 6 years old. Saying that I struggled in school was an understatement. My early years I had teachers pull me by my arms yell in my face and throw me into a detention hall to write my name, sentences, mathmatical equations every recess for its entirity. This took place from Pre-k till 2nd grade. Through out elementary, middle school, and high school homework consisted of most nights working on 2-3 subjects a night each for 4+ hours. I would still bring only mid to low Bs. This was not acceptable. It wasnt until I was 17, I was diagnosed with ADHD prodominatly non-hyperactive. I managed and created tools on my own to battle it with my severe anxiety and depression.

        My brother who is 7 years younger has been able to have little to no parental intrucivness, and academically supported since he could speak. He has been able to test out of 2 courses. Which allows him to not only be the praised child but grants him the ability to update his computer to a i9 with a 1080ti with the newest processor (about 5,000 dollars build  the month they are released. He was 14/15 at the time, so no arguments that he had a job to obtain it. He has actually told me that jobs at resturaunts, fast food joints, and minimum wage jobs as a whole are beneth him. There are a total of 3 computers in his room. Only one tier lower than his ""main"" build. 
      When I asked for the older build he wasnt using anymore, he said I had to pay for it. It was worth at the maximum 230 dollars case and all according to my older cousin and most websites. (5 to 6  years old build) He demanded 1,000 dollars at first, then 800 when I mentioned a payment plan. I told him 800 was ridiculous, but swore it was worth it. After setting it up in my room me agreeing to giving him 200 dollars (which I did) he would later go into my car,purse,  and wallet and steal 380 extra dollars. My grandmother said that he told her I owed him money. When I yelled about it and screamed saying he stole it she defended him and said, ""Im too old to be picking fights with him."" This was the common theme with my grandmother, grandfather, and my father.

          When I confront my mother about his speanding habits of my parents money she yells or has my father yell at me to say,""That none of your concern/you're not his parent/you should be worrying about yourself."" 
After attending college, I was blamed for a 34,000 dollar monthly credit card bill. When I was accused I yelled at my father saying ""LOOK AT THE CHARGES, LOOK AT MY CARD HISTORY! PROVE ME WRONG THAT IS NOT ME!"" I didnt hear from my father about it again. But what I heard from my mother was 20,000 dollars were spent on items for my fathers AV buisness. (He does it on the side) and 10,000 was spent on my tuition payment and grocceries. That 4,000 was all demed purchases my brother made. My parents at the time, along with all the other employees, were let off because the hospital embessed money and went bankrupt.

               I at the time was also recovering from psychosis. It was caused from going 9 days without sleep, 5-7 without sustainable amounts of food and water, whilst previously recovering from a neck injury, and going cold turkey with: birthcontrol, depression medication, adhd medication, pain medication, and sleep medication. (Side note I was perscribed depression med. and adhd meds for over 2 years, and I stopped each of these months apart from eachother.) This happened before my first semester of exams of college. I was able to email my professors maraculoisly weeks before and during my psychois that I had a neck injury and was having trouble day to day. I was granted a medical leave and retured to pass all but 1 exam. Mind you I was deamed to having PTSD, residual hallucinations, and severe paranoia from the experience the psychiatric hospital helped expose me too. My psychologist of many years explained to me I was worse off after than I was the day upon entering.

This was 4 years ago and while my psychiatrist says that its a myrical I recovered cognitively to anypoint that I'm currently at, I have little to no retention of new subject matter in school, and day to day. Abstract concepts continue to trip me up and I constantly wonder what part of me mentally will be contorted/washed. My personality has changed, I used to keep more to myself and take time to perfectly analyze and craft what I would say and information i would retain. Now I'm quick to anger, and feel that I shallowly  thinking of how to phrase my sentences verbally and how to critically think through problems thrown at me. 
My fiancé has too endured psychosis a year before we met that too as situationally provoked.

    Jobwise, I currently work with my fiancé doing graphic design. My previous job was one I worked hard for. I would make melts, and subs, prep the condoments, cleaned the chicken, cooked the chicken, make chicken/ tuna salad, made yogurt fruit cups, took orders, and did dishes. This was all done within one 8 hour shift, no breaks. Yes legally I didnt realize this was illegal till I quit. I quit due to an employee 2 years my junior. She had worked there 3 years and was considered my shift manager when the GM was gone and the boss clocked out. She would steal things out of charity vending machines, blame me for not working fast enough, and try to rope me into doing her work and mine. The best part of all of this is that we had a drive up window (no speaker system) and had only 2-3 people working the entire location. We had another employee who was a year younger than me and 2 months in was offered more of a wage. He he ate food during shifts and would play dumb to shoved all closing/cooking/customer responsibilty to me to leave early or be on his phone. This was all for a $7.50/hr wage. Thanks to my fiancé, I developed some amount of self respect and self worth. I finally question the world and environment I grew up in thanks to him. 
    But, he too has slowly become consumed by the helplessness this place forces you to endure. This culture that pushes for lack of your rights to individual thinking and unquestioning attitude. This stunted environment.
This molding nightmare.
This... hell.

173,"**This is a vent, I honestly don't know to feel so maybe giving my thoughts could help others.**

I know it probably wont interest a lot of you but I'll give you a quick introduction on who I am and what I do so you can understand. 

I am 18, and currently do YouTube/Social Networking full time as my line of work. I also work part time as a NSFW Audio Voice Actor and I do smutty and/or comforting audios for people that needed it. 

*I have been to therapy however, while I have gotten better I still feel fucking terrible.*

I live alone in my small 600 square ft. condo and I haven't seen my mother with the exception of one or two times every other week, both my parents pay for said condo while they live in other places. My mother left to go live with new boyfriend while my father lives alone in a city near mine. 

I rarely eat, and when I do eat I usually just puke it up because I am deathly afraid of gaining weight. 

Over the last 5 months I have been beat over the head over and over again by life (or at least it feels like it.)

I was accused of being a pedophile and lies were sent out to my fans by an abusive friend/sexual harasser of mine, and I have gained PTSD (self-diagnosed) like symptoms from the insane amounts of harassment/death threats from friends and said group who tried to ""expose me"". 

I've created such an incredible fandom and following with supporters from all across the globe, I have an incredible girlfriend who loves me **so dearly**, and I have so many great people in my life. 

How is it though that I feel so **alone.** 

Why do I have to feel bored about everything and anything? 

Why does my huge amounts of creativity have to just **disappear.**

How come I feel like the people around me are untrustworthy?

Everything feels so dirty, and nothing feels clean.

I feel not only tainted by life... But taken, abused, and throat f*cked into another realm of existence.

I don't know what to do. I'm so pitifully sad and just screwed up right now it hurts.

179,"Hi, long story short I moved house and needed meds for Jan thru April because they had a 3-4 month wait at the psych doc I got an appt at. He did prescribe my existing meds for Jan, Feb, and March, but come April he says he cannot. I take Effexor and Rexulti; he sent in the Efxr but says he wont do the Rexulti, which I can't afford since I recently lost insurance and it would be $1k+, nor would he provide Abilify which is a similar drug that I have taken before and tolerated well and would cost $25.

So I have no insurance and no meds. Is there any good reason why they are being so restrictive? I can never speak to the doctor, only the front desk. How can I get the meds I need?

190,"First off this isn't a how to beat depression post. I still feel like shit on a daily basis. But these are some tips that helped me see some light in life and keep the suicidal tendencies at bay. And if they helped me they might just help someone else.

1. **Physical Activity:** First off this isnt a quick natural fix to depression like so many claim it is. But i force myself to walk my ass to the gym 3 days a week and do my sets of 5 reps for squat, bench, and deadlift. It wont make u instantly feel better. At first youl probablly feel like your wasting your time. But just getting yourself there is the hardest step. Noones telling you to go all out, but even if you do a few basic lifts youl gain a sense of pride as your numbers improve over time. If lifting weights isnt your thing, do sets of pullups/pushups/dips, things like that, and try get more done every time. Or just jog. start with a mile or two and gradually work your way up to longer distances. The point is to see the improvement over time and eventually have that improvement as something to look forward to. At the very least, you feel like your doing SOMETHING because I know most days i would feel like im doing absolutely nothing and going nowhere.
2. **Cold Showers:** This is the number one thing that built my willpower when i couldnt even muster up the energy to walk the dog or go to the grocery store, even make breakfast. Every morning i set my timer and take a shower on the coldest setting. Started at 3 minutes and increased in increments of 30 seconds. Am currently at 6 minutes every day. without this I wouldnt have the willpower to do any of the other things on this list.
3. **Talk to people:** Dont have to have an active social life because I know with severe depression thats impossible. But simple things. If your in class talk to people that sit around you. Make small talk with cashiers. say hi to strangers on the street. Just try to make small talk with someone a couple times a day.
4. **Stay out of your head:** This is the hardest one and basically everything else on the list is mainly to help with this. Do absolutely everything possible to not get caught in those negative thought loops. When you feel like laying in bed or sitting on the couch all day stuck in your negative feelings do absolutely anything to get out of your head. Take a walk, put on a song, SOMETHING. or just make it a point not to think about anything.
5. **Dont get caught in the past or the future.** ties in with the last one. Took me a long time to move on from being stuck in the past and obsessing over better days. On the flip side theres the overwhelming fear that life is passing by and the futures bleak and hopeless. Life is happening right now, no matter how horrible things seem, best thing you can do for your mental health is live in the present moment and try and find something, no matter how small, that makes life tolerable.
6. **Determine to feel a little stronger every day.** Even if its just by a tiny increment. Have a stronger attitude every single day. Even if its barely noticeable. Doesnt mean things will actually get any better. But it all starts with that change in mindstate. When i really fixed my mind on this concept it made a world of difference
7. **Find ways to fill your time.** Not all your time, but something consistent. For example, walk the dog at a certain time every day, have a gym schedule, go swimming, enroll in a class or something. Go to church on Sundays if your religous at all. Anything that forces you to get up and do something.
8. **Get your sleep schedule on track.** Wake up and go to bed the same time every day. And get a solid 8 hours of sleep, but not too much more then that.
9. **Eat Breakfast.** One of the hardest things for me to do personally is force myself to eat breakfast in the morning. But your body and brain need to nutrition. try eat something high in proteins and and healthy fats rather then toast/cereal.

&amp;#x200B;

Now im well aware that these things are much easier said then done. Also their most likely not going to cure your depression. 6 months ago any of these things felt absolutely impossible for me, but it all started with baby steps until I got all of the things on the list. Key was dedication and consistensy. Like i said, I still struggle on a daily basis and most days feel bleak and hopeless. But on the other hand I think about suicide considerablly less, I find myself enjoying small moments now and then, I feel glimmers of hope and I feel considerablly stronger and more equipped to deal with my depression then I did 6 months ago. So if it helped me just putting it out there and hope it can help someone else.",0

193,"I hate the way I look. My face is rough and masculine, but not in an attractive way. I look like a thug, someone you'd expect to see waiting to kidnap a small child or stalk you in an alleyway at night.

I look like a criminal, a rapist, a pedophile. Someone who belongs in jail. My resting face is not friendly at all, and my smiles look fake or forced. This is a complete contrast to how I actually am. I'm a geeky guy. I like things like anime, video games, superhero movies. Childish things. My appearance doesn't match my interests or personality at all.  


No one wants to be around me because of how I look. I had someone tell me that I look scary. At a part time job, one girl thought I was creepy and went around telling everyone not to talk to me. I'm only 27 and the realization is starting to sink in that there's nothing I can do to change this. I'm overweight, but even when I was thin it was still the same. The problem lies in the structure of my face and other features that cannot be changed.

197,"My mother has mentally abused me since I can remember. 
The things she has said to me have mentally crippled me.
I will recall as many as I can, most of these are the ones that play in my head everyday.

In  2017 my grandmother got pneumonia, my mother and I sat next to her in the ER and I brought up how I was afraid that my thyroid may be making me infertile (My mothers side suffers with Thyroid conditions, my grandmother had hers removed and my cousin currently has thyroid cancer. He is one year younger than me, I am 27) the nurse in the room with us perked up her ears when she heard me talk about my thyroid. My mother turned to me and told me loudly to ""Tell someone who cares"" the nurse looked horrified and shuffled out of the room. 

Thats just one thing that has stuck with me.  If I ever am diagnosed with a terminal illness, no one will be telling her. 

Here is another crippling thing she has said on multiple occasions. 

If I was to ever get pregnant she would kill my child and me. She has threatened to kick it out of my stomach. (I havent got children, nor do I think I will ever be able to have any) my father doesnt care that she says these things. He enables her shitty behaviour towards me. Might I add I am an only child. 

My grandmother tells me my parents never wanted a child, so I am confused about my existence aswell. 
I have always light heartedly told both of my parents they should have aborted me, but deep down I actually think I would of been better off aborted. They both have always said that when I was born that if I was to come out with some dissability they were going to adopt me out. 
I was diagnosed with ADHD at the age of 4 and was on medication up until I was 16.  
I have always been treated like I am under the age of 5, that I dont know anything and im repeatedly told my brain is a peanut.  

I remember the first time I had ever gotten my period, I was 10 and I knew goddamn nothing about my body and I bled through my undies. When I asled my mother what was happening to me she told me I was a ""Disgusting little bitch"" and she threw a packet of pads at me and told me to change myself, I was given no instructions and had no idea what was happening to me until I sat in my room weeping while trying to read the instructions and information on the pad packet. 

I have written a spoken word poem about my mother that I read to a cafe on mothers day 2018, If you want to me to post it I will. 

Im sorry that this post is such a mess, please forgive me. Im sorry about how long this is and Im sorry I didnt know where else to share my experiences at.

198," I am 18 years old as well as a senior in highschool. I have had depression for many years but usually doesn't effect me as much but lately I have been especially down in the dump but I'm not exactly sure why or how to get out of this stump. I am usually okay on the outside and can distrsct mysellf but my mood is awful, and motiviation is lacking I just wanna be home alone, and be left alone. 

 Lately I have been dealing with financial aid, high school is ending I have to sign up for college. I'm also struggling with getting a job, I'm so broke. I feel like a loser stuck at a dead end. I hate waking up everyday, and perpetually going through a never ending cycle of hell. I have never been so unmotivated in my life even though highschool is just about over. My mom is bipolar manic that I cannot stand living with any longer but feel guilt, and bad for leaving soon as she is in remission from her issues, I still connect her to past trauma. I feel trapped with no hope I have the lowest expectations to refuse getting dissapointed from people, or situations it's just such a morale killer. I am waiting to move out start a new chapter of life get a job but it all seems to not be happening so many months of applying walk ins and false promises, and I just keep fucking it up.

 I am so tired of trying, I cant try anymore I just want sleep, dealing with so much this week, and school absolutely doesn't help. I can't get therapy due to being absolutely broke with no coverage, I have a mentor which is simmilar but I can't really completely open up to about this to this extent. I also talk to my girlfriend about this stuff but I cannot bounce out of it this time.

My sister while ruining my living situation also ruined my job promotion (we worked for same company separate locations) which in turn ruined the job.  I own a single pair of heels (they happen to be irreplaceable) that this puppy destroyed along with my new knife set I got for Christmas (didn’t open it for months bec it’s like the 3rd nicest thing I own and I wanted them to stay nice) got stuck with a puppy I didn’t want or ask for and can barely afford but that’s cool. I’m in a ton of debt and I have no degree and am virtually unemployable now unless I work in fast food which was detrimental to my mental health. I have 3 friends that I talk to maybe once a month. I have a fiancé but he just doesn’t understand how hard everything is for me now. I thought I had my entire life planned out but people keep ruining everything for me. And I wanna take some responsibility for it but I literally am not to blame for anything, like I stay up at night and think about decisions I made that weren’t necessarily wrong choices they just led me to people who only wanted to hurt me. For example if i just tried harder at my job and got the promotion a year before like I was promised and if I just didn’t care that the new management wanted me to start over all the work I put into my promotion, if I just started over then and really focused on moving up instead of giving up I’d probably be a manger right now. then none of this would’ve happened. I have no purpose, 10% of my belongings, no real job, no higher education, an apartment that’s probably illegal to rent out because it’s not livable and a major safety and health hazard, I have thousands of dollars of debt to catch up on and worst of all is the car part. That cat is the only reason I didn’t kill my self 5 years ago and to have someone take him from me and not even know if I’ll ever be able to get him back is terrible. I just wanna stop existing and not have to care about anything anymore bec I just hate my miserable existence.

I just wanna know I’m not alone and that it gets better and I can turn it around, I wanna get my life back to how it was when it was at least tolerable and not literally painful to have to wake up everyday.

215,"sorry ahead of time for poor format, grammar, and if i don’t capitalize my ‘i’s, i’m on mobile

(17, F) I was diagnosed with major depressive disorder when i was 14 and i’ve never gotten better since then, just short bouts of worse depression. Not long after i was diagnosed with anxiety and ended up going to a PHP for a few months before returning to full-time work and full-time school. About a year later I quit my full-time job and mostly dropped out of school. That was July 2018. A few months ago PTSD was added to my diagnosis after meeting a new psychologist. That’s about it for my mental medical history up until now.

I live with my boyfriend and his grandparents in the lower level of their duplex (his grandparents occupy the upper level). I don’t go to school most days and I didn’t have a job until now. I stay in bed sleeping, playing on my phone, and very occasionally drawing when i feel up to it. This is my entire life, no exaggeration or cutting on details, this really is all I do all day everyday.

The past few months due to my inactivity I hardly eat, not even a full meal a day, not even snacks. I know this is unhealthy but i feel like for me it works because i don’t need much energy to do nothing all day.

231,"So my uncle(M50) is depressed. He hasn't explicitly said it but it's very obvious. I live with him in my dad's old house (long story). He recently got our of his relationship with his 'wife' (I don't think legally married).. and his kids won't even talk to him anymore because his ex is a manipulative bitch. So yea. He's having a hard time. 

I need advice on how to handle talking to him about the mess... He has always been a pretty messy person. Not just messy but dirty. Living in a gross home causes me a lot of anxiety, frustration, anger etc etc. I can't stand it. I'm usually the one who has to clean it all up because I've been avoiding talking to him about it all. I've been avoiding it because I don't want to cause a fight and I don't want him to think I hate him or am angry with him.. it just has to change. 

Since January I have gone to visit Toronto three times and everytime I've gone I've been nervous to go back home to see what state the house is in since I'm usually away for a week or two. EVERY TIME I've come home to a huge mess everywhere. The kitchen a disaster. Food left out for weeks. Dirt on the floor. Clutter all over the living room. I honestly don't understand how one person can make such an incredible mess. 

This time I came home, it was the last straw. I tried giving him the benefit of the doubt, but after a consistent pattern and also coming home to him smoking in my father home/my childhood home after he had been asked not to, and agreed... I'm done. I have to speak up and say it's not ok. 

Now. What I need advice about, is how to talk to him. Because he's depressed, I have been having a really hard time figuring out how to talk to him about this stuff. I'm sure part of why he's nest is because he just doesn't care about his space anymore because he doesn't care about himself.. I feel bad for him. But I just can't live with it anymore. I don't want to add to his sadness. I don't want to shove things in his face that he already knows. But I also need him to understand how it makes me feel. I don't like feeling nervous to go home and seeing mess and crap every where. 

Any advice or thoughts on the situation would be helpful. I thought it would be helpful to hear from people who may know what he's going through and feeling.. idk. ",0

241,"Hello. My names Ben and I'm really messed up right now.

&amp;#x200B;

I've got low lying anxiety and depression caused by my extended family fucking things up for me. Plus, well this is the main bit;

&amp;#x200B;

I've been on painkillers (codeine, Tramadol, Dihydrocodeine at various times but not all at once) for maybe 3 years now. I was first on Codeine and Tramadol (together) but I could feel my brain starting to go a little crazy on tramadol. So I stopped from a doubled dose, cold turkey, and suffered a fortnight of sever depression. I went to my doc at this stage and she just smiled at me, saying ""oh it'll get better"". It did, but! Holy hell I was apocalyptic. Throughout it all though I had my left over medication just sat right beside me and not once did I consider taking it. I'm proud of that.

&amp;#x200B;

I came off the meds and everything grew brighter. My old self returned. You should see my old self... I can achieve anything. And I sometimes did! 

&amp;#x200B;

But the pain returned. I visited the doc and they put me on Pregablin instead. Now if you don't know about that it's a nerve painkiller that's used for a range of things like anti-anxiety, pain killing, some other things I forgot. But I found it fixed every party of me! Before I said my old self was great, and it is, but it's also sometimes shy. Pregablin fixed that for me. It makes you so confident, it's like being drunk but you're in full control. It's a wonderful energy. However it soon reaches tolerance level and no matter how much you take you can't get that painkilling/anxiety fixing feeling back.

&amp;#x200B;

So I quit that. In time I quit that 3 times over, heh. It was actually easy to come off for me except the final time, where I was an emotional wreck for days.

&amp;#x200B;

But now I'm on dihydrocodeine. I would take it in excess. Twice what I was supposed to. Which is down from what I USED to have (weeks worth of it in a single dose, but lower than what others online take). BUT it's causing me such major depression. For real. I feel down 24/7, sometimes feeling a spark of joy when I wake up. It was a trap. When I first took it I felt good. Then it stopped doing that so I took more. That good feeling never came back. I'd just take it, psychosomatically, in large doses expecting it to make me feel better. But it never did! I'd only feel bad.

&amp;#x200B;

So now like I say I'm reducing my intake. I've calculated that the furthest I've gone without a dose meant I had like half a tablet in my body. When I reach that point my mood doesn't change. But I expect that when I have my next dose that I'm going to feel amazing. Of course I never do.

&amp;#x200B;

this is all so fucked up. Right now I feel like going to the hospital emergency room and confessing all.

249,"I had a head trauma 2 years ago when I fell off a cliff. Broke my leg too. Apparently I found out that I forgot a bunch of stuff about my childhood. I had huge blank spots and really ever since that fall I never thought much of it. Well after finding out from cousins a year ago that I forgot a lot I’ve been connecting a web. It was passive, not much interesting stuff and it was a slow process. However, recently I found a traumatic memory of my dad beating my mom. I already knew he did this shit but it was hard seeing it vividly. 

Being rushed with so many memories of him hurting her at home or in public. Purposely tripping her after altercations or yelling at her. I also remember the screaming and yelling of my sister and him always fighting with more often than not turned physical too.

Usually my sister took out all her anger at me by hurting me. She was angry he never mistreated me. She would give me alcohol to laugh at me and hit me.

I have nightmares now

Also fast forward to literally the day I woke up in the hospital. I made this friend over social media a month back or so. She was a 9th grader while I was a 7th grader. She convinced me to go with her and forget about my current girlfriend; she took advantage of the fact of how mentally unaware I was. She messaged gf1 and told her to fuck off basically. I dated the 9th grader (gf2). gf2 would continually shower me with stuff and I was super happy (memory loss really clouded that trauma i talked about) and then we became semi-sexual. It was rather quick. Eventually she cheated on me, manipulated me into thinking it was my fault and I had to make it up. Fast forward a couple weeks and she’s in my room basically forcing me to have sex with her. I break and let her take control; my first time was not good for me. I was a guy used by a girl and it was a huge blow to me as everybody shunned people like that. I wasn’t “abused” “used” or anything like that, I just didn’t find her “hot enough” according to some friends. I broke up with her shortly after. I was also bullied in school for cheating on the gf1 as she was rather popular.

I was empty and felt like I had no purpose. A kid with no bank of good memories to make times better, only rotten ones left by gf2. A kid broken and afraid. I was bullied relentlessly for being fat, lonely, and weird. A kid who had forgotten himself. I tried suicide and just like everything else: i failed. It was my dad’s turn to have me for the week and unexpectedly he come home early to find his son on the floor dying. He brought me to the hospital and I lied with some bullshit I honestly forgot and I got away with it. I also cut so much I have 48 distinguished self harm scars. However I waited it out

A lot happened since then and ultimately i’m a lot happier. I’ve been with a  new girlfriend for a year now and she’s amazing. I’m at an amazing highschool. I get... decent grades. And although the trauma still hurts a lot I’ve been a lot happier and I’ve made more memories.

Summary is; the trauma sticks forever. I have mental images of a ruined childhood scarred in my brain. I have real scars. I have chronic pain in my legs because my parents couldn’t afford physical therapy and follow-ups. There’s still blank spots in my memory which I suspect to be the good memories.

But that’s the past, the future is what matters. Of course it may haunt you, but you can improve the defense. I have a defense of love and friends. I have the defense of a good therapist. Build one that makes you happy and motivated. Be you and be strong. You all got this. ",0
250,"Throwaway because I know friends know my main account. I woke up this morning at around 10AM to the sound of my mother vomiting. I felt so bad that I didn't go to help her or say anything, but I've never known how to react to stuff like that.

I spend all day online per my usual routine, dulling this pain and hiding myself away from my own family. I'm 20 and unemployed, not in school either.

257,"Some days are harder than others, but that feeling that sinking feeling that washes over you out of nowhere is so debilitating. I can't really explain it when it happens, and I'm not usually thinking about anything particular.

I have things that have gone on in my life that would make anyone depressed I guess, but I don't dwell too much on it. I had testicular cancer in April 2017 and had a testical removed, I've had some massive dental issues I'm in between getting fixed, and the temporary partial I wear feels weird at times. I just moved back home with my parents at 36 for a month after a 7 year break up temporary, till my new place is ready at the end of the month. 

I also detoxed off suboxone (opiate maintenance) after 10 years last July. Didn't realize how depressed months out I get and how hard it be mentally after the physical symptoms went away. My doc has me back on it in micro doses, on an as needed basis and it makes me feel like a failure. Sometimes I go 9 days without it and some weeks I may take it every other day or 3 days in a row. It's a dangerous crutch to play with. Although it is a micro dose compared to what I was on, and pretty much treats severe bouts of depression. I lean on it during stressful times with school I guess, to focus and clear the cobwebs from my brain, regain focus and keep harmful thoughts away. 

My docs plan is to work lamotrogine into the mix as I space the other med out and eventually stop taking it. I'm scared of possible repercussions of withdrawl....however I know it won't be as bad as 10 years at high doses.

A lot of good things financially have happened for me...but my life has def changed a lot in the last 2 months. For now it's been taking things one day at a time in my life to get what I need to get done for that day. Adjusting to the new living situation has gotten me down.

I got bumble to see if I could meet some people out of it but both the people who I have been talking to have gone silent the day or the day before we planned to meet up, and maybe it’s my fault? Maybe I didn’t give them enough attention, or maybe they thought I wasn’t interesting/attractive enough? Idk

And also they guy that I had some feelings for (and is now with my friend which is btw a whole other story) has been real shit to me lately. I thought he was nice but he told me that I have no ass and to shut up when I wasn’t even talking. He also said I was no help when it came to things like projects etc. 

Also my presentation which I had today didn’t go well and I didn’t try hard enough and I did poorly.

I’m probably just wanting someone to tell me it’s okay or some shit, or maybe someone should just tell me that I’m ugly and worthless and I’ll just stop trying.

Tl;dr - I’m feeling pretty worthless and pathetic and unloveable rn ",0
259,"How to deal with depression and get back to your life.

The first step is to accept that you are not where you want to be in life.
Next, you must identify the cause.
For instance, if you are feeling depressed, it is because some aspect of your current state is making you unhappy. 
Wether it be the people you’re surrounded by, your profession, a relationship or yourself, you’ve got to identify the problem. 
Once you’ve put your finger on it, you have to address and fix the issue, this will take time but don’t lose hope.
If it’s got to do with the current circle of people you interact with on a daily basis, move on and cut your losses, you will make new friends. If it’s your own family, speak with them and try to get them to reason with the way they make you feel. Assuming that you’ve tried enough times and it has not worked, save up enough money to move out on your own or move in with a friend. On the occasion that the problem is your girlfriend,spouse or wife, communicate the issue with them and do your best to work it out together. You may also want to get an unbiased third party such as couples therapy to better understand each other without fighting. Supposing that nothing’s worked, it’s time to swallow your feelings and move on, give each other time and focus on your life without them. Your happiness and mental health comes first. You must let go of the fear of not being able to find something better because you will; as it is in the case the problem lies with your profession. Ask your boss for personal time off and explain your situation. Granted that you are still unhappy, I do not recommend quitting without having a plan. You should always be looking for better career opportunities even if you are happy with your job. Save up enough money to support yourself for some time if you have not found a better job but you feel you must quit. The most common cause for depression is being unhappy with yourself. Whenever this is the issue, you must analyze yourself and find what exactly you don’t like about yourself. 
Your appearance: learn to accept your imperfections if you have no power over them. They are what make you unique but they do not define you. Look up a new haircut or hair color you find appealing and try it out. Buy self care products, such as lip scrubs, face mask/wash, moisturizers, make up and create a morning/night routine that makes you happy. If it is something you can change, such as your weight, see a nutritionist to find a diet that suits you. Begin exercising, even if it’s minimal like going for a 15 minute walk everyday but make it a custom. It takes time and dedication but you’ll start feeling better little by little. 
Your social skills: Everyone has trouble talking at first, no one is born with people skills. You must work and cultivate them like any other skill. Find someone you are comfortable with such as a family member and develop your skills with them. Work your way into striking up a conversation with a stranger but be ready for failure, as it is part of life. Nevertheless, every failure will only make you more experienced, hence better at this and any skill you develop. 
Lack of personality: Often when dealing with depression, you find yourself feeling like an empty shell of the person you used to be. It is important to remember that you have not lost your personality, it is just being overtaken by your depression. In this instance, it helps to surround yourself with people that care for you and do things you enjoyed before your depression. It will not bring your personality back instantly but it’ll get better day after day. Isolating yourself will only make it worse. 
Lack of interests: Depression makes every aspect of your life seem boring. Things you used to love will seem pointless. This is what causes most people to dig themselves a deeper hole in their depression pit. Time is of the essence here, you can’t rush out of this stage. You’ll need to be patient and continue going out and doing activities even if it seems mundane. Eventually you’ll regain that spark and love of life but it will take time. 

The key to getting better is to try new things, experiment and find what makes you happy. We are born as individuals so we feel we are alone often but that is not the case. There is always someone out there ready to lend a hand or an ear so ASK FOR HELP. I promise it will get better so don’t give up. Depression is a battle a lot of people have to deal at some point in their life. YOU ARE NOT ALONE. Take all the time you need to deal with it at your own pace, everyone’s got a different battle to fight so don’t let others compare and belittle you. The hardest part of recovering is letting go of what’s hurting you. Don’t put so much importance on what other people think of you, you must climb your mountain and reach the point where you’re happy with yourself. 

Make sure to see a therapist/psychiatrist if your depression persist. There is no magic pill to cure it instantly but it will help. Keep seeing them regularly to monitor your progress. Sometimes too heavy of a dose of medication can numb your brain and keep you from functioning properly so you must find a dose that fits you. DO NOT STOP TAKING YOUR MEDICATION WITHOUT YOUR PSYCHIATRIST’S RECOMMENDATION. Even if you feel better, your depression can come back and most times worse than before. 

Good luck everyone, hope this helps at least one person. ",0

It has caused me to lie in my bedroom by myself for hours everyday thinking and analyzing about what I am doing and what others are doing and why they do it. The more I think about it the more I can justify either side of a decision, and this is dangerous. When I feel like either side can be correct it feels like my choices don’t matter because everything is subjective and is based on perspective. It’s gotten to the point where I’m losing motivation to pursue anything or to build relations with anyone. The dream of investing into a bright future gets foggy and seems irrelevant. All the food is starting to taste the same and my days seem repetitive. I try to convince my self in lies in order to make things matter more and it works a little but when I realize what I’m really trying to do myself I just feel worse. It’s unpleasant that I have to set myself in a false reality to do anything and the more I’m aware I’m doing this, the more the effort itself become futile. Everything is starting to seem meaningless and it’s overwhelming me because this is scaring me.

267,"Ten years ago I was confident in knowing my purpose in life. I was confident that I came through the abuse, neglect, and abandonment I suffered as a child and adolescent without falling into the pitfalls of alcoholism, drug addiction, or violence so that I may serve a purpose. I was on the path to fulfill that purpose. There were signs I was on the right path. And though it was challenging I was adamant that would serve my purpose, and fulfill a destiny which made all that I was denied in life worth it.

My hope and ambition were taken from me. I've accepted a job in which very little is asked or expected of me.  I read nearly all day. The irony is that much of what I read is both a reminder of what inspired the goals on which I've given up, as well as that which lead to my downward spiral into despair. I want to die. I don't want to kill myself because that would hurt the one person I know loves me. So every day I go on living just to be alive, but I've been dead inside for years.

I'm nearing 29  years old in April and feel that i have not accomplished nothing throughout my life. I dont have a place of my own yet especially living in the Bay Area which does not help. I have not been in a relationship in over a decade which is due to me being pretty much timid and shy but that's how I grew up most of my life. I have no college education, so I've been working in a warehouse doing general labor work. How do find that spark to do more or to be more outgoing?  I want to be able to socialize more without being awkward. Does all this clasified as being depressed?

It’s really loud when I’m off my meds. The meds don’t help much, but they muffle the voice kinda. I feel like I’m gonna die but they probably wouldn’t care if I did anyways. I need people to know this. I don’t know why, but I feel like I need people to know. I’ve lost number of my attempts and they only change my meds and listen to me when I hospitalize myself. They only “care” about me when I’ve hopped over that edge. The system has failed me so many times. They say they make sure no one slipped through the cracks, but I’ve fallen down a deep ass sinkhole and they haven’t even batted an eye. I just keep having those urges to kill myself and they’re so strong that I’m practically twitching as a type this.

WHAT SHOULD I DO? Please help!!!

Sorry this is long:
I had a panic attack tonight, it was the second one I’ve ever had and it was scary. My friends and I were at a party which isn’t my thing because I always feel nervous or uncomfortable at them. I only go in order to spend time with my friends and in some ways I believe it’s one of the only ways to meet people here. I’m the only introvert in my friend group which gets rough sometimes because I feel like they don’t understand me. 
The panic attack was scary, I just  remember getting more and more tense and my breathing became more labored and I started to shake so i decided to leave the party.  I had a breakdown in my car, crying uncontrollably and all and I decided to stay in the parking lot because I didn’t want to leave my friends stranded since they didn’t have money and I was the only one with a car I waited two hours for them to come out because I didn’t want their fun to be ruined. When one of my three friends came back to the car, I told him what happened and he said I should’ve said something but he said “oh god” like he was annoyed with me like “oh here we go again”

That made me shut down further. Once my other friends came back I drove us Home and cried the whole way there. After dropping the first friend off, I told The other two what happened and I didn’t get one reaction whatsoever. They just kind of ignored it and continued a conversation which hurt and i started crying more. One of the friends consoled me a little after I kept trying to tell them how scary it was for me and that I was suffering, but it hurt that she didn’t do anything until I had to say “I know y’all probably don’t know how to respond but...” over and over. The other friend didn’t acknowledge it at all and kept going about her business.  This genuinely hurt my feelings and I never talk about my feelings so i just felt invalid when I finally opened up for once. I found some solace in my two friends in another state that I called but i needed someone who was physically there. It further solidified the fact that I’m kind of the odd one out in the group. I’ve been crying off and on, but what do you suggest I do? I feel so hurt and disappointed by them but am I overthinking this? ",0

287,"Hello, I’m an INFP male. It is a personality type for those of you unaware.

Being an INFP male makes me not fit in properly socially. This is because I feel as though I’m not man-enough in certain scenarios or situations where I need to be. However, at times, I can het get too masculine that I become cold.

An INFP is one who tends to be idealistic- ‘diplomats’ of our society if you will (though it never really feels that way). This is because we try to see the good in everyone and everything. INFPs are known to listen more than talk due to their ability to connect with other people’s emotions. A softy at heart basically.

Now, I am a 19-year old Lebanese dude whose been living in Canada for the past year by now (studying abroad with no family members in the country). You can imagine that these qualities don’t usually make me better fit to retain a female in relationship. They also make me look like somewhat of a ‘wuss’.

As INFPs, were also prone to depression and suicide and guess where I’m at now...

P.S. I do understand that the Myers-Briggs test isn’t that accurate, but I’ve repeated the test several times and gotten the same results multiple times enough to figure out my type of personality.

Time goes on and a couple of months into it she suggests that I should come visit.  I am seriously, seriously on cloud 9 about it. I get my tickets and we start making plans for the trip.

It's not, ""I'm going to be there for a week, we'll have plenty of time.""  It's ""Why do you bother putting yourself out there?  You know you don't deserve it. ""  
  
It's 50 pounds of over-reaction and depression in a ten pound bag.  And it's making me absolutely bonkers.  
  
To make matters worse, I wasn't able to completely hide that the change upset me...and I don't know how to explain to her that I understand, but my depression and self-loathing don't.  I don't know how to explain that, through an entirely reasonable set of circumstances, she stumbled head-first into one of the most heinous bits of my battle with depression... The belief that I really am a monster who doesn't deserve to be loved.  
  
How do I explain that it's not her, it's me... and how such a relatively small thing can so dramatically effect me?  
  
How do I convince someone I'm fairly rapidly falling in love with that I'm not that monster?  That maybe, in some way, I might even be someone worthy of her love.",0

296,"Our life is so indescribably meaningless in the grand scheme of all existence, that it actually makes me depressed. As humans, we feel like we’re the dominant species of the earth, we feel accomplished when we do big things. However, the depressing truth is, that we’re just sort of there. Our existence on this planet and our impact on everything is too insignificant to put in words. This earth is billions of years old, and we’re lucky enough if we live past 100 years. Even incredibly widely regarded people’s impact on society is meaningless relative to the whole history of existence. Everything we’ve done on earth is just going to be gone one day. Dying is so confusing for me as well. I was born into a religious family, but nowadays I question my beliefs. It seems more logical that nothing happens when we die, but at the same time it doesn’t. How do you feel nothing forever. When you sleep, you wake up eventually. When you die, you don’t. You have to feel something if you feel nothing, but you can’t if you don’t have a brain to feel anything. It just hurts my head thinking about it. I’m not depressed in general, it’s just that sometimes this comes to mind and it makes me feel really down. I don’t even know if anything I’m saying makes sense to anyone else, but if it does, it would really make my day if someone changed my perspective.",0

The thing is, I am absolutely terrible at taking exams (even if I know the material—I just get so anxious that my mind goes completely blank) and I was having a pretty bad depression day today to begin with. Should I just straight up tell my professor I’ve been suffering from depression this semester and have been in the process of changing medications? It’s been causing me to miss class  and not give a shit about grades. I don’t want it to sound like I’m using depression as an excuse—I know I’m at fault, but this semester has just been so rough on me. Has anyone else explained their situations to their professors?

My financial situation isn’t great family wise so there is the stress or necessity to keep it. I only have a few weeks left, hopefully everything gets better but that is what I’ve been telling myself for years. I’m still amazed I’m pulling off the kind of grades and exam scores I’m getting while my anxiety has been at its worst ever. Just trying my best to hold on. For like 30 more days.

I have an appointment with my therapist next week, but idk if I feel comfortable sharing with him my dark thoughts just yet

It’s tough. People ask me how my weekend was or how am i doing and I just lie and say “it was fine” or “doing great!” but I just feel more shitty lying. Time goes by too fast I feel like I haven’t done anything, and time will continue to go faster as I age while i do absolutely nothing but stay at home in my room.

The past three weeks have been rather bad, and I told my partner about how it was going a week ago. He’s become frustrated that I haven’t been responding to his advice very well. I can’t explain to him that I can’t just think happy thoughts and be positive. I’ve been trying my best to but I just can’t. There’s something stopping me. All I feel is guilt and pressure and I don’t know what to do anymore. The other day, he asked me why I just couldn’t be happy. I hate myself more for not being able to be happy. I felt so selfish.

That night, I couldn’t sleep. My head was filled with thoughts of suicide, and I made a plan on how to kill myself. I knew it was wrong, but it felt like the most sensible thing to do. I feel terrible and I can’t bear to see my partner worried off his mind.

I regret everything. I shouldn’t have told him anything. I should have told him that I was fine every time he asked me. It would’ve been a lot easier that way. We haven’t been talking much now, and I don’t know what to do anymore. ",0

2) Set goals

3) Exercise

I don’t doubt some people would have looked as I passed them, but nobody made me feel like shit, and when I was paying for the milk and a sneaky chocolate bar, the checkout woman stared at my extended arm for a moment and gave me a huge smile and said “Stay strong, you’ve got this”. 

I left the shop feeling a little less alone and invisible with some faith in strangers restored, and it honestly just felt nice. I have nobody else in my life I could share this to, so it felt okay to share it here.

i asked for help, able ran away from parents and marry to a foreigner. he is very kind, take me to doctors, don't complain about medical expenses and don't mind i have lot of sickness and mental problem. i was at my worst want to die a lot, lost a lot of interest in life. i can't work now, but i have been trying my best to study hard from zero everyday so i can earn some money in the future.

then now everyday i do activity (drawing practice mostly) with always in the mind  mom in law said ""having me is only bring deficit to this family and made her very tired"". so a lot of urge to suicide is strong. it's really distracting and i just want to give up.

my husband said to solve this dilemma is use MONEY POWER to shut off everyone. but i'm far from perfect. i'm still not good and far from ready to earn money. i tried to open commission 2 years ago, it didn't work well, bad draw, i'm very anxious and don't have confidence.

I’m getting into old destructive habits and I have an overwhelming feeling of loneliness. It doesn’t make sense, because I’ve got a family who loves me and a really dedicated and caring friend. 

At first, I thought I just needed more friends but I think I was just trying to fill that hole.

I spent a lot of afternoons and nights alone in bed wishing for somebody to call me or ask to hang out. Last week my best friend picked me up and we hung out for a long time but I still felt that pit in my chest.

That’s the thing I hate about this. When I’ve got everything, food, friends, family, a roof over my head, I still feel that wanting. And I don’t know what I want. 

It makes me feel worse and guilty for not appreciating everything that I have. I just want to break this cycle and get back to my normal self.

I’m really getting tired of putting on a face to get through the day, just barely convincing myself that I’m good enough for the world.

I lived in a monochromatic desert devoid of any features. Just desolate colorless, wasteland. Real life could be outside on a sunny day with people around me but I felt completely alone in a flat world of gray a deathly dry wind.

338,"Every time I miss my brother I end up re-playing this game. It seems so long ago, but the emotions I feel while I play are still the same. I make the same choices me and my brother made 15 years ago. I still give the same stupid nicknames to the aeons. I still don’t know how to play blitz ball. And I still remember where all of the Albhed dictionaries are.

My brother and I ended up dumping like 500hrs into that game, back on the ps2. We got almost everything. And thinking of it, it was some of the most fun I’ve ever had in life. Now that I live 6000+ miles away from him, I can just play and remember. I knew I wouldn’t have seen him again the moment I left. But hey, I can just treasure those days, and text him the game screenshots to start a conversation.

I’ve played 8hrs today. But it doesn’t feel like I’ve wasted my time. Because it still feel exactly the same. Even though when I comment, he’s not there to answer or laugh with me.

339,"I'm a (31f) and this last year I finally had enough of feeling the most terrible I ever have in my life so far. I've struggled since I was a child, and never really committed to a medication or therapy of any kind for all kinds of reasons.

Almost two years ago my husband needed to see a doctor for his shoulder and had to be seen by a doctor he's never seen, but we loved him so much that months later I chose him to become my new general practitioner.  He's helped me get my life on tack. I make every appointment, and I do not miss for any reason.

Finally able to smile again. I've had the strength to cut unnecessary people out of my life, and after almost 15 years I'm journaling again to keep my mind in check. I know medication doesn't solve everything, but finding the right doctor really helped jump start a way back to myself. I'm a better wife and mother. I'm learning to let the petty shit go and move forward no matter the situation. I've always been estranged from my siblings, but am finally able to put forth the effort to forge relationships with them.

I still have hard days. And thoes days can sometimes string together and seem insurmountable. But they pass. It's ok to mope a little, but I've learned how to reach out and ask for help. Journal some thoughts down, play a game, read a bit, and good night's sleep can do wonders.

I hope my short story can give someone hope. I was a terrible alcoholic who smoked a pack a day, and am almost a year sober and smoke free. My husband was worried I was going to kill myself with how badly I drank. It is possible to find help, good days are so very possible. Feeling better is so very possible.

340,"Casting the circle

We want to set off under an auspicious sign.  We would most love to begin with the best of conditions.  We really would.  In the past, nothing seemed quite right for this; it was never quite “the right time.”  We are somewhat sensitive, and admittedly, rather fussy.  But as I have said, in this world, this body, this mind, there is little magic left.  There is a slight pulse, however, and there is a halo of events, from which we may pluck here and there to construct some semblance of a narrative.  But we do believe that the conditions we work under are anything but conducive to the endeavor.  And time is not our friend, either.

Walk away

The air seemed so alive, back then.  There was a charge that you could feel as you breathed in the October chill, something beyond paired oxygen atoms vibrating inside of your lungs.  Everything was completely different in those days; now everything is dry and lifeless, it seems.   Smothered.  Or maybe it’s just me; maybe it’s just that I’ve become numb to it all.

Reunions

There is something so delicious about not participating in things.  Something about being invisible, forgotten, rare.  Erasure, but still I’ve always been there, languished, but living no less.  You could almost call it a fetish of mine; it does give me a thrill.  Knowing that the glasses are clinking, the people are chattering, laughing, joyous, all without me.  Some would find it pitiable, being left out like that, but then again most people aren't insane.  Personally, I get a shudder when I think that yes, yes, it’s possible they may not even mention my name.  They may not even think of me, either.  An odd, quiet moment away from the fray – but no, still nothing.  I’m not even there in spirit.
Explanations for all this are quite beyond me.  All I can tell you is that obscurity is love.
And maybe it’s that I’m too dead for you, or maybe it’s that I’m too alive.  All I know is that I don’t want to be here anymore.

Objects

I sometimes think about… what if.  What if things had gone this way, what if I had traveled elsewhere, held on longer?  What am I missing now?  What if I didn’t crash and burn?  What if the accident never happened, and I never got sick?
I remembered that when I was a child, there was a pair of bicycles in the garage.  My mother had bought them for us to ride together, but I was afraid of falling, and so for a long time, they remained unused.  And I remember one night that I cried myself to sleep thinking about them, thinking about the loneliness they must have felt in the dark, dusty cold.  But I still never wanted to learn.

Veins

Often I wonder about all the little things I must have missed.  It drove me crazy sometimes; the world was so massive and unforgiving, unapologetic in its fullness.  There were so many things to look at, so many tender, growing, beating things.  Everything, every single thing, has a heart that beats its own peculiar song, and you wanted to cradle each one, nurture and tend to each, to learn all their songs.  You must have missed so much, but you didn’t mind back then.  You were living; you were one of those growing, crawling, throbbing things.  You had your own song, and there were those who had heard it, and those who still remember it by heart.
Within each atom there is an entire throbbing universe, if we could only peer deeply enough.  The awful truth, however, is that infinity is not enough.

The golden age

It seemed there was a time when everything around was animated by this autumnal bliss.  The world must have held you tighter back then… back then. 
What’s the difference between then and now?  The air hasn’t changed at all; no, it is me.
Back then… There is always a glorious past that we are relating our present moment to.  And necessarily, the present must be an unfulfilled and delirious moment, warped by frustrations and anxieties, with a tenebrous future awaiting us beyond its veil.
When, why, how did I manage to get this way?  What drove me so crazy?",0

&amp;#x200B;

Backstory this is a story from one of my darkest times of my life. I wanted to die

&amp;#x200B;

After sevral years in a violent relationship were physical and mental torture took place,i managed get out with my toddler.

&amp;#x200B;

I knew i needed help since i was in no shape to care for a small kid in my mental state. Thereby i set myself on a wait list to get into a psyciatric ward.

&amp;#x200B;

Time passed and i got gradually worse but had reguallary check ups with my doc.

&amp;#x200B;

One day i came in and i had taken time to put on make up do my hair and i was in a wery happy mood. People around me comented on how it seemed like things went so much better for me now and i looked so much healtier. I smiled at em and agreed evrything was fine cause at the moment i felt evrything was fine and things was going like it shoud do.

&amp;#x200B;

My doc also comented how good i looked and she was happy to see i did ok.

&amp;#x200B;

I said yes evrything was ok and i felt happy for first time in a long while. she talked a bit and asked what i was going to do during the week and so on normal chit chat. I happily told her i was going icefishing because i got a lifeinsurance now and i had evrything set up and i smiled to her. 

(i was so happy since evrything was ready and i knew what to do. And i honestly thought my toddler was better off with the lifeinsurance then having me.)

&amp;#x200B;

Her face dropped and The wait list to get into mental care suddenly was non existing. Bang i was locked up.

&amp;#x200B;

Here comes my story

&amp;#x200B;

I was scared of people and did not mingle with anyone. i just sat in my bed hiding from the world or out to smoking area to have a cig. That was my days.

Then my birthday came around i was a bit more cheered up with the diea of getting my son for visit and my family coming around.

&amp;#x200B;

Before bedtime i had a couple deliverys. Some flowers from my parents and from my siblings. a smalll card saying they didnt want to bring my son into were it was alot of insane people so they woud not come for my birthday. My sister atleast called to wish me happy birthday before she said they woudnt come either.

&amp;#x200B;

I sat there all alone knowing noone woud bother to come. The flowers went into the trash.

&amp;#x200B;

i spendt the night walking the corridors. smoking and hiding in a corner with my hair as a drape in front of my face so people woudnt see me cry.

&amp;#x200B;

Then this other girl lets call her Annie ,same age as me early 20s sat down next to me. Her hands was red and swollen since she needed wash evrytime she touched something and scrubbed her skin off.

&amp;#x200B;

There i sit a complete mess filthy and smelling since i had stopped washing/combing to make people awoid me and leave me in peace since i was scared of them.I wasnt even human it felt. She stoke my back and asked in the mildest voice ever what was wrong since i was silently crying and hiding.

&amp;#x200B;

 The fact that Annie herself was germophobic and sat there stroking me in my state was just unreal.Her compation with a fellow human overcame her fear of germs. Something that realy shows what kind of warmhearted person she was. The compation broke me and i bursted out with how my family woudnt even come and evryone had called the day before my birthday and how i missed my son and noone cared.

&amp;#x200B;

Annie herself was a patient but managed cam me down and even talk. calmer i went to my room after she returned to hers. and i sat there sulking feeling sorry for myself. I needed something to do so i went to kicthen asking if i coud help make food (since it was diffrent task we was allowed to help with to break the monotomi) i was brushed off with no the group was full and they coudnt fit me in since there was enough. I then asked if i coud go walk with the outgoing group but also got told no they was full. There was rules on how many patients on each group due to number of carers.

&amp;#x200B;

Dinner came along and i had gone hiding in my room crying for myself and sulking. i didnt want to go for dinner and refused to move. My carer then came in and ordered me to come or he woud carry me. He looked at me and told me

&amp;#x200B;

I can promise you that people will look at you more if i carry you then if you walk by yourself.

&amp;#x200B;

i dragged myself out of bed and we walked into the dining hall. When we opened the door all the patients and staff stood there cheering and started sing happy birthday. Annie had told the staff what had happend. so Annie had gone with the group that was in kitchen and made a birthday cake for me,the outgoing group had bought a present that they all had chipped in for. I stood there frozen before i started cry. That was the most memorable birthday ever. And it shows that people who is down on their luck actually are warmer and more caring then many others.

&amp;#x200B;

Annie and i got out of there and  became good friends. She was  like a godsent Angel for me. In a weird way we connected and actually helped eachother to heal more then the place we was did.

&amp;#x200B;

It took time but in the end we bouth managed get over our fears And are now funcionable people. It shows that no matter how dark it is there is always a ray of light if you look for it. Annie was my light and probably the best person i coud met.

354,"So little bit of background, I just turned 17 and this girl is almost 16 we had known each other for about a year and a half before this. I have struggled with MDD for about 4 or 5 years now. 

Anyway, this girl and I used to have lunch together everyday for a year and a half before our schedules got changed and we had different lunch hours so we saw each other less. After that, she realized I was in an art class while she was in her lunch hour so everyday she came to see me. She was going through a semi abusive-is break up and had slipped into a depressive state for a couple months because her previous boyfriend blamed her for making him feel so alone. Naturally, I comforted her through it and we talked about how she was feeling everyday. 

We got really close. Soon, a school dance came up and we decided to go together. It was an amazing Friday night. We did things teenagers did together at dances. After the night was over, we both went home and I didn't hear from her all weekend. I'll admit at this point because of how close we were, I started developing feelings for her... And it seemed like she did for me as well based on the night of the dance.

Monday came around and when I got to our every morning hang out spot at my school, she was with another guy... They seemed almost as close as me as her did but instead of getting a hug from her like I did everyday, she seemed to interested in him to even notice me.

She still came everyday at lunch to my art class but she brought that guy with her every time. But something was different... She no longer talked to me. It was like all of our interactions ended faster than I could snap my fingers. This continued for a long time before finally she stopped coming. (it is important to know that this guy was not her boyfriend)

I made it my goal to find one of her classes and try to talk to her when passing period came. When she came out, she looked at me and asked me ""since when do you walk this way?"" then saw that the same guy was walking the other direction down the hall and immediately left me before I could say anything.

After this happened, it all just went to sh*t. I started having freaking reaccuring dreams replaying that memory over and over again. (I still do)
Words cannot describe how much I was hurting. I felt abandoned and alone... Not to mention that her friends that I was also ""friends"" with stopped talking to me as well.

At this point I was clean from Self Harm for 3 months but I got to such a low point that I started again... It wasn't as many times but I was definitely deeper.

Now in the present, she still doesn't talk to me and hasn't for a while. I just don't know how to move on though. It's like every time I have a dream it involves her in some way... Or me badly harming myself. ",0
355,"Second post on here.

I’m not sure what I’m experiencing could be called depression. It’s more like utter emptiness. 

Stuff feels meaningless. Just activities I do out of habit or to get some kind of temporary pleasure. I’m walking through life like a robot. There’s no long term purpose in what I do. 

I don’t know what’s going to happen to me. I’m not even suicidal. I’m just empty. No motivation. 

Have I gotten too far into my own mind? I’m a pretty smart person. 

Is this some sort of liberation which I don’t know how to handle? Sometimes I feel the curtains have been pulled back and I can see life as it really is, i.e., a biological game spiced with humanity’s crazy mental constructs. 

I don’t know. Any feedback? 

P.S. I’m not taking any kind of medication or drug and I haven’t been diagnosed with any mental disorders. ",0
356,"Has anyone else been finding that over time that they're less sad and more so angry? Don't get me wrong, I definitely still feel empty and sad, but it feels like where I once felt sad about a lot of things I now feel resentment and anger. It doesn't matter if I'm thinking about the world, the people who I feel have ""wronged me"" or even myself - my initial response is always fury. I'm not sure if this is just part of the path to recovery or if it's a result of pent up frustration with no way to express it, but it doesn't feel healthy. In some ways, it feels liberating to not be crippled by everlasting sadness but I'm not really sure how much better this is. I haven't consciously acted upon my angry thoughts, but I feel extremely petty for simply having them and holding grudges. I've tried my best to prevent it from affecting my day to day life but sometimes when I listen to what I say or read my messages it feels really off-key and strange. Despite feeling ""wronged"" or my brain deciding to cast blame upon others, I really don't want to become toxic or verbally lash out at someone. How do you guys release this type of anger?

I can’t talk to anyone about this, because all anyone will ever tell me is that I’m being “lazy” or that this is just part of “adult life”. Well if this is what being an adult is like, I want absolutely nothing to do with it. The most infuriating part is that there is no escape. Within 1 year, I’ve gone from being a careless teenager, to an adult with a car payment, rent, pg&amp;e, and whatever else the fuck I have to pay for to “survive”.... none of that seems worth it at all if this is how I have to feel to achieve it. The saddest part is I have the easiest job in the world. Great environment, great co-workers, great managers, I get to sit in my car for 80% of the day, and I make good money for what I do. But none of that matters when I don’t WANT to be doing it. It sucks because I’m self aware of the fact that it’s just my toxic mentality that’s causing this.. but I can’t break out of it. I’ve had 4 different jobs in the past year and every single one has made me feel this way. So I know it’s not the job I do. I just hate having to work. I just hate the idea of committing myself to the monotony of doing the same thing everyday just to make another person more rich. I can’t take it anymore... the more I do this the more I fantasize about death.. it’s honestly the only thing that gets me through my days now.. is telling myself that it’ll all end soon. It feels like there’s no solution here. Either I quit, and lose everything I’ve worked towards, and be forced to move back in with one of my parents (who both have no grasp on mental health, and have stated they would not at all be supportive if that happened). Or I keep slaving away and lose grip over my mind slowly and slowly until I fall off of the deep end. I just don’t know what to do. I feel so guilty that I feel this way too, because I was raised under the ideology that people that don’t want to work are “bad people” and only want to use the system to benefit themselves. I don’t feel that’s what I am.. but to my parents that’s what I am. So I just have to put on a fake face and tell them that “yup everything is going good, just working and gettin though life.” And the moment I start talking about work, it’s like I’m suddenly on the same level with them again, and they have respect for me. Why is it that when you’re employed you automatically gain respect? I think that’s such a terrible mentality..

Sorry I feel like I kinda went off topic with my rant.

Anyways I just needed to type out my feelings to get my mind off the fact that I’m about to go want to die for the next 8 hours.. and then do the same thing again, and again, and again.

Not really sure if I’m looking for “advice” as I don’t think there’s really an answer here. I’m either going to quit and ruin the life I’ve started building for myself, or eventually kill myself from the amount of agony, sadness, anger, and all negative emotions that having to work is causing me.

I have “dreams” and things I want to accomplish, but we as a society aren’t aloud to focus on such “silly” things. Because if I work, all motivation I have to do the things I want to do dissipates immediately. I used to use my time so good, and try to achieve as much as I can throughout my days. Now anytime I’m not working, I either want to sleep, or do nothing at all. Nothing brings me joy, knowing that I have to do this bullshit everyday. I wish I could feel joy again. The closet thing I get to joy is the comfort of sleep. At least I don’t have to think about work while I’m asleep.

Anyways, time to go fantasize about death for the next 8 hours.

362,The only friend that I have at work left already and I feel so alone. I'm so out of place and I feel so alone. I'm so scared. I want to cry right now I don't know what to do. I hate myself for being like this. I hate myself so much. ,0
363,"I've gone through a rough past few months, with losing two friends who did me dirty (like dirty dirty, one fucked the other when we didn't know each other but never told me while the other was trying to get at me 24/7 and knew i had feelings for them) this really messed me up mentally for a month or two, and I still can't believe that happened but I'm ok now. This happened at the end of the last semester, and I pretty much came into this semester with no friends, just my sister (thank god) since she really was a rock for me during this time. I had some ""friends"" or more so acquitances that were involved in a club on campus, and these two girls were really nice and I wanted to be friends with them, and decided to try to join their club. I thankfully went through an interview and go accepted in! That was seriously the best decision I made this year since it has made me meet some really good and nice people who share similar interests with me. I feel like I belong to something now, which is something I've never really felt. I was hesitant to join the club since I was just so down and already dealing with my depression and all this personal life stuff just got in the way. But my sister really pushed me to join the club and to try and see if I like it. And I'm so happy I did. I really hope I can make some good friends and be more active on campus and less isolated, alone and depressed. I know many of us on here are depressed and can't really see the light at the end of the tunnel. But If I have any advice it would be to try to step out of your comfort zone. And understand that your depression is sort of this damaging self-destructive cycle, but we have to be the ones to break this cycle. Maybe join a club on campus that is related to your major or something your interested in, or join something where you can be more social and be around others. I just hope that I can continue to better my life and not let any issues or people bring me down. Cause I know I really could have closed off this semester from what I experienced before, but I really just want to be happy and healthy. Thanks for listening :)",0

366,"First time poster here, I've been reading for a while though. I've recently been diagnosed with severe social anxiety disorder and no medication has taken me out of my downwards spiral of anxiety and depression. It's been maybe four years, I only managed to reach out a year or two again and I feel like I haven't moved at all. I used to be a straight A student, but now I'm lucky if I get a D in any class. Life just seems pointless I guess.

&amp;#x200B;

I guess the thing that's been on my mind most often is the impact I'm going to leave on the world... It's been 18 years and I have impacted no one or nothing; and I don't see myself impacting anything in the future either. Life just feels like a pointless slog towards death, and I can't move that along quicker without impacting people. It feels like a limbo, I've accepted my pointlessness and that I mean nothing, and at this point I just want to be forgotten. It's weird because I always have this nagging in my head that I am taking up too much space and impacting everyone negatively, probably the S.A.D. whoops, and I don't want to be that way. Interacting makes me want to die, and doing nothing also makes me want to die badly. I guess I don't know what to do, at this point I want to just stop trying with medication and therapy and just accept my fate (although accepting that will probably only make all of this worse). I feel like a fool really. The world will always continue to be the shitty place I was born into, and I can make it better for no one being I am just a weight holding everyone's heads underwater. I just want to cut the chains and drift off until no one recalls me. 

&amp;#x200B;

I have a problem with depression and anxiety but mainly addiction. I am heavy addicted to Xanax (I've been cutting down), but every now and then then you'll see me fucked up on alcohol or xans. Okay? I know my fault.

Now I woke up an hour ago at 1am after drinking more than a half bottle of vodka and some sleeping pills and seeing a fucking letter that my aunt said to go back to my mother. Fuck. You.

Alright. I get fucked up often but HAVE THEY EVER TRIED TO GET TO KNOW WHAT THE FUCK I FEEL AND WHAT GOES ON IN MY BRAIN OR WHAT MAKES ME GET FUCKED UP? NO AND GUESS WHAT. IT'S THEM AND THE SITUATIONS WITH THEM. 

I know they tried to help. I know they brought me to psychiatrists, psychologists and all that bullshit but it doesn't help at all. I just do it for the scripts. 

Now my mother and father want to move to another place where I won't go no matter what.

My aunt and her family is also religious af and they say they got fucking ""rules"". Aunt also got depression but she can't understand how addiction works. She just can't. It's simple.

So now I'm stuck. I'm 16yo. In between 2 houses that I feel trapped, unable to do anything, and my only thought is about ending it all as soon as possible.

377,"I had been having on and off episodes where I just suddenly lose interest to do things. One morning I have all planned out, coffee in the machine, workout and office clothes laid out, to-do lists all set and plans for the day made - all done the night before. I woke up the next day and I just am tired. I don't feel like doing anything, leave things half-way done and find it extremely difficult to get basic things done. I have been lately thinking (almost all the time) about my life, achievements and feel like I have failed. I am not able to find anything worth looking forward to. I masturbate regularly, often mindlessly. I just do it without thinking much. In the office, I just want to go home and sleep (lie in bed) and want the day to be over.

I am 35m, dad of a 4 yr old and has a good job which pays well. There are some quirks associated with the job but overall it comes without many hassles. I am not able to learn anything new. I haven't taken any initiatives for a long time. I am technically strong (or used to be) but haven't done anything noteworthy in the last 1.5 years (before that I used to be the rock-star in my team). I have plenty of ideas, but I am not able to move. Recently there have been complaints about my performance. This helplessness kind of dulls me further and this forms some sort of a vicious cycle. These days I am scared when a simple request shows up at my desk to be worked on.

Almost the same on the social front as well. Absolutely no friends, no one to talk to. My daughter and wife are in my home country and they are among the larger familial circles and are cared for. What stumps me is that I am not able to get excited about my daughter's achievements (she sang this new song, she made this drawing, etc). I don't feel like going back to my family (and country) because I am afraid they would ask me how much money I have made, or what plans I have for future, etc (i don't have answers to these). I wish I could go back to my mom, hug her tight and never leave her. (My eyes are fucking watery and I am in office now).Dad turned out to be some sort of a monster (tried to have sex with my wife) and we no longer talk to him. Mom decided to be with him, refused to accept his faults. Bit of soup there as well.

I workout, lost a lot of weight but it just keeps coming back. I have massive cravings like all I want to eat is just cake. Different kinds of cakes. For lunch, dinner, and breakfast. Working out excites me usually, I plan and prepare in advance for that. I spent a lot of money on athletic clothes, all kinds of supplements and powders. Some days, all that excitement just dies down. I find me in my bed, staring at the ceiling when my alarm goes off in the morning. Once I hit the gym, I can continue for the next few days constantly. I eat clean and well during that time as well.

I had me tested for depression about four months back and the doc said everything's all right, it was just a lack of sleep. I tried sleeping well but I am not sure if that has made any difference. I smoke weed almost every day. Have been on that for a year now. I had not mentioned this to the doc.

My major issues are indecisiveness, memory loss (forgot my wife's bday even though I know her DOB very well) which affects people around me. Also, extreme laziness or not able to get anything done. Am I crazy? Am I depressed? Seeking medical help is out of the question for me unless I am pretty sure about it.

PS: I started writing this post during noontime, I was on the verge of emotional breakdown. At some point, I thought office folks would see me crying out loud. Now its end of the day here, I am a normal guy. Completed some work, ate some food and talked to a couple of folks.

382,"So I'm coming here for a bit of advice and to hopefully get some questions answered. I apologise for this being so long. 

My girlfriend of 9 months broke up with me last week. All her life she's struggled with depression but in the time I knew her, she was quite good at managing it. For the first 8 months it was great, she always told me that she loved me and she wanted to do stuff with me, she'd get excited to see me and she always talk about wanting to spend her life with me and have kids with me. 

The beginning of march is where it changed, she told me that she'd been struggling with her depression for a couple of days and that she was being sad all the time because of it,  Over the few weeks she became more and more distant and didn't talk to me as much. She just didn't seem herself anymore. 

She broke up with me last week. She said that she can't focus on the relationship right now and she feels like she's responsible for my happiness and she can't deal with that pressure right now. Another thing she said is that she doesn't feel like she's good enough and she thinks i deserve better than her. Which is not true at all. She kept saying that she still loves me and thinks the world of me and that she still wants me around and she hopes we can remain ""at least friends"". A couple of days after we spoke little and I asked if she still loves me and she said yes, then I asked if she sees a future for us and she said she doesn't think so.

So the reason I'm posting this here is to hopefully get some questions answered and hopefully get a better idea of how she's feeling right now, since I've never suffered with depression myself so I don't completely understand how she is right now.

- Is there anything I can do to help her?
- how can I better understand what she's going through
- could I be right about her trying to push me away because she thinks it's what's best for me
- is there any chance we could get back together after this

I'm just so confused about the whole situation right now, all I know is that I love her so fucking much and I don't wanna be with anyone else, and that she's in a pretty bad place right now.

396,"It's a weird funk isn't? You beat yourself and crave intimate connection with people, doesn't even have to be romantically either. Just a real genuine connection with someone that you could just relax around. You know have deadlines coming up and you stress about it yet your body does nothing when your brain is screaming that you'll regret it or maybe losing points is what you deserve anyway. And the scariest part is knowing that you just don't give a shit anymore if you're really honest with yourself and it sucks because you want to but it's just not there. No spark, no flame, no drive.

You look around at people and really try to understand how they do it. How they can become so close to people cuz clearly you forgot. You wonder how they have so much drive and you end up getting frustratingly jealous but it's more of a  sorrowful feeling if anything. 

I'll have days when I'm more optimistic, maybe my playlist is playing all the right songs and maybe there wasn't as much small talk. But then there are days when you just can't help but over think about how maybe the best relationships you'll have have already been made and your self destructive behavior is getting harder to control. From when you wake up that day till the end of the week sometimes. 

I don't want to call it depression cuz I feel privileged. I've made amazing friends, I'm just not now and feel more lonely than ever. I feel easy to forget and those relationships are probably going to fade away with time eventually.  My procrastination isn't a real problem, I'm just lazy.

These little things are just things I have to work on. Easy fix. I don't need professional help or counseling cuz then I'd be taking away time from someone who needs it more than me.

It's aight, I don't really care, but she did it after he treated her like an incel - long story short, he annoyed her by trying to sleep with her, she didn't want, he stopped talking to her, and ""to make things right"" she just slept with him and they sorted it out and fine now.

I asked her ""so you just did it when he was incely towords you?""
""Yeah who cares""
""Alright if you say so..."".

Point is: It's fine.
I don't care, she always shares this and we share almost everything.

But for my point: why am I always getting similar things like an insult to me?
Like a statement to ""you're toleratable, but I, or anybody else, will never see anything more in you, you're just there"".

Why am I thinking like this?
What's wrong with me?

I have been dealing with depression for a year now and most days I just lay in the floor and cry. It started effecting my sleeping schedule. I either sleep 3hrs, 10hrs or none at all. I have told my closest friends about my dysfunctional self but while 3 of them care and try to help and support me, the other 3 do not get it. The other day one of them cam up to me and said, ""what's going on? You look depressed or something"". Why can't they get it? After that I spent an hour or so crying but yeah.
This post may look dumb but I needed to vent so I'm sorry. Also, I need a hug ",0
399,"Everyone who I've talked to about my depression says it gets better, but when? It's been 3 years since I tried to off myself and I don't even know how long I was depressed for before that. I just want it to end. I don't feel like I'm progressing, everyone's talking about uni applications but I don't know if Im even gonna be alive then.",0
400,"I got know where else to go to vent about this. I’ve already bothered my close friends about this too much and I’ve told my parents about it but they have enough to worry about and I just end up feeling like I’m burdening them. 

I’ve been dealing with depression since I was about 14 I’m almost 20 now. Nothing ever triggered it for me it just kind of crept up on me. Random feelings of complete sadness and thinking no one actually liked me. I grew up in a big family with older siblings so naturally they use to pick on me all the time. I thought they were just toughening me up but I don’t know if that had anything to do with my problems today.

Couple years later Im 16 and I get a girlfriend towards the start of my junior year in high school things were great for a few months but I always had that doubt in the back of my mind like I always do. I might sound like an asshole here but I eventually just got bored of her it just didn’t really seem like a deep meaningful relationship and it just got so repetitive doing the same things all the time never having any deep meaningful conversations or anything. Could have 
just been my fault but I don’t know. that lasted for about a year until I told her I wanted a break and we ended up breaking up shortly after that. 

After we broke up I was even more depressed and things started looking really dark for me. Ended up finishing high school a year early and was just working. I met this girl on this dating app and we were talking for awhile and decided to meet up. Everything seemed great and everything went really well she said how much she liked me and cared about me and all that shit. Couple days later it’s Valentine’s Day. I’m stuck at work and I get a text from her mother telling me her daughter wasn’t allowed to date anyone and she thought I went out with her on Valentine’s Day but I didn’t go anywhere with her. Turns out she was talking to this other guy . I tried talking to her about it afterwards but she never talked to me after that and ended up blocking me for no reason. I felt worthless wondering what I did wrong or what I could’ve done differently. 

After that I’ve stayed completely single going on a couple dates here and there but they never really went anywhere. I decided that if I really wanted to have a meaningful relationship I had a lot of things I needed to work on myself. 

My first semester of college I was getting pretty behind in everything and I procrastinated everything I could and started getting behind in all my classes and In the middle of the semester one of my best friends got into a car accident and was killed. Completely failed that semester and ended up falling into the worst depression in my life. I just became numb to everything started drinking a lot and smoking way too much weed everything just seemed so dark and pointless. Life seemed like a big joke to me and honestly it still does. I thought moving out of my parents house and getting my own apartment would make me happy but it didn’t. I just ended up smoking more weed every day and just kept to myself most of the time lying in bed all day mindlessly scrolling through the internet. 

That’s where I am today I’m still at the same apartment and no matter how much I try to get myself out of this depression nothing seems to work. I’ve tried a bunch of different supplements supposed to help with depression but nothing seems to work. I’ve tried adjusting my diet and exercise more but I just end up getting even more pissed off. I tried going back to college but the same thing happened as last semester I started off strong but in the end I just ended up not doing enough of my homework and skipping class too much and ended up failing again. I’m just so fucking sick of everything. None of my hobbies seem to interest me anymore and I feel like I’m living the same hell day over and over again and I just can’t fucking take it anymore. I’m not suicidal at all because I just couldn’t bring myself to do that to my family but I’d be lying if I said I didn’t think about it all the time. It just gets really hard especially at night being left alone with my thoughts I have insomnia and it doesn’t matter if I get up early and I’m active all day I’ll still lie there in bed trying to fall asleep until the sun comes up. I’m just so sick of living this meaningless life. If I can’t be happy now why would it matter how successful I am I still don’t think it could make a difference. And it’s not like I don’t have friends I hangout with them every week but it just feels like a distraction from depression. It’s easy to put on a big smile in front of everyone else smiling cause if you don’t people will constantly ask what’s wrong but it’s just too hard to explain it to people. I’m just rambling at this point but I just can’t find a good reason to go on other than for my family. I owe them that. But I can’t find a reason for myself. I have no motivation and everything just seems pointless to me. I just want to feel that same joy I did as a kid when I didn’t have this dark cloud following me wherever I went

401,"For the better part of 5 years now, I have constantly been dealing with what I would call a mild form of depression. I say this because I have never been tested for it, and consequently I don't take anything for it. It pretty much boils down to some days I feel ok, some days I feel down. It's gotten to the point that out of the week, I feel down at least 5 days out of the 7, the other 2 just being ""all right"". Some days I wake up feeling fine, only to think about something or get told something, and then it goes down from there, or I wake up already feeling down and this carries on for the rest of the day. I think that this mainly has to do with the fact that I don't find a point in my own personal life. I don't have any passions that scream out at me, anything I can really be useful or good at, so, I don't find a point in my life. I have already graduated from university and this has only gone and worsened my bouts of ""mild depression"". At least while I was a student I could have that to distract me, but searching for a job while others are constantly telling me to get a job and bringing it up any time they see me not applying for something, it makes me feel like I can't do anything anymore without having my sense of self questioned. I'm just really in a difficult time in my life, when it comes to self appreciation and pushing myself to do things, seeing as how anything I try in order to find what I am passionate or good at turns out to not be successful.

411,"Basically the title.  

My depression was diagnosed in 2015, but I'm pretty sure I've had it since at least 2013 or 2014, and I've pretty much always been able to carry out basic daily functions, with a few exceptions here and there.  It got so great to the point where I even stopped taking my antidepressant in 2017 (very bad move), though I'm back on it now (and doing a lot better), but I honestly don't think people would be able to quickly figure out I'm depressed unless I tell them.

I have several friends who aren't as fortunate as I am, and their depression is so bad that it causes them to skip school/work, not do homework, even drop college classes. For example, I'm one of the leaders of a student organization that these particular friends are part of, and we have mandatory attendance at certain events; these people have skipped out on mandatory events with depression as an excuse.  Honest to God, I wish I could do that, but I know I have a commitment to this organization and show up anyway.  As someone who has high-functioning depression, this is something I understand but can't quite wrap my head around, since I'm lucky enough to at least have enough motivation to be able to drag myself out of bed in the morning.  For lack of better words, I guess I've gotten pretty good at being able to shove depression to the back of my mind for a couple of hours depending on the situation.

I want to support my friends and help them deal with their depression, especially since I'm in the same boat, but I don't know how to do it without coming off as holier-than-thou.  How do I support my severely depressed friends while still encouraging them to complete activities and fulfill duties?

I think my breathing got heavier the more I held it, because by the time I sat back on my bed, I was breathing VERY heavily and very shortly as well, and began to shake and cry. I was aware of it as it was happening and I wanted to stop, but I felt like I couldn't control it. I also felt very tingly/trembly, like I was going to pass out or something.

I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder and paranoia, my doctor gave me lithium (300 mg) about 5 days ago and now I feel bad.

420,"So, I was wondering what is your opinion when it comes to living healthily during a mental illness.

I've been struggling with depression from October to January, now it's gotten better. I still have depressive mood on occasion, and am still struggling with the anxiety. Anxiety in my case has this feature, that I often get this shortage of breath, when I think about things I'm anxious about. This shortages can make me really unmotivated to do anything, it's like I'm losing the will to live. After something like this happens, length of my lack of motivation can vary from 15 minutes to a whole week.

Now the problem is, I eat and live like shit. I'm currently studying, so I buy myself the cheapest food for the most of the time. Frozen pizzas, toasts, hot dogs and shit like this. I rarely visit the gym too (even though it's in my dorm for free). The thing is, taking into account of what I plan to do in the future (I'd like to become a commercial pilot), I should change this. I WANT to change this. The problem is that when I start changing my habits, I tend to stop because a day happens, when I feel like shit due to my mental state. After a day like this, all progress is lost.

Do you think it's possible to maintain a healthy lifestyle during a mental illness? Or do you think that it's a lost cause, and I should focus on my mental health first? Did you struggle with this too?",0
421,"I feel totally lost.  I am a 41 year old male struggling with life.  I grew up in a sheltered Air Force family where I was more shy than sheltered so I did not really do any coming out of my shell until after high school.  My parents literally wanted me to go party and experience life.  And I did!  Had a scholarship to a local community college which I screwed off because of partying.  My parents basically threw money at me so I never learned the value of money.  You know you hear about people who grew up poor and turned out to be millionaires? I am the opposite.  Struggling from paycheck to paycheck.  

I started working at a young age at a dialup internet service provider (before the internet) and did very well doing technical support and also selling T1 (ISDN, T’s) lines.  Company got bought out by another huge ISP and your favorite cell phone company.  Since then I have been doing various jobs in the company, mostly phone based.  I am an introvert (ISTP-T) and have a hard time making small talk which we are forced to do.  Making human connection.  Well you know cell phones have large issues with idiots and outsourced overseas agents working for them messing things up.  So the bright folks like myself have to clean up the work.  And get bitched out by angry customers in the process, which I take personally.  Pays well and I have been here for so long that I only have 8 years til I can retire.  Going for my bachelors in business management/mis, which I only have about 12 to 15 hours left. 

I have always been a very intelligent person who can do anything he puts his mind to but it’s hard to prove to people because you talk over their head.  Most companies want degrees to get good jobs and even then you are not guaranteed so feel like giving up on school.  I am more of an entrepreneur and do not really like authority.  Not in an unlawful sort of way.  My issue is self confidence and drive.  I feel like the beaten wife who keeps going back to her husband.  That is what my job feels like.  But it pays the bills and don’t have the self confidence and drive to find something better because of the possibility of rejection.

Married to my wife for 8 years.  No kids even tho we want one but trying to time it right.  Money, school and such.  My main dream in life is to do something with cars.  Race, fix, build things like that.  I love German and Italian cars.  I have a doctor friend who has several Porsche’s and Ferrari’s who lets me drive them but I want one of my own to race and become a professional.  You know they say you can be anything you want to be? I don’t believe in that.  So much so I have given up in my dreams.  Oh your too old for that.  You will never have the money to do that.  My wife wants children and I do too but I am scared out of my mind not having enough money when I am elderly and also resenting the fact that I might not have gotten the chance to follow my dream because of money issues.  

Anti depressants are not working like they have been.  Taking testosterone shots to help with low t.  Feel like I am out of options.  Feel like I do not want to be on earth but also at the same time I fear god and hell so I would never do anything so I feel sort of stuck.  Sort of being in a glass bowl looking out at the world wishing I was one of the ones successful.  And yes, I do believe wealth is a sign of success.  People that say it isn’t is saying it to make you feel better about your situation.  If you cannot pay your bills and live comfortably, then you will be stressed and depressed.  ",0

I  mean how does anybody live with fact that everybody who they care about  can leave them at any second? How does anybody live with all this chaos  in the world? In today's society, we are essentially pitted against  each other in the grand colosseum of capitalism, where we're tossed  around by our circumstances, constantly being broken down by each other.  I mean like at the end of the day, we're all just looking out for  ourselves, and that idea makes me feel so fucking lonely, that we're  going to have to screw over and be screwed over by people who we do and  are supposed to be able to trust, people we care about.

How does anybody live in this cruel world. There is no good, and at the end of the day, we're all going to die.

Think of the person who you care about the most. Think about how much that person means to you.

Now  think about how one day, you're going to talk to them for the last  time, you're going to see them for the last time, and that'll be it. And  when that happens, you'll either feel nothing, because they no longer  mean what they used to mean to you, or you'll feel extremely guilty that  you hurt them like a fucking psychopath, or they'll have just died for  whatever reason the universe has decided, and you'll have suddenly lost  them permanently.

Nothing that is good lasts forever. The only thing that is certain is that one day, we all die. And you know what, I'm ready.

Take me.

I'm  going to wake up tomorrow morning, and feel completely fine, and then  slowly crash throughout the day. Every day feels like a spiral  downwards, a free fall, but with random jerks left and right. I'll start  out like a normal person, and slowly go insane, and repeat that for the  rest of my life.

So I’m sixteen and this is it. 
So I’ve been dealing with a lot of shit the last year of my life. I started feeling sad for no reason and then every possible way I was fucked over. 

I watched a man die in a motorbike accident and was the first on his body, and I tried to keep him alive for 30+ minutes before an ambulance arrived. 

My cousin who I grew up with and loved, who was two years older than me died in a car accident barely two weeks from the motorbike accident and I then had to speak at his funeral and deal with the death of someone I loved. 

Then I watched my grandfather have his own tractor roll on top of him and kill him. And I had to comfort my entire family, especially my dad who all could not handle the death. And had to speak at his funeral as well. 

I have a fucked leg and have been on crutches for 1.5 years all up. And the day after my grandfather died I had to have another surgery. And it keeps me from doing everything, which then makes me even more depressed. 

And now I am in one of the worse places I’ve ever been in my life. My parent have just split as well. And I struggle to get over 4 hours sleep. Every time i stare at the darkness of my room I remember the bodies of the people I have watched die, moments with my cousin, my parents, and how much of a fuck up I am now. And I can’t deal. I want to die. But I know I can’t. I can’t do it to my family and friends. Especially after all they have been through. 

And I have just spoken to a friend about going to see a doctor behind my parents back ( I’m too scared to tell them, and I can’t put them through it) about getting anti depressants or counselling. But I’m sketchy about anti depressants as they were the supposed cause of my other grandfathers suicide. But I don’t know what do to. I can’t keep living like this.

429,"I've struggled with depression, anxiety, ADHD for years now. For awhile it was something I just lived with. I had expected my situation and never did anything to help myself, the only times I had reached out before did not work and set me off counciling for years. Now a 20 year old first year college student I found myself doing poorly and struggling on the day to day. Things changed when I asked one of my professors for an option out of our in class participation mark due to my crippling social anxiety. He said that I should make an appointment with a Counciler and ended up walking me down there because he knew I wouldn't on my own. Fast forward a few sessions and I'm not doing better but it's a start, me at the beginning of the year never would have done anything like this, I've been making appointments with others at the school to figure out how to fix the situation I've started by doing so poorly in school due to depression, lack of motivation, anxiety, and ADHD which I have gotten a prescription renewed for the first time in years. I got registered at a local mental health focused clinic in town and will see my gp next week to discuss medication options and will follow up at the other clinic if need be. I've taken a couple of mental health days to sort out basic needs like a hair cut and getting myself running shoes to stop being inactive. I've aloud myself to be vulnerable infront of my counciler and a social worker at the clinic which is something I don't ever do, mind you I didn't cry I just wept but again it's a start. I've still been depressed and on edge, even more so than usual the last couple days as this has been happening, as well it's still hard to get up in the morning and I still can't stand the whole time I'm in the shower but now I put on deodorant  and make sure my teeth are brushed well. Again it's a start. I've been a nervous wreck but I'm trying, and I'm so thankful for the professionals from my professor to everyone who is working to help me. before I started writing this I didn't think I had done anything but now I have tears in my eyes realizing how hard this journey has been and how much harder it will get, but things will get better, I just have to fight, and fight I will.",0

435,"I spoke to the head coaches older brother just now. (Aril 3, 2019 10-11pm)  


Let's give names to these coaches.  
rapist: R  
Head coach: H

Brother of Head Coach: B

Let's go back in the past a little bit.

B was there for me when I confronted R. B was on my side. He was really disappointed in my rapist since R was a coach too. B asked me what I wanted to do. If I wanted my rapist to be fired. I couldn't give a straight answer but this is in line of what I said that day:

""I want him to get fired but at the same time I know what H is going through. I know that R is the only full time coach and if he got fired, it would ruin H since we don't have that many coaches. So I can't let that happen. I just want to confront R about what he did and hopefully owns up to what he did.""  


But R replied with anger:  
""I didn't do anything. You wanted this. You were flirting with me. I have the texts to prove that.""  


So I replied:  
""I have the text where you begged me not to tell the coaches because you said that 'it will ruin you. please, the gym is my life.' I can go to the cops about this, but I can't let my parents find out. I can't make them worry about this. And I don't want to be responsible of ruining peoples lives.""  


He completely shut down and changed demeanor when I told him I still had that text. I think B realized who was telling the truth in that moment. But in fact, I lost that text due to a need to reboot my phone so that my dad could use it. I no longer have evidence.  


Now back to the present:  


B heard from H's gf about what I told her so he texted me saying ""I thought that whatever happened to you and R was over""  


So I replied:  
""It's not. Mentally and emotionally it's not. I pretend that everything is fine but it's not. I don't go to the gym anymore because he's there. I thought I would be fine but I'm not. I thought I could forget it but I can't. I keep seeing his face in my head and I keep reliving those days.""  


So he tells me to not go to the gym anymore. So I will stop feeling the way I feel. So the drama could be over.  


I felt betrayed. I felt alone. I felt like he was protecting him just because they're best friends. So I argued that it's not about how I can't work out, its about the fact that he gets to live normally, while I cried every night, while I contemplated about taking my life every night, while I still relive those dark times. While he goes back to the life he lived like nothing ever happened.   


I felt like I was an inconvenience to them. That I'm not worth any action.

&amp;#x200B;

It's been hard keeping myself away from that gym since everyone there were the first friends I've ever made since I moved here. They were my second family. But I guess I wasn't to them.  


""Just stay away from the gym from now on.""   


Fine. I'll start my revenge from afar. Nothing bad I promise. But because of this, I'm too scared to go to other gyms in fear that this will happen again. I'll figure out how to build my own MMA gym. A better one. One that's not full of rusty equipment and minds. One with professionals you can trust. One where we put our customers safety above what we lack. One that everyone can trust.   


So I guess this is where the saying ""when a door closes, another one opens"" comes in.   


But in all honesty, how hard is it to find another coach to replace another? You can search while R is still coaching then fire him as soon as you found another right? I think I'm becoming bitter now, I'll stop.  


So yeah, what better way to come after a business than to become or make a better one.   


At the same time... it'll only bring me temporary joy. My revenge plan no longer seems worth the effort. I'm sorry.",0

437,"How does one go about this? Is it simply a matter of going to my doctor and suggesting a start on them, or is there more involved that I'm not considering? I've done my research on my family and what has worked historically for them, as well as consulted trusted family members in pharmaceuticals for where to start and such. 

I feel like this is the time for me to start. I have followed self help books on nutrition, exercise, and diet. I've even been to visit a cognitive behavioral therapist throughout the past year approximately, and I'm still not getting out of this dark fog to the degree I feel is necessary to continue.

438,"I'm sure there's a reason for this and I'm just unsure of it. But basically up until February of this year, I felt like absolute garbage. I was sad, lazy, tired all the time, anxious, unmotivated, and had suicidal thoughts often. I couldn't think good thoughts about myself or my life. I couldn't feel confident or thankful for anything. I spent much of my time thinking about killing myself. I did not set goals or work to make changes in my life because I figured I would die young anyway. Through some type of fucking miracle, I started working out recently. Nothing crazy, just hikes and very basic workouts at the gym. Right after I started, I got this sudden jolt of energy and calmness. I felt so good. I felt clearheaded, confident, happy, motivated, and excited for things to come for the first time in years. I have no idea why this happened. I found myself not wanting to die anymore. Now I've kind of lost that. I don't feel anywhere close to as good as I felt for a few weeks but I don't feel anywhere close to how bad I used to feel. I kind of don't feel anything at all. I just want to know if anyone else has had similar experiences. It's scary to feel numb.

440,"I'm 18 now. I've suffered with depression since I was a fairly young child. The worst of it being when I was 14-16. I had three suicide attempts and had generally given up on life. After the last attempt I decided that I was gonna try harder to get better for my moms sake. And I did and eventually it stopped being about her and started being about me being actually happy. I got off my medications and started going to therapy once a month rather than once a week. 

I've been very sick the last few months. My digestive system hasn't been working right and I haven't had a chance to go to the doctor because I'm always working. I've gained a lot of weight in the past two months and I've developed consistent acne which I've never dealt with to this extent. I used to struggle with an eating disorder and I still struggle with body image issues. So this has just made my self esteem plummet. 

It's taken a toll on my relationship. My boyfriend gets frustrated with how distant I am and although he doesn't blame me for it, I haven't had much of a sex drive lately and I know that's somewhat difficult for him as well. He tries really hard to get out of the house and do stuff and get frustrated when I don't really want to but it's so hard just to find the energy to get out of bed. I almost ended the relationship because of how much I hate myself right now. Which I don't want to do, but I feel like I've caused so much damage that it'll never be the same. 

I've been super irritable. Everything sets me off and I have a hard time controlling my anger. I don't mean to take it out on the people around me. I know it's my fault. But I still get angry at them. 

I've been doing so good for years now that with me being at such a low point, I have no clue how to handle it anymore. I'm so tired all the time. It's a chore just trying to wake up. I've been trying to keep a happy face as much as I can for the people around me but that's so draining as well. I feel suicidal, and although I know that I won't actually take action on that, it's so hard to find motivation when you feel that way. I hate myself and I just feel worse when I end up hurting the people I love because of it. ",0
441,"Hey guys.   

I've been taking lexapro now for a few months and I've been regularly going to therapy. Also I've been going to the gym and hanging out with my friends alot more, rather than just staying in my room playing overwatch. But I think the medication made the biggest difference. I feel completely different.   

I am in college and the past two semesters have been rough. I thought I was just stupid or lazy or whatever. I couldnt remember things well, I couldn't focus very well.  

Now thats completely different. It feels like my brain was surrounded by a mist and the meds cleared it. I remember things clearly. I get my work done, I can just sit down, say I gotta do this assignment, and I can usually do a respectable amount of work right there.  

My mind is all of a sudden incredibly sharp. I am so creative and witty and I love it. I was already witty/funny (not trying to brag but its one of my features im pretty confident in) but now its on a completely different level, I surprise myself with the things I come up with sometimes. Today someone said I was the funniest person they ever met (which makes me feel so good) And as for creativity, I can come up with solutions to problems in classes or in my clubs, and they are actually good ideas often.

Its been so long since I've felt this way. Today I was talking to my friends a little bit about it, and they say they've noticed the change as well. Now, I pressed them about it because I wasn't sure if they were just saying that to make me feel better. But they convinced me. I asked how they could tell and they said two things: I smile a lot more. And its something in my eye. One friend said they are just more vibrant.  

&amp;#x200B;

I  just feel generally more confident. I'm looking people in the eye when I walk, not just staring at my feet. I can talk to strangers without worrying so much about it. I can make mistakes without them jumbling around in my head all week. I'm not focusing on my flaws all the time, and the flaws I do recognize just dont seem that big a deal (which is insane because I used to obsess ALOT)  

&amp;#x200B;

  

&amp;#x200B;

Now I have a question for anyone whos been through a similar situation: How do I stay this way? Because I was near this level of content before a while ago and lost it, but now I feel really really good (probably better than ever) and I dont want to lose it. Please  give me advice/tips, I really cant go back to how I felt before.",0
442,"I've struggled with severe depression for about a year (I have dealt with depression throughout my life), and it's been worse and more frequent than before in my life. I've been to therapy and recently I've been feeling as if I'm on the verge of turning it back around. 

I think the main barrier for me right now is communicating with my partner. 

When I am alone, I feel encouraged and hopeful, but as soon as I get home, I fall back into the cycle. I don't tell her about the hope I felt. I know she would love to hear I have been feeling better, but  I feel emotionally paralyzed and I don't know how to communicate it to her. Because of that, my hope dissipates at home and I feel like everything goes back to ""normal"".

Somewhere in my head, there's a wall I've built between her and I. I think it was originally meant to protect her from the darker parts of my depression, but I am concerned now it is preventing me from communicating the positive things also. I need to begin disassembling this wall.

443,"This is a lesson that I have had to learn the hard way. It doesn’t matter from who or from what, but you can’t be stuck in the middle or you’ll drown. Depression can make you feel horrible in all sorts of incomprehensible ways, and it’s even worse when you want to try and break out of that rut because you want those feelings gone asap, but that is not how it works. Life is hard, and not just for those of us that have mental illness. We make mistakes. We experience heartbreak and tragedy. But you can’t stay in the middle when you realize that you’re feeling this way. We need to try harder than most to move forward, even if our progress isn’t always tangible or we don’t feel better right away. I have been in this place before, and I found a way to move forward with less than what I have now, so as much as this sucks I know that it is possible. And I know that it is possible for all of you as well. You have to will yourself to move on from those who are toxic, who don’t care about you, who can’t have you on their lives, or whatever the case may be. It can be very hard depending on who that person is to you, but it must be done. Life will not wait for you. Those people will not wait for you. And the middle will consume you while you wait to start swimming. Like I said, I am right now here with you, but I know that we can all do this. We will not just die. ",0

Well, first of all, there is a huge difference between being depressed and having depression. If you don’t understand it, you whole article is going to be rubbish, naturally.

453,"TL;DR: I had some suicidal thoughts, and over a week later my therapist sections me - despite the treatment plan we had in place, and knowing how much i've been trying (successfully) to get through it. I now have no therapist, no partial program, and a lot of anger at the whole mental health system. 

Two weeks ago, I was having a pretty rough time. Previously, a med change had left me so sleepy I could barely get to classes, so in addition to struggling to get my work done I was falling behind. I had a plan, though - I'd worked with my teachers to get back on track, I was in therapy, and I had a new job lined up. I thought I was in my last rough patch, and even though I'd have to do a lot of work to get through the semester, I felt like I could do it. 

Enter my ex. Though we'd split up almost 6 months ago, we still talked from time to time. He was the only person I knew in my city, and when I needed help I'd turn to him. I thought he was such a nice person for agreeing to help me -- though eventually he'd do something to remind me why we split up. He came over two weeks ago, and we stayed up late watching netflix. 

I woke up to him pulling my hand down his pants, with my own leggings half-off. 

I was disgusted - with him and with myself. Worse, I knew I'd lost my only friend. 

So I decided I was done with it all. I made plans, and the next day I thought I would go through with them. I didn't, obviously. I called my mom, and we drove back home. I knew I couldn't go back to school and guarantee that I'd be safe, so we started looking at a medical leave of absence. 

A week later, I'd seen my meds person and my therapist. We'd decided that a partial program would be a good next step for me, and it would help with securing the leave of absence. I had a place, and I was due to start Monday. 

Cut to last Saturday -- and this is where shit really starts going down. 

My mom comes in to talk to me, says that she has spoken to my therapist. Although I don't remember giving my therapist permission to talk to her, they spoke about me. My mom had her own concerns about me, and shared them with my therapist.

This was over a week after I was at that low point, and I was doing pretty well, relatively. The new meds were starting to work, and I wasn't having many side effects. 

It's important to note that hospital has always been traumatic for me. After my last inpatient stay I've had to deal with panic attacks any time I think about what it'd be like to go back there. There's no fucking chance I'm ever going inpatient again, and that fear was partly what led me to call my mom before things got even worse, and what made me accept that I need to go on leave from school. I was even struggling with the decision to go to a partial program, but I wanted to get better and give my family some peace of mind, so I'd accepted that it was a good next step for me. 

But apparently this desire to get better and get the most out of a partial program wasn't enough for my crazy therapist. Two hours after she called my mom, she called again to say that she was sectioning me, and that an ambulance would be at my house soon to take me to ER. 

I'm angry beyond belief at this point. I've been to the ER before for this sort of thing, and I know what a long, impossible process it can be. My mom knows how much panic hospitals create for me - she was there last time I was inpatient, when I was under 18. 

I know I have to keep my shit together if I'm going to stay out of an inpatient program, though, so I push the anger away until I can get home. 

I'm in the ER for SIX HOURS, wearing flimsy scrubs and watched by a security guard, before I get to see a social worker. Luckily, she's a rational person, and she agrees that my therapist was out of line to section me, especially since we had a treatment plan set up and I'd been safe throughout everything. I get home from the hospital, cry for a few hours, and finally fall asleep around 3 am. I was supposed to work the opening shift at my job, but apparently my therapist doesn't care about how working makes me feel better, and thought my situation was so dire I'd kill myself if I wasn't inpatient - despite seeing me earlier in the week, going on about getting out of negative feedback loops, and me expressing the desire to get better. (I'm still in shit with my boss about missing that shift - thanks for starting another loop, asshole!) 

I sleep, cry, and seethe throughout most of Sunday. I console myself with the knowledge that the partial program will at least get me a therapist close to home, and that my therapist can't do any more damage to my recovery now. 

On Monday morning I wake up to a phone call from the partial program I was supposed to start later that day, and they say that they can no longer take me, since my ex-therapist has told them I need to be inpatient. I try to explain that I was evaluated at the ER and they agreed a partial program was appropriate, but apparently they have some protocol that means they can't take me with my therapist's note on file. 

So now I have no therapist and no partial program. I've called around and it looks like I might be able to get into some programs next week, but honestly I don't fucking want to go. I don't even want another therapist. I'm so hurt that someone I thought I could trust, someone who was supposed to be looking out for me, could fuck everything up based on the worries of an overprotective mother, despite me trying my absolute best to get out of this fucking pit of depression I've found myself in. I tried so fucking hard, reddit, and I'm in a worse position now than when I started. It's harder to keep the thoughts away, too. I don't have anyone in my life that I trust anymore. 

To top it all off, I need to spend hours on the phone chasing down leads for a new partial program or a new therapist who can see me twice a week, because if I don't I won't be able to go on medical leave. I'm so exhausted, angry, and sad. I just wanted to get better - why is it so hard? I thought having a therapist was supposed to help me deal with having suicidal thoughts, not try to force me inpatient. I don't know what to do anymore.

I feel like my depression has become a huge burden to my family and partner. I’m terrified of what will happen when I can longer even do my job and support myself. 

I’m starting to think a lot about death and dying and how maybe I’m just not meant to be alive. How maybe it will be better if I was dead that living as this shell of a person. 

TLDR: my treatment resistant depression is ruining my career and relationships. I don’t know if there’s a point to living anymore. ",0
455,"Please help.

I had a shitty day and cried at school, which actually for once led to me to being in a counsellor's office, and for some reason I actually told them I thought I was depressed.

I really fucked up. Now my parents know and my mother's arranged an appointment with a GP. And I'm still doubting if I'm actually depressed. I think I probably am (constantly tired/miserable, can't go one day without thinking about suicide, randomly crying, not being able to interact properly with people) but I still might not be.

I want antidepressants but I don't think the GP will give them to me, since I have no idea how to 'prove' I'm depressed or how to even describe it. I'm also 15 and it'll probably be blamed on teenage angst.

I really need advice.",0

i wish i knew what happened. what made me lose grip on school. i've lost my memory, my reasoning, my logic, all of the things that i held to such high esteem. now, though, that's all gone, and i don't have anything i excel at anymore. i don't have anything that i can use to help me. i don't have anything at all, really. no real friends, no real family, no real support. sure, i see people at school, and i talk to people around 5 times a week, but i can't really open up to them. i have a mom, dad, brother, and sister, but they don't care about me. in fact, all of them except my sister despise me. i have a school counselor, but i'm petrified of going to them considering i have no idea who they even are.

459,"I've had depression and social anxiety most of my life but since maybe around 6 or 7 months ago, it actually affected my life because my best friend said really hurtful things to me that made me feel like the most horrible person in the world. I removed her from my life because I had enough of the negativity and I had enough. At first, I felt like a bad person for letting her go especially with her circumstance. Right now, it finally felt the right thing to do.

I'm having a hard time moving on since I still ""hear"" her words she had said to me in the past as well as other traumas. 

Recently, 3 months ago, I decided it's time for me to become a better person again and I had analyzed on what kind of person I want to be and made goals. Currently, I have no friends, never been in a relationship before, graduating from college soon, not able to find a job, planning to get into graduate program after a gap year. 

The biggest frustration is...I'm barely making progress with achieving my goal. I just don't have the energy. Everyday, it's like...
""Okay! I'm gonna be that kind of person I want to be today. I will smile and say hi to many people I know! I'll make friends in no time"" 

*walks out the door*

""sigh...I'm tired...everyone hates me, I wanna go home. Everyone is looking at their phones forgetting I exist. Everyone thinks I'm lazy""

I lose my motivation the moment I go out of my home. I'm still figuring out what is holding me back.

Is there any tip or advice that help you to make progress in your goal rather the process is short or long?",0

461,"I’m so tired guys. 

I’m tired of being boring. 

I don’t have any real friends anymore. The ones I do/did have always seem so bored when they talk to me. They sigh, or give me this look like “get on with it.” 
My ex-best friend is, for some odd reason, just outright easier to talk to. Easier to chit chat, laugh and have fun with. We’ll be standing next to each other, and friends we both know very well will talk to her over me, then look at me and say, 

“oh hey, Shibeyu. How long have you been here?”

The whole time, is the answer.

I try to mold into a person like her. 
I try to make the same jokes, do the same things, 

But everyone looks at me like I’m the odd one. She does them, and everyone basically claps and applauds. Laughing. 

It’s so obvious when another friend of ours is with her. 
He won’t speak to me when I’m alone, without her, despite us knowing each other for the past 8 years. But when she’s around? A whole new him. This may sound like he likes her, but, if that’s the case, alright. I’m happy for you. 

Next, my boyfriend. 
God I love him. He’s helped me and cared for me since the day we got together. 
We used to talk everyday, almost every hour he could, but now, he’s reduced to “mmhm” or sometimes, I just catch him not even listening to me. 
“What? Sorry.”
It really hurts. Coming out of a bad relationship where my ex would just flat out never talk to me was painful.

My parents even.
They seem like even they’re bored with me.

All of this makes me feel just boring and dull.

Like a little gray dot among this sea of colorful people, with their online friends, or the ones that walk beside them. Just absolutely nothing interesting about me. 

Nothing in my life that’s interesting.

Personality is blank. I feel like I mold a new one for each person I mean. 

My art is boring. Nothing astonishing, nothing that lingers in your mind long after you saw it. 

My looks are boring. Brown hair, blue eyes. Dull, pale skin.

I feel just...

Boring. 

It’s eating away at me and I don’t know what to do or what to feel.

Can I fix myself? Can I make myself exciting?? Can I make myself interesting?

463,"Life is hard. People are so consumed by their lives that they don't have time for other humans. I deactivated my Facebook to exercise, but in a selfish way, I want them to either miss me or move on. Sometimes my friends are not good enough for me.

464,"I used to hate life. I used to cry every day. I used to want to die.

2019 came and I got a new job, only working 3 days a week making the same as my other jobs where I had to work every day.

Working makes me depressed.

So this job helped, I had a lot of free time. I liked another job where I worked 4 days. It was 2 days, day off, 2 days, then the weekend. It helped me so much. This one is good like that.

People act like I have it easy, and yeah I do. I love my job, thats why I am happy now. I felt joy again. I went out and plays pokemon go, I cought a bunch of pokemon. I do battles and raids. It makes me so happy. But it hurts that everyone had to bag on me constantly. I make the same money as before, so this... isn't a bad thing. I'm going to talk and see if I can get more hours, I want 4 days instead of 3.

I stopped crying every day. I was happy. I felt good.

But... things changed.

Everyone is on me about it. I can't complain to people because they all make fun of me for working only 3 days. I never complain about working too much, just... like how annoying a customer was, or how rude the manager is.

I don't cry. I don't hate life. I don't want to die. I feel it in the back of my head. I don't want to die, but I am going to kill myself. I don't hate life, but I don't want this life and I hope it doesn't last long. I dont cry but i feel the anxiety.

Every day I count down the days to go back to work. I feel anxious.

The days used to go by fast and I loved it.

The days go by fast now and I hate it. Longer days please. More time to lay in bed please. Please.

It doesn't hurt anymore to live. I just don't want to live anymore.

Recently my buddy drove me home and decided to hang out with me instead of going back to go to dinner with our buddies.

He doesn't know but I was going to hurt myself. I was going to try to kill myself. And he insisted on staying. Maybe he knew? I've changed recently. Everyone's seen it.

I used to do whatever, whatever someone said I did it. Then suddenly I enjoyed hanging out with everyone, even suggesting things or places to go. Then I started shutting myself in. I didn't want to go out. I had to be home and get ready for work the next day. I would slightly hang out on non work days, but dont count on the day before work again.

And it annoys them. My buddy sat on the couch with me and told me I was going ro hang out with them the next day so be prepared. Having that day to prepare helped. I didn't kill myself that night. I went to dinner with them the next day. I had a good time. I made it through the day.

It doesn't hurt anymore, and I'm making it one day at a time, but it's hard. I feel like it should hurt, but I can't feel the pain.",0
465,"For the last couple of month I have tried everything in my power to deal with my depression I have had since I was 15 years old, I am in my 20s now. In 2014 I finally made progress and got my self an education, I was so proud of my self, then in 2015 I was almost raped by a guy who beat me up and left me unconcious on the floor in my hallway with a broken pinky and ripped clothes because I didn't want to sleep with him and just like that, all progress went down the drain. I was placed in a mental institution for month and month, I don't remember how long it was, time is a blur to me. 

I fought it and got better, and then I entered into an internship at a nursing home to ease my self slowly and safely back out to the world, and after a few month of me being a stable individual, I vitnessed the most wicked and evil thing I have ever seen, a superior worker who worked at night with me, told a different worker not to react on a fever that an elderly person had and to let that person die becuase they needed to make room for a new person due to a long list of applications. She saw me in the door and told me if I told anyone she would destroy my life, then she left. I got an anxiety attack and almost passed out, I cried and called the one resposible for the nursing home and told her everything and quit. Got into a mental institution once again. 

No matter what I have done, I've been smacked down and that is okay, some people just can't live and I am one of those. People always say, ''shit happens'' or ''get over it'', really? Is this what I am fighting for? Is this the life I shouldn't take for granted and have to take care of? As if I am about to lose a great deal of happiness coming my way at some random point in my life with no garantie? sigh...

There is nothing I want from life at this point, and I don't think being depressed is the wrong thing, but rather that people who are depressed have seen what life is and cry for what they wanted it to be due to all the bs you get taught growing up, ''you can be anything, you can do anything, people are good at the core'', no, no and no. 

People are careless, thourghtless and destructive.

Most will disagree with me and that's fine, but know this, I have sat next to a dying woman on christmas eve and held her hand as her sons wouldn't come and say goodbye to her because they were to busy, and they asked me, ''can't you just call when it's over with?''. Just writing this here makes my stomach ache.

I've come to understand that humanity is flawed beyond repair and I want nothing to do with it. There is now no goal on my horizon, my parents and boyfriend suffers due to my descend into darkness for the fact that I accept it fully and I can't claw my way out this time and I won't.

I have robbed my parents of the experience of being parents with a little happy family as I have been different and sad always. I can never forgive my self for that and I won't ever try to, I deserve this guilt. 

There is no getting out on the otherside, there is no green grass for me, is that my own fault? Probably, but I don't see how you can find a happy place in your mind unless you neglect everything real and become a mindless individual, and I can't do that.   
I have seen the worst in people and I have felt evil being acted out on me for no reason other than personal gain.

I do not seek empathy nor any cheering on, I just needed an outlet as I have been silent for all of these years and I don't know if I get to say anything to people I care about as I am mute when asked about anything about me. This is my safety if I decide to go, so people who know me and care for me have a chance to find this and understand how life is through my eyes and maybe then they will be able to accept it better.

473," Hey guys. I was suffering from depression for a while (like 2 years) and I struggled a lot everyday to battle against it without medicines and treatment, but it was kind of impossible to fight it alone. I didn't have a happy day for a looooong time, but now I'm free and I'm so, so, sooo much happier.
 Over a week ago my wife decided to go away and left me alone in our house because she didn't love me anymore. I was a depressed guy that was unhappy everyday and she couldn't handle it. We weren't happy. 
 We didn't talk since then and suddenly, on the third day that she left, I felt happy again. After a long, long time I just felt something again!       
 Sometimes we can't see what is causing our depression and we think it's just our brain or that is our fault on something.
All I can say is that I'm finally free and happy. I couldn't see it was my marriage that was so toxic and causing it. Actually, I knew it was, but I didn't want to see.
 I started to reconnect with all of my GOOD friends and now I see I have quite a lot of them that I wasn't talking to, because my wife was so possessive. I'm going out everyday, well dressed now, not like a homeless like I was doing before. 
I even went to a party on sunday and kissed a girl there. I was so confident and started to talk with her and we suddenly started kissing.
 I'm running one hour a day on the threadmill and eating less and better. I'm working more and I'm not playing any videogames. I'm just a new man.

tldr: I'm better in every aspect of my life after my marriage came to an end. That was the cause of my depression and I couldn't see it. I wish you guys can get better and feel happy again, like I am.

I went, and it didn’t really help at all, all he did was recommend therapy and a counselor to talk to. I went in there wanting to try medication for depression since just overall talking to people about my problems don’t really help long term for me. So, My mother called a few places around here to get me set up with someone and they all said it would be at least 2 months, I was very sad that I couldn’t talk to someone and things just kept getting worse and worse. Fast forward, it’s been that 2 months and my mom never made a appointment like I thought she did. Me and her were talking and she said something like how about I just bring you to the hospital because me and her were arguing , I wasn’t against that and then she said she wouldn’t bring me. Now, she made an appt with her doctor office for me to go , and I went to the dr there, and he prescribed me sertraline (Zoloft). This was Monday, so I’m on day 2 of taking it. I can only take 25 mg for 6 days so I can get use to it then I go to 50. Is there a certain time frame I can notice any changes and actually see if it works?

480,Now I know a lot of people don’t seem to think ghosting is a big deal so let me just give some context as to why it’s so important to me. I’ve had  anxiety since I was a child. In my recent years it’s become even worse for me. Throughout high school I didn’t even talk to anyone or approach anyone therefore I had no friends. The very few friends I did make we just grew apart and some I just had falling outs with. Some even ghosted me. About a year ago I made a friend on Xbox. At first we just played games but then we started texting every day and played pretty much every day as well. We would watch movies on Netflix and talk in a party together. We talked for hours and hours. I made it clear to them I had anxiety and that’s why it was a struggle for me to talk to them and they understood that. Throughout our friendship both of us would come to eachother to vent because neither of us had many friends. Also we texted constantly as well. Most people would consider us “clingy” but it was fine with eachother. He would text me every day and I would text him everyday as well.The last time he texted me I didn’t even notice at first because towards the end of our friendship I had been busy trying to get things going in my career but I still texted him everyday even if it was a few texts. Then I noticed the last text he sent me sounded like he was going to attempt suicide. I tried to contact him because I was worried something had happened. The last text he messaged me made me worry because he had mentioned to me that he had tried suicide attempts in the past. They also unfriended everyone on Xbox so it wasn’t just me he was singling out or so I thought. A day ago I found out I was blocked because I was on my friends account and looked up his account to see if he had posted or anything and noticed he was on and still had other people friended. I instantly knew that he ghosted me. I’ve had so many thoughts as to why. Maybe I was clingy but he texted me just as much and if I didn’t text for 1 day he’d say he missed me. Maybe it was because I had a lot of issues and therefore vented a lot to him. But he also vented to me constantly and whenever I would vent he would make it about himself. I constantly supported him and reassured him everything was ok and he was a great person. Maybe something happened in his life and doesn’t feel like talking to anyone. But he’s still talking to other Xbox friends. Maybe it was because he liked me more than a friend but knew I didn’t want to be anything more than friends because he would compliment me and I would compliment him as well and he would also draw me and I don’t mean 1 or 2 drawings but much more. We also had pet names for eachother. Regardless of the reason now I will never know. I’m hurt that he blocked me when throughout our friendship he would beg me to never block him even if I didn’t want to talk to him anymore. And now I’m left without any closure and the only friend I had left is gone. I’m still shocked because we reassured eachother we would be friends for a long time because we both had trust issues from friends in the past. I’m deeply hurt now and I don’t know what to do. I don’t want to try contacting through another Xbox account to ask why because I feel that would be wrong. But I’m lost and I want closure. And because he blocked me I will leave my last words to him here: I understand if you never wanna talk to me again. I accept that. I’m just glad I had your friendship even if it was for a short time. I want you to know that you were a great friend. And one day I hope that you talk to me again and give me a reason as to why you ghosted me. You knew how hurt I was at getting ghosted in the past. You knew I had anxiety and other issues and especially trust issues. Please. I just want to know why. ,0

This is the only place I can turn now... other than my piano, I have nothing and no one to confide in.",0
485,"I have decided to come onto reddit because I am sick of nobody helping, understanding or listening. I really would like some advice and reasons from you kind souls, i just want to know why i feel this way, and why so much damage exists in me, so if you could help that would be amazing. ill provide some context. I am a 20 year old British Pakistani girl living in the UK. I grew up in a very broken home, witnessing domestic violence and countless arguments between my parents, as well as a bullying older sister and acting as a referee and go-fer between my parents’ marriage for the duration of my life. My mother was emotionally distant and had manic depression for the duration of my childhood and my dad was bad with his temper at times too. For some strange reason all my life, since I was 6,7 the only thing i have dreamt of having a boy love me. having a boy make me feel special, having a boy marry me and give me this normal beautiful life. Alongside this, in terms of the love thing, I’ve been in love three times. And every boy I fell for has never ever  felt the same way back. i have always been the “piece on the side” and the other girl, and have been taken advantage of my whole life. I always get rejected because of how i look, or who i am. i absolutely despise myself. This is because I always settle for being the side piece, I know they only want me for sex and also, money. but i feel like that’s some form of attention, in some way. I recently came out of a very messy friends with benefit situation, where he was not only using me for sex for 3 years, but for money. i come from a wealthy family and offered my support when he needed it, and he abused that in the worst way, but for all i knew, i was just trying to buy his love. I loved him like I never loved anybody, he gave me physical attention, I lost my virginity to him, he swore blind he cared about me for 3 years and he had just been lying about everything all along. i tried to buy his love because i don't have anything else to offer, clearly I don't. I don't have any boys running after me, ever, nobody has ever shown an interest in me or made me feel special, not even my own parents. I don't have anything to offer except money, and lets face it, that is attractive. I have always been “the fat girl”, i was 8lbs when I was born, so i honestly always have been like this its my body, its not out of unhealthy eating or poor lifestyle. I am a size 22 clothing and my body is honestly disgusting, and I know thats a reflection of the fact that I no man has ever felt the same love for me I have them, always been unrequited. I hate myself, my body, but even more, who i am. Im so loud, and annoying, and get attached so quick. Im so desperate for attention, for people to think im this amazing person, so i put on this I used to say when I was 16, 17 years old to my friends that i don't see whats so good about me that someone would want to marry me. i hated myself when i was 16 and i was petrified that when the time came to marry, i wouldn't have anyone. Im now 20, and for those saying i am still young, im really not. My mum (being of pakistani decent) says she wants me to get married by the age of 24,25 and i agree. i would love to get married now and have a boy love me and give me the life iv always dreamed of. im so desperate to be loved guys, i can't sit at weddings knowing that will never be me, i can't scroll through girls getting their bridal makeup done on instagram, i block any happy couples i see. I don't see anyone falling for me ever. they haven't in 20 years and i don't see myself changing in the next year, so why would someone come. i have had this fear since i was 15 and now the day is coming so close. The last boy i loved was the only person who really knew me, and vice versa, and i wanted to marry him so much. He knew me inside and out, saw the real disgusting me and left. I don't see why anyone would want a fat, ugly, disgusting personalities ike myself, which is why every boy iv gone for has never ever felt the way back. Guys don't like fat girls. i am joining the gym but that can't change my personality which seems to deter everyone away. i have tried counselling but it never works, they just say oh you are young you'll meet someone. but it had to be now, im already late. for me it takes years to get to know someone id marry, years. if i met someone now we could get married for 23/24, my dream would be complete. any one iv met in the past iv always showed them with gifts, money, and favours, and thats the only thing that defined our relationships. They used me. But money and gifts are the only thing i have to offer, i have nothing else but i have that. so i use that to try and get them to love me, i thought if they see how good my heart is when i give them money and spoil them, they will love me back. I do suffer from depression since I was 15 now and Have had PTSD since I was 14, when I witnessed my mum try and knife my dad, and herself. Iv got no friends, never had a boyfriend, hate myself and can't see marriage happening, i need to meet someone now so i can have my perfect life, i don't feel like i would have any depression or anxiety or problems period if someone loved me, every bit of emptiness in my life would just be gone. Why am i like this guys? please someone offer me some advice or practicalities. thank you x",0

I have now been thinking about this, and I am starting to believe I was only doing it for the attention. I have these episodes, and I show symptoms of depression. I never tried to intentionally use my mood and emotions to manipulate or deceive anyone else though. I have done harm to myself. I have genuinely thought to myself how much of a failure I was. And the list goes on. These mood swings do happen when certain conditions are met, and these episodes last for at least 2 weeks. In general, I am not really happy with myself with anything. I even go out of my way to talk crap about myself, even if my friends tell me I am a good person. And I have not put any faith in myself, or even care about myself. I have told others I do not care about myself, and it would remain that way, no matter what they said.

489,"## Part 1: The Reason People End Their Life (Plus Part 2: How to Save Yourself)

## The Reason Why People End Their Life

I know what it’s like to feel that ending it is the natural next step. How f’d up is that? That thinking suicide is the next step? Like it makes sense to end it. That moment is what prompted me to reach out and talk to someone. But not everyone has that insight when they’re that deep in the dark, murky little hole we label as “depression”. Like a cave that lures you in. slowly. Making you think that following it into the darkness is the way to go.

I’ve heard people say that suicide is selfish. But having been close to that edge, I’ll tell you right now, people who are contemplating death aren’t thinking on a level where emotions or standard logic even really apply. We’re just thinking, how do I get out of this hole? What’s the next step? And the darkness is what answers. It’s sinister. Like a siren calling sailors to the sea. So it isn’t really a choice that we make. You can call them selfish, but people don’t just one day become depressed and then boom. They’ve taken their life. Like “screw you, family, and friends”. No. They’re impaired. It takes months, if not years, of feeling as though you’re up to your knees in mud, surrounded by a thick, sound-absorbent fog, 24/7. So it takes a while. And by that time, their mind and emotions are just a tangled, unrecognizable web. So it’s not that they don’t care. It’s just that nothing is rational at that point.

Other times, ya, it can be more sudden. like a person just isn’t equipped to handle stress at all. things might compile quickly and then instead of looking for an exit at the front or back, they take the ejection hatch instead, because the front and back doors still have more problems. Do you see what I mean? But chronic depression? That’s more debilitating. Because it's every single day. And life never stops. They aren't given time to navigate or process what's hurt them. And if a number of things happen before being able to heal from the last insult, it becomes cumulative. It snowballs. So if you ever see someone who strikes you as though they might be struggling, just show them love. Compliments work great. Even from a stranger. Something as simple as holding a door open and smiling at them can be all it takes. Or if it's a friend or family member, just get off their back and interact with them from the heart. Just love. I mean don’t assume they’re thinking of taking their own life, but everyone appreciates a random thoughtful gesture so there’s no harm in a gesture, even if you’re not right about it. But if by chance they are struggling, it's those small, seemingly insignificant gestures that can be all it takes to remind them that hey. there is a light. here it is. and it’s in the opposite direction the darkness is coaxing them. Even if that light appears dim to them at the time, now it’s there. It makes them remember there's another path behind them. They heard your call, albeit muffled. But That's the pivotal point right there.

Most people don’t just pop out of it. It took them a while to get there so it’s going to take a while to get them back out. And it is going to take a ton of effort for them to trudge all the way back. so turning back around has to seem worth it, because they’ve used up all their energy for so long already. they’re depleted. So you need to trickle charge them. One day at a time. gentle persistence.

It’s when people never experience an interjection of light, the people who forgot there even was another path, that’s when they do it. They continue into the darkness. And to them, it just makes sense. Because they’re welcomed by the dark. It’s inviting. and it feels right. good, almost. So they follow it.

After the comments I received on the first post (posted yesterday, and identical to what's written above), I just wanted to add a Part 2 because of how dark the nature of that post was. I reposted the original (above) but added this second part so I could change the title of the main post to hopefully reach more people. Please stay with me.

&amp;#x200B;

PART 2:

**How You Can Save Your Own Life**

&amp;#x200B;

This part is dedicated to whoever reads this, or is going through this. introspection and self care is what brought me back to a place of calm.

&amp;#x200B;

All of the problems we feel are impacting our mental health are exogenous, meaning they come from outside of us. Once you realize that YOU are a separate entity, you are your OWN entity, the circumstances are severed from you. You realize there's a difference between you and what's happened. You are NOT your circumstances. Circumstances are their own thing. YOU are NOT them. So don't become them. Don't let them trick you into thinking they are you. Start doing things that you simply enjoy, just for the sake of pure enjoyment. If it's sleeping, stop feeling guilty for sleeping and tell yourself, I like this. I am sleeping because I enjoy it. Not because it's an escape. Use little activities to build rungs of a ladder to lift you back out of the pit. And remind yourself you're doing them for the simple fact that they calm you, and you are enjoying them. Whatever they are. And find things about yourself that you like. Stare into the mirror if you have to. That person right there? They're all you've got in life. Don't let them down.

Other people can contribute to your pain, or your healing, But it's up to you to realize that happiness is a choice, and you are being an asshole to yourself. You gotta quit being an asshole to yourself. Tell yourself that. Look into the mirror and tell the dark and mean part of yourself that is tearing you down that they're a fkn jerk and that they're wrong. That you deserve happiness and you're sick of the shit you're feeding yourself. You deserve MORE. you deserve everything. put your foot down. Being an asshole to yourself obviously isn't doing shit for your life. Let's see what being happy can do. Why not? You've got nothing to lose. Lift your eyes up from the sidewalk. If you have to trick yourself into feeling happy and confident, do that. Trick the asshole. Until the authentic you starts appearing naturally. If you see someone happy that you wish you could be like, try pretending like you are happy like them. Act happy like them. Do it for you. And nobody else.

Self care and the following bit are probably the most important thing I could write on this thread. Show yourself some love. Treat yourself as if you were a tiny, fragile puppy. Be gentle, let it breathe, and sniff around. Give it some food. And tell it you love it.

**As crazy as it sounds, negative experiences are not the enemy.**

Do you ever notice how you don't grow from happiness? Sure it's enjoyable, and it feels authentically right, unlike the darkness calling you, which, when i went through that, a part of me still knew it was not sincere. And i know deep down you know it too. But happiness feels the way it does because you've achieved what you were meant to achieve, it's the emotion that tells you you're on the right track. Happiness is the *break* you're *gifted* between life lessons as a way of your higher self telling you ""thanks for listening, here you go. You've unlocked the achievement"". The lessons are served to us in the form of challenges. Like a video game: happiness is the check point. The waves that come at you are like the challenges you have to defeat before you can reach next check point, the next goal you're mean to achieve. What you do in order to get there is what's going to make you stronger.

So personal growth and strength only ever comes from combating negative experiences. They have a purpose, and it's up to you to figure out what you can learn from them. You have to ask yourself what the lesson is. Be curious about it. Stop for a second and apply some thought to it instead of ignoring it. Search for it. Within yourself. Then when you find it, meet it. don't let it bully you. Emotions are a powerful thing.

We NEED negative emotions to tell us what is WRONG in our lives, that we're off our track. They go, ""here, you're going feel a pinch, or a punch even, because this isn't meant for you."" or ""this is close to what you want, but it isn't quite right"". The harder the hit, the more wrong it is, thus, the more you can learn from it, and the more you will grow. Similar to a seed, you *need* darkness to grow. Sounds counterintuitive, but when you think about it, seeds won't sprout without it. They just stay dormant.

But no. You are not a dormant being. What is a seed mean to do? They're meant to grow. And go on to nourish the world around it.

Negative emotions or bad circumstances are the soil. Water is like attention. So if you are a seed, the more attention (water) you give the darkness, the faster you will grow. And then, you'll sprout and reach the sun. Sun is happiness :) Sun is enjoyment :) Sun is calm. and warm. Sun is LIFE. Sun is not found in a cave. or a pit! And a seed isn't meant to sink further and further into the ground. That's not it's purpose. And if you're the seed, it means that sinking isn't your purpose either. Negative emotions are VERY simply YOUR way of telling YOUR SELF that you're off track. That's their purpose. So embrace them. Embrace the dirt, but don't BECOME the dirt. Make the dirt your friend. because without it, you won't grow. So ask yourself what the dirt needs from you instead of seeing it as the enemy. Give it what it needs, and then watch yourself grow.

I had no one to help me out of my hole, no one to tell me these things, but I hope that this thread can be that for you. Please don't stay dormant. Don't keep sinking. This is the light I'm giving to you to remind you of the other path. The path towards the sunlight. Be strong and get through this wave, because the best part about the game is winning. Not defeat. Keep at it. Overcome the waves. Get to the next checkpoint. There is always a next checkpoint.

Why am I 31 and still alone?

I know that this attitude isn’t the answer to my problems but I’m also sitting here in tears just wondering why nothing ever worked out for me.  I know there are those that have less in life than I do, I recognize what I have.  But I also work so hard and I seem to get anywhere.

Goodness I miss the sense of balance. I just man up to carry the consequence of my action. I'm not afraid. There are regrets but I need to move forward.

About myself: Im basically a 16 year old guy, who lived in 4 different countries , 3 different continenets (living in Canada currently) and with no exaggeration, I know something is wrong with me. Started slowly realizing at the age of 14ish that I wasn't really that normal and something was wrong. About my unknown issue (In case I'm lucky enough someone in the profession): It's been two years since again with no exaggeration feel absolutely empty, it's like having a hole in the center of your chest and can't breath properly. Sometimes I have like different personalities, a good and an evil one, music for some reason too affects it somehow. I have no close friends, pretty sure because of how I act or talk. I have thoughts of legitimately becoming big one day out there and sometimes I feel like I would end up failing miserably in life (It's like thoughts in my head, not an actual voice tho). Im not suicidal but I wouldn't mind if I die or someone kills me. What im concerned about rn is that I dont think I can last 2 more years to be 18 and go to a psychiatrist without my parents knowing, like whatever unknown issue I have will become worst. With all due respect I'm not really here to see comments like ""you are not alone"" or ""One day it'll change and be better"" or such. I'm genuinely concerned about my mental state as I'm positive it WILL worsen over time if I didn't get help and if someone could help me answer this question, I will greatly appreciate it.

494,"I can not guarantee my method works for everyone, since we are all different. But why not give a try?

&amp;#x200B;

If I feel tired, then I go to bed sleep with eye mask. However, sometimes though I feel tired, but still can not sleep, then, I use my both hand, touch the bed or the wall, imagine that I am an extension of the bed or the wall, so I have no thought, no thought, no thought, no thought...

&amp;#x200B;

After some time, I feel recovered, then get up, smell the peppermint or lavender oil, the aroma improve my brain activity very fast.

&amp;#x200B;

Then, I do some repeated tasks: For example,

1. cleaning the room
2. ironing the cloths
3. cooking.

...

Anyway, you should do such easy things, which give you a feeling of success after you finished them. You can enjoy the result.

&amp;#x200B;

Don't play a game. Because game need thinking and concentration, but no body activity. After you play the game, there is no feeling of success and proud in your life. You will feel more empty and exhaused, like stopped the drug.

&amp;#x200B;

I think, the reason of the numb state often resulted from over thinking, so the brain is exhausted. Thus you need a balance between the body and mind. That's the reason, why some repeated body tasks without  a lot thing can help you get out of the state. They balance the energy distribution.

&amp;#x200B;

(P.S I don't think, running is always useful for recovery from this numb state, because running doesn't need thinking (it doesn't like cleaning or cooking), so if the brain doesn't have any task, then it will find something to over thinking.  But if you already know how to meditate during jogging, it will be a perfect sport to keep mental health. )

507,"My family always talks about how much of a piece of shit I am. I always hear them talking about me from my room. They say shit like oh he's a lazy piece of shit and they say the only reason I say I'm depressed is because I'm looking for attention. 

I don't have the motivation to do anything anymore, I sit in my room all day and starve myself most day's.

 When they first found out that I hurt myself they yelled at me and said that I was only doing it for attention even though that doesn't make since because I don't even leave my house, and they got mad at me and they started making fun of me for it the next fucking day. (Which they always do). Every time that they find out about something that is genuinely wrong with me they start laughing about it the next day and say I'm faking shit.

 They try to act nice to everyone and put on this charade that they're really nice people, but when everyone is gone they go back to being monsters. They make my little sister cry all the time and they treat her like an actual slave. 

 My aunt that lives with me always treats me like shit and says that I should shut the fuck up and stop telling people that they are horrible people. But it's true!

 Everyone in this house is a fucking horrible person and they mentally fuck with me and I genuinely feel like it's a Stockholm syndrome kind of thing because I feel like I love them when they act nice to me but then they immediately treat me like shit. They are genuinely evil and they remind of demons or snakes.

 I just want to get out of here but there is literally no way for me to leave until I'm 18 and that's 2 years away. I don't think I can wait that long anymore. Everything seems like it's getting darker and I'm being suffocated by the darkness and everyday the light gets further away. It's making me go closer and closer to finally committing suicide. I can't take this mental anguish anymore.",0

509,"So I've had depression and anxiety for a pretty long time, at least the last 10 years (I'm a 21y/o guy) and I've had a lot of medical problems (heart procedure, migraines) that have only made them worse. The awesome thing is that I managed to fight through it all for the past three years and get back to a great college that I really love being at. But now, well, shit has gone downhill pretty fast.

Before Spring Break I was fine, my depression was under control because I was so happy to be back at school and I was fighting my anxiety off decently well. I was barely keeping up with all my work. Going from being sick for three years to a full time student at a really difficult small college has been just brutal. I went home for Spring Break and I don't know what happened, but the second week I was home I felt my depression creeping in and because I'm stubborn, I ignored it. Now I'm at school, extremely depressed, like unable to get out of bed until 5pm and I can barely sit in front of my computer.

Here's the draw back. I'm a musician and I (poorly) do stand up comedy. What does this have to do with my mental health? Well, here's the thing: I am without a doubt my most creative when I am at my lowest points in my mental health. So I don't like medicine because it makes me uncreative which I hate feeling.

I guess I'm just wondering what you guys think I should do to stop this from progressing. I feel pretty helpless and since I haven't been able to do any work, I feel worthless. Do any of you deal with this type of stuff? How do you cope and manage slumps like this? Should I try to do anything or should I just ride it out and deal with the problems once I'm better?",0

My family didnt notice anything at all, i usually try to pretend that nothing happened and im good. Everything i say or write im feeling guilty about it. All these things are so stressful for me.
Sometimes im writing with a female friend, but she has someone and again i feel very fucking guilty about my messages to her. I always apologize to her for what i wrote and she says that its fine but i dont think its true.
Im thinking about suicide for past week or two, but im not sure i can do that and im scared of dying. I dont want to live like that. Most of the time i feel so lonely and i never know if im gonna feel happy or sad, it changes so fast.
Few months ago i didnt think i could change that much. Earlier i was so wholesome, i almost never felt sad or lonely. Often i cant sleep, or i wake up in the middle of night. I dont know, im retarded and im sorry.
Please tell me if i made it all up and its not true.

Yes, I know what helps- sunlight, sticking to a schedule, therapy, exercise, etc. But when my depression is bad, just taking a shower feels impossible. 

These people are well educated in the psych arena- social worker, addiction specialist, etc. but have never recognized that depression is not the same for everyone- and sometimes not  the same for me from one week to the next.

And I’m not a complainer at all. I pull back from everyone when it is particularly bad and then blamed for not staying in touch. It takes so much energy just to appear that I function normally.

I'm 16 years old, student , struggling with depression and anxiety

**Backstory:** 5 years ago, I was happy with my life and everything was awesome. I was quiet good in school, had lots of friends, was very good at soccer(pretty big in germany) and had a good relationship with my parents. I just always was a charismatic guy who everybody liked to hang around with.

But somewhere along the line, I changed.

I dont know when this happened or why, I didn't lose anyone close or got into an accident. There was nothing where you would think, yea thats the reason he changed. Nothing.

&amp;#x200B;

**My story, my life, my failure: I dont know where to start**

Around the time I turned 15, I stopped going to school, I just didn't feel like it. It's not because I didn't like school or I was harassed by others, no everything was normal. But I just didn't have the motivation. Then it started

I found a way to persuade my parents that I was sick very often, I just said I had headaches and was struggling to stand up and stuff, basically nothing you can prove by test or the doctor tell that I'm lying. So here I am, lying to my parents about having some sort of very bad headaches and staying at home maybe 2 days a week. Because my parents both worked at that time, I was home alone and used my time mostly for Netflix or YT. 

Of course, school became harder. I nearly had to re-take the class because my grade weren't good enough, but in the end I did it, but close. Saying to myself, I am not going to continue this shit this school year, I went into this year super motivated. But after 2 weeks maybe, I started again. And it got worse, month by month. My parents, especially my mom did everything to help me, made so many calls and appointments and read books and just tried to help me. But I wasn't sick, so nothing worked which drives her crazy. Like literally, she is so helpless and sad that nothing works. And here I am pretending...

&amp;#x200B;

March 2018 I met my girlfriend. Literally the best person on this planet. I love her. We are in a happy relationship and I really think shes the one. But of course she got involved in all of this too. At first she thought nothing of it and always felt bad for me when I said I wasn't feeling good. But now, after a year of beeing together, she is kinda pissed everytime, because she is somebody that will go to school, regardless of how they feel, and I'm the oposite. 

&amp;#x200B;

I've just made so many mistakes within this one year and I just can't stop making them. I just can't help it. 

So two weeks ago, I got my diagonsis for Depression and some form of social anxiety.

Everything has changed for me that night.

In those two weeks I got to school twice. I don't really talk to my friends anymore, and everybody tells me I've changed. Like do know how hard it is when your parents literally ask you why you are so cold and just not fun anymore and that they want their son back!?

I dont eat anymore, I sleep 12 hours a day, I think about cutting or even suicide.

&amp;#x200B;

In one year I turned my good life into shit. I'm at rock bottom. I don't know what to do or where to start. I dont have the power to get up in the morning. I've let my parents, my girl and myself down and I will never forgive me for this. I could talk about my miserable life more but thats the biggest thing I had to get of my chest. 

Maybe I'll post more details soon. Idk

I have been taking a medication to help fight depression, I want you to know that it works really well, but recently, everything has been going down hill faster and faster and It doesn’t feel like it will slow down any time soon.
I need a place to get my thoughts out. 

I feel like I cannot talk to anyone, I feel stupid, anxious, tired as fuck and can’t keep up. I feel done. 

My wife asked me to open up about it last night and I don’t know how to, I don’t know how to tell her I feel like walking out of work, I feel like the struggle with trying to have a kid is getting too expensive, I feel like I can’t breath I feel like I can’t express any of this through physical words.

I know that in the end, everything will be fine, it always is, it literally always gets better but there are rare times like right now, where it doesn’t feel like it’s fine or it’s going to be “ok”.

519,"Quick context: I'm 20 and I've been depressed since highschool. 2 years sgo I attempted suicide and was put on a mental hospital for a while, I was released a few months later and I've been getting help since, I'm on a lot of medication. 

Ever since I graduated from high school I've felt lost, because there was nothing that I wanted to do, and stepping out of my comfort zone(sleep and videogames, basically) took a tremendous amount of effort. I've felt pressured by society, parents and ultimately myself, to do something that I didn't really want to do: wotk or study. Last year I worked for like 4 months till I could no longer bear it and quit. A few months later I started college, which I'm now still going, however as time goes on the harder it becomes. When I feel bad and I don't wanna go to class, I'm conflicted as if it's just a normal feeling (people wanna skip work/school all the time) or if I'm being influenced by my illness. Should I force myself like ""a normal person would""? Is me blaming it on depression  just looking for excuses to be lazy? Most of the time I don't know how much I can say things are because of my depression or because of my defects that I can't accept I have. Ultimately, whatever the reason, I just don't wanna go. I want to stay in my comfort zone. I don't want to be bothered or face challenges. Can I really go through life like this excusing it on depression?",0
520,"I’ve been losing my friends and can see them actively drifting away from me.

There’s no other group of people I can be friends with without facing ridicule and I care too much about that to just ignore it (so don’t say to just “not care about them”). These have been the closest friends I’ve ever had but now I don’t know what to do. 

I’m sorry if I offend anyone by being a self diagnosed depressive teen but I can’t help it.

My parents are strict, traditional asian parents and criticized me every waking moment for working at that dealership and being a complete failure and disappointment to my family so then I quit and bought a one way ticket to Hawaii and lived with a guy that I had connected with over a dating app. I was at my wits end and already felt like I had hit rock bottom anyway. I ended up staying in Hawaii for 6 months and during this time I aggressively looked for jobs but soon realized the job market there is awful and you certainly need to be well connected in order to find a decent salaried job. That didn't work so I moved back home and lived with a friend for a few months. I worked at a biergarten for free for 5 months before landing a job in DC at an advertising agency. I grinned, worked my a\*\* off and ended up finding a place to live in the city, all was good for a short while for ONCE in my life but then I was ""let go"" from my job after 11 months due to the company ""restructuring"" which I call bullshit but there I was given my severance and now I'm unemployed.

I was scrolling through my LinkedIn just now and saw that my ex boyfriend is now in his country's Forbes 30 under 30 and I just want to shrivel up here and hang myself. After him and I parted ways, he went back to his country and got a job at this small start up but due to their limited capital, they offered him a CEO role and part ownership. Now they have over 1500 clients. This destroyed my entrepreneurial spirit completely and witnessing his success forces me to reflect on myself and what I've reduced myself to. My friends would describe me as someone who would ""always persevere"" but I'm no longer that person anymore. I am lower than dirt, my family doesn't acknowledge me anymore and I'm crumbling in debt – I cannot do this anymore. My friend out in LA is offering to fly me out there but I just don't know anymore. I don't even want human contact at this point. I'm too ashamed at myself for being so broke while all of my friends are making over six figures and going on vacations. I've always worked hard and have been independent since I was young. Interpreting my parents taxes, skipping playdates to help with house chores and assisting with other family matters. My grades weren't stellar throughout my childhood due to verbal and physical abusive parents. I had a hard time investing myself in eduction when I was in fear of my life everyday. After CPS got involved the physical abuse stopped but not verbal. I went to therapy all throughout my adolescent years and then eventually went off to college but my mental health issues were still prominent and it still is today. I have no idea what I should do with my life right now. I am contemplating on hanging myself because I cannot stand the person that I am today and the debt that I am in.",0

So you stay up as late as you can, feeling like shit and full of gross self pity probably trying to distract yourself with something that’s a waste of time anyways before succumbing to exhausting - only to start it all over again.

525,"I’ll preface by saying my depression is rooted in relationships. When I was 13 a formal dance was a round the corner. Leading up to the dance people in class were going over who they were going to the dance with. I didn’t have one so I sat silently and didn’t say anything. 

Unfortunately for me though, a former close friend of mine though became a “popular” kid that year, while I was the one that became bullied in the class. The former friend knew I didn’t have a date, but proceeded to ask EVERY girl in the classroom if they wanted to go to the dance with me. And the responses either ranged from “no” to “ew. God no”. After every girl was done having their moment, the friends proceeded to tell me “CatheterCowb0y, you’ll be lucky if you can ever get a girl”...... 

There were a lot of moments that have made me feel down, but this moment in particular still plays in my head like a favorite movie that I’ve binged multiple times now. I’ve been trying so hard since that day to beat past this thought, but I’ve only been in one real relationship that I stayed in for too long, and since I broke up with the one girl, I’ve only been on one date in 6 months..... and last night a bottom came when I spent $450 on a girl that I didn’t even meet face-to-face. All she did was send photos before asking me to have her uncle access my Verizon account so she could have her “uncle” buy her an iPhone. Once she talked to me more about buying the phone I blocked her, so it’s good to no I have a sliver of self-esteem in me, but the fact I went this far for her I think is a sign I’m not in a good spot with my mental health. I haven’t seen my therapist to talk to about this yet so I feel like this would be a good place to vent/seek comfort right now because after yesterday, I’m at this point now where if I’m 30 (I’m 25 now) and I’m still still single or not in a relationship I want to be in, I still live with my mom and dad in their house, and still don’t have a full-time job, I think the easier option will be to shut off the voices for good and hope there’s such thing as “past lives” because I’m getting sick of being in this one. 

It’s really getting harder and harder everyday to find the hope and positivity when it doesn’t feel like it’s happened yet or will happen at all.

So i left school a year ago and since then many things went downhill, i started to study and lost contact to many of my friends and Additionally after a few months i realized i dont want to study this anymore. Because of my lonelines here my depression and mild anxiety got worse.. Mainly because sarcasm and generally talking about my problems was a huge vent for me.. 
Generally speaking i can balance things out and if there's nothing major going wrong.. i can keep myself motivated and care for myself even with depression..
So far so good, after the semester i wanted to work and applied for a job and even got to the job interview everything went really well and they seemed so optimistic 
I was really happy and thought id easily get the Job..

But then a few weeks later (last week) i got the mail that i didnt get the job.. So now i have to sit a new full semester in a study i really hate and i can barely motivate myself. Additionally the Situation with my parents is always annoying (for many complicated reasons) and even today im pissed that i have to visit them at the weekend.. But thats not all, my girlfriend struggles often and i needed to be there for here a few days ago which costs me energy, but since two days she feels better.

I haven't really been happy with life for a long time.  I have plenty of reasons to be happy, but I just don't enjoy life 90% of the time.  The other 10% feels like I'm faking it.  It feels like whenever I AM happy, it's completely temporary and I'm just waiting for the next crash, like being depressed is my natural state.  And I hate that.

I'm terrified that I'm never going to be happy in life.  That this is permanent, I'm never really going to get better.

I don't even know if therapy helps.  It sure doesn't feel like it.  It doesn't feel like my antidepressants help either, but I can't tell if they're the wrong dose or if that's just how it is.  I'm not suicidal but sometimes I wish I was.

I just desperately want to know this isn't permanent.  That all of my strives to try and change things, try and get better aren't for nothing.  I want to be happy but I just...can't?  And I'm terrified this is how it's always going to be.

I've been a pretty regular pot smoker for a while but I haven't tripped on anything since my depression got really bad a few years ago, since I always heard taking those sorts of things in a bad state of mind would give you a bad trip. I have to say, the past few months have been some of the worst i can remember, but the mushrooms brought me back to the me I remember from years ago. I laughed, I cried, I felt more in touch with myself than I have in so long. The next day, things were more or less back to how they've been so I'm not saying this is a miracle cure even a little bit, but I'm curious if anyone else has had similar experiences. The trip let me remember what being my old full self felt like, and even though I'm not back to that yet just a glimpse of how beautiful life can be is a HUGE deal.

I got a wild hair to go on a date - with myself - tonight. Weird. I have never thought that way. So I bought a nice salmon, some Sangria, bunch of fresh veggies and fruit - no crap food that only makes me feel worse, and I decided I’d go home (I live alone) and light a single candle while I cook in honor of me. One celebratory candle to signify I’m still here. I still have value. I’m still loved and lovable. I may be old, fatter, more wrinkles than before...depression has robbed me of much, much too fast, but fuck it. I have unexplored and under-developed gifts, talents, ideas - so tonight I’m going to celebrate me. The one and only me there is, no matter who else approves or disapproves, desires me or doesn’t, thinks about me or doesn’t. Because in this brief moment, I can see the miracle that is me.

560," I moved to the UK in 2017 from Singapore. I had a lot of friends there and was probably what you would consider one of the ""popular"" people in school - always going out, lots of friends, parties, smart (I know I might sound snobby and cocky but I had all that back then). Now that I live here, I don't have any of that. I barely go out, I can count the number of friends I have here on one hand, I have never been invited to a party here and my grades have dropped so bad that I had to drop a year (grade for Americans). I've visited Singapore twice in two years, and both times I blew over £600 (800 USD) in less than two weeks because I was out every night with my friends, getting fucked up, going for dinner, travelling etc. Now that I can't go back, I always see my friends doing those things without me every week. It frustrates me so much to see them be happy without me because I know I can't be with them. It's not just that they go out without me, it's also that they never make time to talk to me because they are so preoccupied. Weekends have been so lonely for me because there is nothing for me to look forward to, not even conversation. I don't value my friends here at all like I do with people back in Singapore. This girl told me a secret that she hooked up with a guy in school who had a girlfriend and when I asked her why she would tell me that, she replied with ,""because I really needed to tell someone and you don't have any friends so I'm not risking anything by letting you know"". This made me feel so shit because it was true. I'm just some stress ball for her. I can't tell my friends in Singapore that, they haven't made time for me. I can't tell my mum, she lives in Japan ( nine hours ahead so time difference makes it difficult to talk) and I can't tell my dad. My dad is a weird guy, he is the reason we had to move to the UK against every hope that I had. My mum was in tears when she found out we had to move to London and so was I. I guess it isn't that bad for her, she lives in Tokyo with her family so she has friends and stuff to do. I just realised that I have less friends than my mum or my dad. Anyway, since moving here, my dad drinks everyday. One day, he started drinking at 8:30 am after having an argument over the phone with my mum because of his drinking habits. In an effort to secretly drink that day, he put his wine in his coffee mug. Shit place to hide such a smelly drink. The day before, he had come into my school drunk and picked me up in his car. The humiliation is unlike anything I have ever felt before. I had two choices: stay home the next day and hide from the embarrassment or go to school to avoid my dad. I chose the second option. He has embarrassed me on several occasions: turning up to my football match drunk and shouting from the sidelines, initiating a massive argument with me in front of my friends, driving me home drunk, calling me in the middle of class and getting angry when I don't answer, calling out my teacher in front of me and my friends, taking the piss out of the fact that my school recommended me to a therapist... the list goes on. He did all of this while drunk. Finally, karma got to him and he fell down from the top of the stairs, shattering his arm (the doctor said it looked like a crushed packet of crisps) and stopped breathing twice in 10 minutes. I thought this was an enlightening moment for him and he would finally recover. Nope. that was over a year ago. If I was at school that day, he wouldn't have gone to hospital. A part of me wish I went to school. A couple of months ago, my mum finally came to London but only for a short while. My parents got into a massive argument again but it was much worse this time. My dad started accusing my mum of slashing his leg with a knife (obvious bullshit because there is no scar) and then threatened us with suicide. Imagine your own dad saying that he was going to kill himself if we didn't side with him. My mum wants to seperate, I want them to divorce and I want to move out. But I can't do any of that for at least a year and a half. I'm lost. I don't know what to do. All this time, my friends are just going out, having fun and doing whatever they want. They are even going on holiday to Thailand all together, except for me because I'm still in school. I hate seeing them have fun now. Nobody has to reply, I just needed somewhere to vent. Trying to see if talking or writing down how I feel helps at all. I've tried councillors but they don't help at all. They just somehow managed to make the conversation about themselves and change the subject. I do MMA to try and relieve some stress but that only works if I do well. I've fallen out of love with football because its just so shit in England. I don't have any real friends to talk to here so I can't do that. I've tried to run for executive positions within the school but that didn't work. Oh well, what can you do, hey?

However...My current job is not going to hot (hence looking for a new one) and I kind of went off last night via Skype on how I hate my current company, to a manager of said company. She said she won’t share it but who knows...

I’ve been trying to love more; I find that loving anybody is difficult when this disease is in your brain.

Contempt for myself is the most debilitating. “How dare you not prepare for your project better than everybody else, how dare you not get your homework done, how dare you fail that class.” I’m not saying that depression should be an excuse to fail a class, but the result of failing on depression is similar to an infection of an open wound. It’s much more painful, lasts much longer, and is potentially fatal. But with all that contempt I feel, why should I want a better life? Well I don’t. But why? I don’t deserve it, I’m a horrible human being. I’ve lied, cheated people, cheated on people, done drugs to avoid work. Who am I to deserve a content life? There isn’t a damn thing I do that I feel content about. Well, where do you want to live? Where do you want to vacation to? These questions aren’t to be ignored. One has to realize that potential exists in us all, and that we’re not all lost causes, if we all were then we wouldn’t want anything meaningful. We wouldn’t think about anything in the future. We wouldn’t think about how sometimes it feels really good to help people through their hard times, or how good it feels to catch that football and realize you’ve made it to the end zone and everyone is screaming your name, or how great it feels to stand up after a concert and show to the world how proud you are of what you’ve performed. I say to you, whoever reads this, to try to think about the meaningful things to you, and don’t just ignore them and consider them to be random flukes.

Life isn’t going to all the sudden be like what we see in movies, but you’ll start to cherish more and more when things do make you happy.

I am currently in the process of creating a new measure of rumination which have been found to have a strong correlation with depression.

When I was in 7th grade I was diagnosed with depression, I got put on medication, and it worked. After I got my depression under control my anxiety decided to step in and take its place. I got put on medication for that and it helped me out for a couple months. Then came 8th grade. 

I was having trouble with my school, so I decided to do online school that year, which wasn’t the best option as I had barely any people in my life (I have a small family and only a couple friends), so I became very isolated. I knew I was supposed to do more than just be on meds but I wasn’t presented with many opportunities to do things. I didn’t like sports and my parents and I had no idea how to find things for me to do/join. I honestly have no idea how I survived those 6 months. 

Then comes this year, I’m 15 and a HUGE mess. For most of the first semester I stayed home because my anxiety and depression were running wild, and I had no idea what to do because if I went to school I’d have panic attacks, but if I stayed home I’d be stressing out that I’m missing. I’d been trying counseling but all of the counselors were really presumptuous, and I had no idea what clubs my school had so I continued to be isolated. I somehow managed to pass all my classes (barely) but still felt like garbage. 

Here’s where things hit the fan. So, during my 3 month depressive episode I managed to mess up the one thing I was good at, which was making sure I took my medication. My mom and I had realized that I still had pills left over from November, so I was completely out of wack. Then in February I got diagnosed with ADHD, which is just great. My friends and I never have actual conversations, my parents and brother are the only people I talk to, and I’m still trying to find a counselor, but at least I’m going to school more than I used to. I still haven’t made any friends yet, and I understand that it’s because I haven’t been very present at school. It just hurts. The worst part is that my parents are the most supportive people in the world and it pains them that they don’t know how to help me, which in turn makes me sad that they’re sad. I don’t know what to do and I’m feeling pretty defeated but my gut is telling me it will get better.

579,"Posting on a throwaway account as to not worry anyone I know here on Reddit.

I moved from Florida to Texas a year and a half ago because my baby mama moved here with our son and I thought it'd be a good idea to start fresh and try and be a better father after me not falling out of bad habits the first few months of my son's life...I was an alcoholic cokehead, and was still in a self destructive party mentality fueled by depression I've been diagnosed with since high school, and totally neglectful of my son's and ex's needs.

They moved to Texas, and I followed. I've been clean since, have a full time job and an apartment. I'm around my ex and our son pretty much every day, and our co-parenting is going extremely well.

I love being around my son more than anything, but when I'm home at the end of the day, alone, everything hits me.
All my family and friends are in Florida. I talk to most of my friends from time to time, and I always see their posts on IG and Facebook. I'm still hear the gossip from everyone, like one of my best friends being with an old ex of mine, asking if it bugs me. I tell them no, I'm a dad now, I have a new life, but I let it get to me... it's extremely dumb. I used to be in a band, but broke up because of the move, and I still hear from people expressing disappointment and reminding me of past house shows and parties and all that jazz...I would delete all my social media, but honestly it's the only social interaction I get, whether it's just gossip, or friends who have been genuine to me and actually care to update me on their lives.

I have no friends here, all I do is work and be with my son. I have a few hours to myself at home before sleep. And when I do go out, I meet people and follow up, try and strike a friendship, but I never have time to arrange a time to meet because of work and dad life. So eventually that peters out. I'm extremely lonely and my depression has never been more hard hitting than this, now that I don't really numb myself anymore through substance abuse. 

I'm at a loss, any advice is appreciated. Thank you ",0
580,"Hello all,

It is my first time posting here. Made a new account for it. I started a new job at the end of Jan of this year. I have been struggling with mental health issues (depression and anxiety) off and on my whole life, but recently it has become unbearable. I stopped going to work a few days ago because I couldn't get out of bed so I figured I was fired. One of my managers messaged me a few days later and asked if I was coming in. I mentioned that I was having a rough time and wanted to know how to contact HR because I wanted to inquire about a personal leave. 

She gave me the info and I called, they asked a few questions, and I should expect a call today in regards to it. They told me because I have not been at my job for one year I was not eligible for the typical leave, but possibly for short term disability. Has anyone been through this before? I have never struggled with it this bad, am 32 now, and previously held down a job for 11 years.

I'm not sure if I should quit or try to take the short term leave if offered. I feel guilty for letting my team down because me calling out left them short handed and worried about them asking me questions upon my return, if it happens. Any advice is kindly appreciated.",0

I'm here just sitting, i didn't go to uni today to get this shit done but i feel so unmotivated, it's literally the last thing i want to do. An year ago i would be doing it gladly, bc it seems to be a big deal 

Not only that but my boss is giving me calls about my productivity, i don't get stuff done like used to. And then i realized this job fucking sucks... I'm 24/5 locked im my room doing shit for a company that don't really pays me that well. The upsides is that i have a flexible schedule, dont really have to deal with people, and the company is growing big so it might be good to stick around and get to be a senior 

If quit i would quit after receiving my paycheck, the thing is i don't have any backup job, so i will probably just stick around my parents house for a while, but i don't know if being there will do good for my mental health 

I really don't know if i feel like this about my job bc im depressed, or i am depressed and feeling like this is just a consequence

I’m tired of being mad at the world. I just want to sit down, hug someone and have them tell me it’ll be alright, even if alright isn’t forever.

584,"  In my life it always seems to be misery especially in my dating life. My life has always been emotionless and bland up till I met four people, one of which me and her mutually adopted as brother and sister, two became my best friends, and the last she became the woman i love more than anything and we seemed so happy together. We were always smiling having a good time and telling each other we loved one another every time we looked at one another.  
    
  My mind doesn't work like most people's i can only romantically look at one person at a time, until the give me a definite answer of when they want the relationship to end. So in my dating life something always happens that never fails to occur. No matter how happy we are, how much we talk or tell each other how we feel. They always disappear no explanation no warning, all i get is they always tell me that we are still dating, or in the process of making a relationship if we hadn't started already.  
    
  To be honest I can end a relationship my mind will not let me, and with my current girl I'd rather die than truly lose her. But with the last girl i was with, or trying to date she always told me she wanted to start a relationship but she wouldn't let it start, nor give a definite answer. Just silence for three months other than her telling me she still wanted it, but wouldn't let it start. This silence has happened in every attempt at a relationship, as well as in ever relationship i have had they always tell me we are still together that they love me, or that they still want to have a relationship but won't let us start one.  


  It ruins me. Countless days i spend tearing my mind apart then trying to piece it back together again. It is so painful that i often result to physical pain to dampen the emotional. The woman I am with now the one from the first paragraph i love her more than anything, with every fiber of my being. To lose her would mean I have nothing and no more reason to go on in this life. She's my everything and i can't lose that, today is our anniversary i don't know if will see her or not. The pain is getting to me more, and more I'm not sure how much more i can take before I do something stupid to try and drown it out. some people say no one is worth your own life, but to me she is worth my life, and so much more.

596,"I hate group therapy. I just don’t feel depressed in my day to day life now that meds have begun working. But the group therapist always insist I must be hiding my depression or problems with my smile, like a mask. Why can’t I just be happy that I have a good day? That I’m not controlled by anxiety and depression anymore. 

Sometimes they literally dim the lights and close the blinds. I hate being in the dark, awkwardly trying to relate. It makes me feel depressed being in an environment where everyone’s talking about how miserable their day is. But I cant relate anymore. I get to classes on time, I eat in the dining hall alone. I aced an exam. I just have more wins than losses. 

But it’s school mandated and I’m gonna get in trouble today because I’ve been ditching repeatedly. And they might kick me out of college I guess. To be fair, I was planning to drop out after this semester, just because I paid tuition and my grades are good. It’s just such a shitty situation. Mandated therapy just adds another level of stress to the equation. 

I miss my old therapist. Where we can just talk about the great parts of my day. I hate constantly being reminded that I’m taking pills for mental illness. I took a leave of absence last semester and I’m quitting after this semester but that’s okay. But I hate how that’s being treated as such a failure when I know it’s not. (“Aren’t you upset about the leave? It should be normal to be upset with yourself.”) But constantly being told that I’m failing even though I feel like I’m winning is chipping at my mental health. It’s making me doubt myself. 

I’m so stressed about the meeting today I’m anxious that I might relapse. But realistically, I know whatever happens I can handle. I just wish I could get more support from people around me for this. I know I’m doing tons better, I’m rarely sad or anxious. But my boyfriend and my family gets extremely stressed when I rant about stuff like this because they think I’m all better. 

But honestly, who wouldn’t be anxious about possibly getting kicked from school? Though tbh, I’m more stressed about being forced into the shitty group therapy than being kicked out. I actually think it’s undoing so much of the progress and self confidence I’ve been working on. I’d rather get kicked out then be forced to ruin my mental health. ",0

605,"I'm not sure if this is odd, but this actually isn't for me. This is about my boyfriend. I posted this problem originally under r/relationships and was told my problem may be better answered here.

Basics first. I am a 26F and my boyfriend is a 31M. We've been together for 6 years now, and boy what a 6 years it has been. We've accomplished a lot. We dealt with his psycho ex, which I know everyone calls their s/o's ex 'psycho', but you will have to take my word on this one. She has literally dropped his kids off to us in the middle of the night, high as a kite and said she didn't want to be a mom anymore. 4 months later she decided she wanted to be a mom again. Mind blowing...but like I was saying. We dealt with her, made it through a 2 year custody battle and obtained full custody of both his boys, bought a house together, new cars, had a baby, I graduated college and have my dream job. There's a ton to be happy about. Problem is, he isn't happy.

I like to think I'm reasonably attractive, funny and overall an understanding girlfriend. We don't really fight, I could probably count on one hand the number of times we had a serious fight. None of which escalated beyond a heated discussion and make up sex. The kids are great, very well loved and happy. Our baby is doing amazing, very healthy. 

So why is he angry all the time? The past year, any time the kids or I attempt to talk with him about anything he is always angry or upset. I've tried talking to him about this and his response is, ""I don't know what's wrong with me. There's tons to be happy about, but I'm not happy."" And that breaks my heart. 

We haven't been on a date in almost 2 years, I honestly can't remember the last time he complimented me and the only time I feel connected to him is during sex now. Which has now resulted in my unhealthy need to have sex constantly because I love him so much and want to feel connected anyway possible. But now the sex makes me sad. It isn't like it use to be. I've tried spicing it up, sending dirty pictures and flirting more to get him excited. I just don't think I'm enough anymore. UPDATE: I actually convinced him to go on a date with me last Sunday. I posted about this as well. Let's just say, it didn't go well.)

All I know is I feel devastated that he feels this way. I want him happy, even if it isn't with me. He swears I'm not the problem. Which I don't know if I believe...but either way I just want this resolved so he can either be happy or I can have closure and move on.

Any thoughts on what is going on with him? I'm happy to answer more questions if it helps. I was told on my original post that he may have depression or a mental illness. Which I've also felt, so I have suggested he see a therapist. His response is that seeing a therapist isn't something he would be open to. I definitely don't want to force him. Any advice at all is much appreciated.

611,"A little bit of backstory: I've always thought like I'm someone special, someone that can change the world, ever since I was in about third to fourth grade, and I was always outgoing, extroverted, empathetic, and fun to be with. I've made deep and genuine relationships with other people because of that. I've always thought differently from other people, excelling in my academics even though I don't study at all. Right now I'm in my 4th year at college, and I'm failing at least half of my subjects. I've become lazier, and find it hard to learn new things. I've been an atheist all my life since my first year of high school.

I've always thought of things differently, and considering both rational and emotional perspectives when making a decision. As I grew older, I realized more and more things about the world and the universe. I realized that we are very, very, very meaningless. Because of that, I find it hard to have the sense of urgency in the important aspects of my life (like graduating and having a job soon). Just last year I decided to check with a local psychiatrist and was diagnosed with anxiety disorder and depression. I was prescribed some medicine to help me sleep but after one month, I decided to quit taking it completely because I couldn't afford them anymore. Between that and today, my closest friends help me get through every day of my life and made myself dependent on them but recently I've become more and more ""self-destructive "" to the point where I cut my wrists, punch walls, and hit my head to just think of the pain and pleasure and ignore the things that I've been thinking.

I've been finding ways to change the way I think but so far, I have no idea how. I also realized that depending on other people is not healthy since they also have their own lives to think about. Right now I'm a bit drunk and alone, and no changes has happened since my realizations. It's just so fucking hard to realize these things but have no idea how to change them. I think I need help from other people who went through or who have been going through this that's why I decided to post here.",0

616,"I'm sorry for the novel. I have a lot of pets (I don't like that word but I don't want to be pedantic so I'll use it here) so bear with me as I describe their living situation.

Over the years I've been getting worse and worse with depression. When I was young and healthy we got 2 cats. They're outdoor cats (I didn't know better when we got them and I struggle to make them indoor cats now) and they're both spayed. Not up to date on worming I just remembered I need to make a vets appointment! God I need to put this stuff in a calendar.

At 16 when I recovered from depression (or so I thought) we got a dog with the idea she would help me be more active. I love her to pieces but I know if a couple thousand vet bill comes in for one reason or another, we wouldn't be able to pay it. I live with my parents and the dog is more theirs than mine because she spent more time downstairs where they are. She's not allowed upstairs alone because the stairs are too slippery and she's not careful on them. The first few months were great I walked her daily and taught her things and we went on morning runs with the sunrise. Then I relapsed and now she's only taken out every few days or even weeks sometimes. She's so damn happy but I know she should have a better owner. I'm trying to take her out more often to tire her out with fetch, tug of war and commands and to let her explore and meet pooches.

We also have parrots as they are my favourite animal. 3 cockatiels, a conure, and my biggest is an alexandrine (the size of a pidgeon). I have them in 3 separate cages which I got online as I couldn't find one big enough in a pet store. I found an even bigger one (62"" by 24"" by 37"" from what I remember) and I plan to get it and put the four smaller birds together as they really get along. All 5 get along really well so I thought to maybe even put them all together. The local parrot zoo has an aviary with these types of birds together so I trust them and think it'd be safe. 3 get let out around my room daily. Two of the tiels don't get let out as often as they're not yet trained to go back on their own like the others are. One white tiel had to be in a tiny travel cage for a week because she hurt her wing and wasn't allowed to fly and had to be given meds twice a day. She's okay now! But was really sad to not be together with her best friends.

My biggest problems are hygiene and vet checkups. I don't do yearly/ 6 monthly checkups like I learnt I should. I forget to worm the cats and dog (money isn't the problem, it's £18 for all 3 for 3 months). In terms of hygiene I don't think I take the time to clean the cages nearly well enough as I should. Mostly because I don't have the physical energy. Every time I look at the bottle of bird safe cleaner I feel guilty. I change out their litter tray regularly as it's easy to do but their perches and toys are a few weeks overdue for a good scrub in the tub. I don't cut them up fresh fruit/ veggies nearly enough either. I bought them some quality brand feed which has some dried fruits and veggies but that's not nearly enough for a proper healthy birdie. They won't eat unless the fruits and veg are finely chopped and that's what made me so lazy.

As you can tell I wrote the most about the parrots because I'm the one who takes care of them 100% of the time. The cats and dog are mostly my parents. They love them to bits especially our pooch. They have a rabbit too that's in an outdoor pen in our garden.

Even with all these animals I'm still tempted to get more and spend a lot of my time researching care for reptiles and fish. I won't get them because I know it's irresponsible. But I hate myself for wanting more.",0

618,"This is a really long one and I'm not the best writer so bear with me.


Backstory: in 2017 my depression started and it started bad. I moved away from my girlfriend and happiness 2 years ago on April 1, that summer was so, so lonely, I had no one and I did know what to do with my time. I stayed inside all day, lost my tan I had been rocking for years before that, read a lot of books and watched a lot of shows to fill the growing void in my stomach. In the 3 months of summer I only saw my girlfriend twice.


So when school started in September I wasn't the most exited since I didn't know anyone and being previously picked on and bullied (not bad just mostly isolation) I didn't know how people were going to react to the awkward new kid. When I arrived there was one other new guy and we became friends, I would like to take a moment to thank the living shit out of him, he kept me sane even though it was only for a short amount of time. 


The first few weeks were pleasant, there was no teacher yet so I was moving from class to class. Then came the next class, Ms. Wilson and she was amazing but went on maturity leave so that didn't last long and back to subs we were but this is where they come in. Mrs Fonceca then came in, Important later. 


Mitchel and Johnathan, two boys in my class who suddenly started talking to me. We met when I tried to play 4square with the girls in my class and they all yelled at me to go away, Johnathan comforted me and introduced me to Mitchel. Johnathan instantly flirted with me and I obviously wasn't interested so he backed off for a bit. Take note that both of them are shorter than be and a bit rounder in size, important later. Mitchel was friendly and generally a good guy at first. Friend and I were happy that we found more friends haza!  


Then one day Johnathan suddenly asked me out, Friend and Mitchel were staring at me waiting for my answer and what could I have said? I was dating a girl! I was still in the closet. Sure I'm Bi but I thought of them only as friends and I will never cheat on the person who has kept me happy. I tried telling him no but I only got bombarded with ""Oh so your against fat guys? that's low"" ""Such a bitch to think of me like that"" ""why not? its not like anyone else likes you"". I said we can hang out after school but its not a date.


The next day I walked into school and I instantly get surrounded by people asking why I picked Johnathan or why Johnathan? I was confused and Johnathan seemed to be avoiding me so I didn't know what was going on. At gym when changing the girls asked why I was dating Johnathan and if I liked him. Ding ding ding that's whats going on. When I confronted Johnathan about this he told me this was because I wouldn't go out with him and its not that bad. 


Then the next fucking week he started spreading rumors that he was dating another girl, this poor girl didst even know his name. I told everyone the truth and only a set amount of people believed me until they asked the girl. Through all this Mitchel comforted me, but the moment everything was cleared and I could breath again Mitchel asked me out and I instantly said no, I tried terminating my friendship with Johnathan but Mitchel stopped me. 

Trigger warning: 

Mitchel then started rubbing his hands on my shoulders any time we hung out. Whenever I said anything about him or Johnathan they would say nasty things about me and make everyone believe I was a slut or a whore or manipulative. They would apologize after everything but then Mitchel got worse the more I rejected him.

He started touching my thigh.

every time he walked by my next he'd reach don and touch it, lunch time I had to avoid the shoulder rubs and I could never do anything. Tell the teacher! I told Fonceca about everything and she said she would talk to them but every time they would ask why I tell they did nothing wrong. She did nothing about it, the principal was new and to nice to punish them.  I even tried to get his sister involved but she didn't do jack shit. 

I came home crying many many times because of them.

My previous depression came back at me like a title wave of sadness laced with knifes of words they said and things they did and I was not prepared. I missed a lot of school because I got physically sick because of them. Any time I tried to do anything I would get yelled at and rumors would spread. All this pressure got to me and I started acting out, I was more angry towards my loved one and even sharpies the bathroom walls. Which I got caught for.


when my mom asked me why I did that I broke down and told her everything. We agreed to do something about it, she told my dad and hey started fighting to get m happy again. I fucking love them. At this point Johnathan had touched my but a few times and Mitchel was dangerously close to other areas. 


I asked my teacher why she kept putting me with Mitchel and Johnathan and she said its apart of protocol that when a student gets bullied you put the victim and the abuser together so they sort it out on their own. I asked her if most of my grade is participation, she said yes, I told her Ill take the C because I don't want to be sexually assaulted anymore. She choked on her gum. I did the same with the P.E teacher who didn't like me. 


I dropped out. I left. I couldn't stand it anymore and I joined into homeschooling. During that time I had cut twice and was close to death due to Depression and now Anxiety as well. even though I was now out of there I developed Insomnia because every night I would wake up to night terrors f that school. Never saw a therapist and to this day Depression Anxiety and Insomnia are daily aspects of my life even though Girlfriend and Parents helped me.

My problem? 

I saw Mitchel again. I told him to fuck off but he explained to me that he changed and the only reason he acted like that was because his parents were divorcing. I stood by my choice and told him to fuck off again, he called me a bitch and left.  I was being a bit of a bitch and he looked hurt. 

I don't regret telling him off but did I do the right thing?

He was going through shit and just needed to take it out, he got diagnose with a personality disorder as well so it's not fully his fault for doing that to him. 

Did I make a mistake by not forgiving him? ",0
619,"Hey guys. So I work 24 hours a week in a crappy low paid job, some months it literally pays less than I'd get if I were on  unemployment benefits but I never want to do that again. I've been so depressed lately and really lacking motivation. I can't bring myself to work more because I HATE my job, yet I need to find a way to bring in more income. Right now my cupboards and fridge are basically empty and I have pretty much no food until I get paid in 5 days. This happens EVERY month and I am sick of it, and it adds to my depression that I have barely any money all the time but at the same time I'm too tired and too depressed to do anything about it, I'm too anxious and depressed to get a job that means leaving the house. Any tips or anything anybody does from home for a little extra cash that isn't too draining? ",0
620,"Every day I have free from work or other responsibilities I just sleep. I wake up, fall back asleep, wake up again to eat, go back to sleep, then before I know it my partner is home from work and I have to pretend like I didn't have such an unproductive day in fear he will judge me.

I feel like when I sleep I am free from all anxiety and fear, it's an escape for me that has become very addictive. But it is also very damaging. I feel lethargic at work, I have a hard time facing small tasks (phone calls make me want to kill myself), and I get antsy when my partner brings it up. 

He sees it as me being lazy. It's not that, it's because I am so overwhelmed with emotional distress on a day-to-day basis that I feel sleep is the next best thing to being dead.

Has anyone had any experience with this? Can you recommend some way to break the cycle? I am starting to feel miserable that my free time is always slipping away from me.

Ugh. This is all just the worst.",0
621,"Hello, I’m still kind of new to posting. Over my Christmas break I came across the show “Mr. Robot” and watching it has been so therapeutic. At first I thought it was kind of corny, but as I watched and saw Elliott cry over being lonely but at the same time not wanting to interact with the people around him I felt such comfort. There’s other moments, such as him imagining he’s in a better place if he’s not in a good one at the moment and I find that so relatable. The show has really helped with my depression and made me felt less alone. Has this show or any other show with a character who struggles with mental illness made you feel similar?",0
622,"It's come this far now. My mom can not decide. When I eat little, she yells at me. When I eat much she yells at me. She just yelled at me and almost hurt me because I threw away a piece of sushi I didnt want to eat anymore.

So I've decided. She's going to pay for that. She's a psychopath and I know she doesn't care for me. If she can't decide how much I should eat? Then I'll starve myself. It's better than being yelled at all the time.

I know this is wrong. It is. But it makes me feel good. My depression got worse. I forgot to take my meds a lot in the last time and picked up self-harm again. I dont know what to do. I've been on autopilot since days, just going to school and coming home, hoping that today was one of those days that my mom goes away to her stupid concerts.

I dont know why I'm posting this. Maybe I want advice. Or someone to stop me. Mostly I want to talk and hear from similar experiences. The point through depression when you decided you were gonna stop something as essential as this. It's not that I want to die or be anorexic. That's not it. I just dont want her to judge me on eating. So I'm not gonna do it. She knows very well I'm depressed. She doesn't care. My friends dont care. The only person I have is my step father and even he is slowly frustrated.

This is a rant or something. Yeah. I'm giving up. Not in killing myself but in destroying myself. And hoping someone other than me suffers under it. My mom can see where she goes to when her oldest child ends up in the hospital. She probably wont care. But still.

624,"Well how could you possibly say youre depressed you ask? Well. The answer isnt a short one.  Ive never cut myself,  never been an angsty teen. Never looked at a bottle of pills or something and told myself I was going to end it . Ive never had a mental breakdown in front of others.  I have woman that I love. That i know is my true love.  Ive been poor most my life but have had loving parents. And Ive had many experiences. All those years I told myself I would be happy once I had this. Or that, or someone to share life with or once I got that job I want . (Unemployed currently)  . I have a pretty normal life for my age, early 20's . Good friends. And yet. I feel so fucking alone . Always. I have feelings inside of me that dont make sense to me. I cant talk to anyone because it wouldnt make sense at all objectively. Its almost as if its an inability to be happy. I WANT it so badly . Anyone else in my shoes I feel WOULD be happy.  So why arent I? It makes me angry. I feel like im gruel, a tasteless slop. I have all the nutrients I need but I just dont have any of the flavor. Like I was made without that special something that makes you appreciative . And then last year I felt like I was dying, rushed to the ER and it turned out I was having an anxiety/panic attack? Dont really know, doctor just said to talk to a friend or family member and told me to be on my way.  And when Im alone at times, randomly my heart will race.  I cry uncontrollably (i don't cry much at all) and I feel this what can only be called dread. Its this horrible feeling. Just a deep sadness and panic and I feel like I cant tell anyone even while having it . Because I know theyll just brush it off. Its not something theyve been exposed to. Im usually so composed.  And for them to see me like that for what would appear to them to be for absolutely NO reason. Because I wouldn't have an explanation. I don't have a good one anyway . Im sorry I ranted. I just feel really emotional.  For no fucking reason.  Sorry guys.  ",0
625,"I just listened to a track by suicideboys that wrecked my whole afternoon. I just need to vent and maybe share stories/grievances. 

The song got me thinking about my own dead friends and relatives. The two biggest impacts being my friend who killed herself in high school and my brother who died of cancer. My friend jumped into traffic two days before thanksgiving. She had just turned 18, just graduated high school in the spring, and she was just gone. My brother had been given 6 months so we had some time to prepare, but he was only 14. I woke up to my brother laying dead on the couch. Looking at his lifeless body was...a little traumatizing. I miss them both every day. I’m not depressed because they’re dead, but it doesn’t help me in my state of mind right now that I’m in. 

What do you do to cope when this stuff happens? I normally just cry till I can’t anymore, but it never really makes me feel better. Sometimes I just smoke cause it’s hard for me to be sad when I’m high. ",0

627,"I have a crush on a girl i know for about 6 months.

It happened to me about 2 weeks ago. Got in a program for 6 months in october and had a late interest on her.

What surprised me is that she didn't looked like my previous crushes. She always looks kinda tired, never or almost no make up but it's ok with her.

I feel like what got me the most was to see a 20-23 ish girl that had a maturity and calm that i found very rare with girls of today (comparing to other girls from the program).

Add this and that, i think it was a little dream of me that was being real and out of pretention.

But as my previous experiences and one of my current goal in life is not to get something going with the other party, i'm just feeling like a lone sailor smiling knowing the ocean and his boat too well for what's gonna happen.

To not add many details, monday might have been the last time i saw her but i'm gonna be careful on that point.

Since it's recent and i am now out of time because of the end of the program, that was an easy from the start. But it hurts a bit to know it in advance.

i’m not a very open person and it takes a lot for me to say what i feel and the moment i do i get fucking dismissed as just “being too sad” and that i just need to “cheer up”. no shit sherlock. and when i tried opening about my self harming they’re quick to dismiss it, not even taking into consideration how HARD it is for me. my mom went so far as getting angry at me because i “wasn’t thinking about her and how she would feel about my situation.” i tried opening up to my friends but they just told me to just sleep it off and it’ll be better in the morning and then proceeded to get annoyed when i tried saying that it isn’t that simple.

it’s just so sad and cold for your friends and family to totally shut out your cry for help. the people who you thought would love and support you would rather turn a blind eye on your suffering just so they can pretend everything’s fine. i’m not claiming to be some saint but i sure as hell would never do what they did to a person in need.

i’m just so angry and sad on how i was treated and i don’t know who’s more wrong - them being dismissive over my obvious cry for help, or me thinking i’d actually get some sort of support from them.",0

645,So first of all I highly recommend listening to this song it’s beautiful in its melancholy. I’ve been listening to this song on repeat for a while now and I feel like you guys and gals would understand why. It’s just the infatuation with yesterday that I think all people with depression have. I always thought of depression as a shitty rollercoaster. On the “ups” I feel like we look back and beg for a second chance at yesterday. A second chance to try and be productive. To try and inch closer to the dreams that feel as if they are slipping away. On the “down” section yesterday always feels like it was better compared to today and that there is more hope in the past than the future. I would give anything for more attempts at yesterday yet I still fear what lies before me in tomorrow. I know this a rant and going nowhere but I know y’all will understand ,0
646,"I recently watched a Ted talk by Andrew Solomon about depression. One of the things that caught my attention is the way he described it:
“You don’t think, in depression, that you’ve put on a grey veil and are seeing the world through a haze of a bad mood. You think that the veil has been taken away, the veil of happiness and that now you can see truly. We, however, think that we see the truth, but the truth lies”

When I listened to his words the first time, something clicked inside me. I realized that I finally have a description and name for what I've felt for so long. Depression isn’t a dark filter that blocks happiness and only shows sadness. The truth is, it’s the absence of all veils, all filters. It is us seeing the unadulterated and raw truth of the world around us that leaves us in shock of our surroundings.

Depression is a tricky matter to handle and deal with. I’ve had a prejudice against those who claim to suffer from depression. It was hard to determine if they’re suffering from it or are simply having a hard day and feeling sad or upset. However, I’ve learned of the dangers of such prejudice. In the sea of depression, to sum everyone up and doubt them is to doom those who truly suffer. The spectrum of depression is tall and wide. Depression can manifest in the wealthy and poor and the social butterflies and the shut-in introverts.

If depression had a song, it would be of silence. It’s the quiet suffering crawling under one’s skin, draining away taste, smell, color and the will to live. One starts questioning: Is it worth waking up early, going to work? Is it worth brushing my teeth or, take a shower? Is it worth heating my food before eating it? Is it worth talking to a friend or family member to check on them? Is it worth sharing my suffering? Would anyone even understand or be able to identify with it? Is it worth investing time and effort into learning a new skill, pursuing a new hobby, discovering a hidden talent? Is it worth it to struggle in the world and achieve new feats when we’re all going to die anyway?

Is life worth living…?

Why is life worth living…?

Uncertainty and doubt possess one’s mind. The sounds of discouragement overpower all logic and reason. If depression was a mirror, it would reflect you as a small weak slimy creature that’s barely able to stand. It would show a broken smile and shifting eyes that avoid looking into anyone’s eyes. Every encounter is a new trigger for anxiety and horror. Every event creates an ultimatum: Will you face life and wallow in pain, or will you run away and drown in pity?

Is it worth proving oneself and improving when the odds are stacked against you?

Aren’t we all programmed to fail?

Engulfed by the soul-numbing void, one has no voice. Suffocated by the thick pain as it swallows and drowns the soul, one can feel no more.

You forget to smile, only reacting with one because the situation calls for it. Your emotional responses become diluted washed down versions of the genuine ones. You feel like an actor waiting for his queue to put on a reaction.

It always bothered me, how those who can truly bring true joy and happiness to others are often the ones who suffer the most. I thought at first that them identifying with and living through pain and suffering makes them able to heal it in others. But, why can’t they heal themselves? Where do they get the happiness that they lack and give it to others?

Trapped in one’s own mind space with a numb heart and a shattering soul, depression is the active process of a human withering.

I am not strong, I am not brave, I don’t know where I’m going or what I’m doing.

It’s the negative aura that originates from what I lack and am missing.

I have hit rock bottom, reached the bottom of the depths of the void. At that moment, after spending what seemed like an eternity, it hit me.

This is my strength, this is my fuel, this is my raw form. I can’t live in blissful ignorance. My eyes were exposed and were changed for good. My soul tasted the true form of life. I need to overcome this phase of being shocked.

If I can’t enjoy, then I will bring joy to others. If I can’t speak, I will listen to those who need me to listen. If I can’t see vivid colors, smell genuine scents, taste the depths of flavor then I will pour the residual traces and fumes into others to truly appreciate them.

What is it like to be depressed…?

It is to live.

647,"I do it all the time, sometimes I will get depressed and when I do I will destroy things I enjoy. Not physical things of course, I have no physical things aside from this computer as I have already given everything else away, I am talking about projects or accounts that I have poured hundreds of hours into online. 

At first it was my social media, as I scrolled through all the profiles of my ""friends"" (don't even know who half these people are) I had a moment of realization and anger that I was a social outcast, immediately I wiped the internet clean of any accounts or mention of me. It happened again with my video games, I spent thousands of hours and hundreds of dollars on my steam account but in another one of these 'moments' of anger and hate of my anti-social self I deleted everything and changed all my details, that account is now lost forever. So I bought myself another steam account, this time I only used it to develop mods for a the games I enjoyed. I would spend hundreds of hours on these massive projects, I would get halfway through a mod and realize it was pointless and delete it, the next day I would wake up and spend the next few months making another mod, rinse and repeat. 

Immediately before posting this I did it again, I worked a lot on a mod for one of my friends and I loved it but the thing is I took a break from it recently, so my friend found another person to completely re-make the mod for him. All my work was for nothing and I feel used, worst part is its probably my fault for putting off development for so long, once more I have deleted my steam, the money and all time I spent on it is gone again. I then removed all links I had with that friend and scrubbed that mod from the face of the Earth. It isn't the first time this has happened either, I had many disagreements with my friend over the mods development, I would delete him and remove the mod from the internet in moments of anger at how disrespectful and demanding he was at the free and time consuming work I was doing on the mod.

Now I feel pretty meaningless. I have no real friends, don't care much about finding any. No virtual friends either. No hobbies what so ever, I don't own a single video game anymore. There isn't a job in the world that gets me motivated. Since I left the military nearly a year ago my life was just jumping between Reddit and Youtube while I wait for my friend to come online so we can play with the mod. In a twisted way this could be a good thing, I will not lie that friend was a very broken person, much more broken than I could ever be. Maybe its for the best?

But now, as the old meme goes, ""Guess I'll die?"" ",0

652,"I don't know what to do with my life, and my mental health only makes it worse. I'm doing my first semester in college this year and it has been fuckin' awful: the environment sucks, I don't have any friends because no one seems to be interested in that shithole, and I'm sure that I don't want to work with the stuff I'm studying. I'm all alone in a big city, it's terrible. I don't want to do anything... why should I? I want to lock myself up in my room and just sit there all day looking at the ceiling. Meanwhile, my brain bombards me with things like ""Hah, you're just using this ""poor mental health"" bullshit so that you can have an excuse to slack off"". The other thing is feeling like e fuckin' leech, with my parents investing so much money in my life that I feel guilty: college, living expenses... it just makes this weight that I carry in my chest heavier and heavier. I struggle to distract myself in a daily basis, so that I don't fall on this mindset... but it's so goddamn hard. It all worsens up when I look into the mirror and I see the piece of shit that I am, both physically and mentally. I don't want to go out and make people look at my ugly face, it seems that everybody is looking at me and thinking ""wow what an ugly person jesus christ"", I know this is impossible, and I'm paranoid, but I can't help but feel that way. I shouldn't enter in my sexuality issues because they're all fucked up as well. With that many problems, I constantly think: ""What went wrong? How did I become such a broken person? Why can't I function like a normal person?"" It's so hard to find the answer.  
This weekend I went back to my hometown and during the trip these precious memories came back to me. My teenage years, with so many friends, nothing to worry about but getting good grades or texting someone you were interested in, all the happy moments I lived over there... I almost cried when I walked on those nostalgic streets back home, while listening to music. It was so beautiful. I miss those days... that's the only way I found for being in peace: looking back in my memories for times that I was truly happy.  ",0

655,"I do not really know how to begin a post like this, so I guess I'll just start writing every little fucked up thing that happened in my life, because I have no one to listen. I am a girl, and I am almost 16: if you think I'm young and have no idea of what I'm telling, go on, maybe it's true. You can tell me anything, insult me any fucking way, there's not a chance I haven't already been called like that.
I was born in a family with economical problems, they were almost broke when I came to life. My mum was 22, my dad was 23. We lived in a really small house with only one room and a bathroom. To get money, my dad went to another country to work and I used to see him only once a year for two days; then we bought a bigger flat not too far. I do not remember much about my childhood, I only know I used to spend all my days playing on my own in my small room, happy and innocent, I loved reading and read at least one book a day. At the age of seven, we moved to the country where my dad used to work, which I prefer not to mention. Things were quite normal, until I became an early teen, at the age of eleven/twelve. That's pretty much when shit started happening. For some unknown reasons, my parents started to abuse me both phisically and verbally for pretty random reasons. They only cared about what their friends thought about them, about their car, their home, their clothes, so they did everything possible to make a good impression. That fucking impression was more important than me, they didn't give a fuck, they just wanted me to become a fucking trophy to show off: you know, the perfect daughter. Fact is, I wasn't perfect at all. I was insecure about my looks and my body, about my abilities, there were many prettier and funnier girls and I was pretty much invisible. They would punish me if I got any bad marks (B was considered a bad mark too), but not only that. My mother let me was myself only twice a week, even if I did sports (sports that they had chosen). Then, here comes something that I personally find so stupid, so unworthy of everything but which was, apparently, a big deal: I pretty much do not feel cold, I sweat a lot and get really hot just by walking. It was march, and I was suffering a lot all that heat, so I just put on a normal t-shirt and jeans. My mum started swearing at me, calling me a worthless whore (12 years old), that I wanted to show off, that I was the dishonor of the family and told me to put on a winter heavy jacket. I refused to, in tears, trying to explain that I just felt too hot and that it made me dizzy. She pulled my hair, throwing me on the ground, and started hitting me everywhere, even cutting me with her nails, while choking my screams. She went on with that for like five minutes, while I was crying and screaming, and when she finally left me, I was bleeding from both my arms, and my legs and arms and chest were all purple and black. But this is just one example, it kept happening almost every two or three days. And it went on for three years. Both my mum and dad used to call me a whore, a bitch, a useless person, stupid, meaningless, the worst thing that happened in their lives. But the worst was when my dad would hit me. He is really big and so fucking strong, whenever he'd hit me i would feel a pain I cannot describe. A fucking pain that fucking went on for three fucking years, I swear, I used to get hit so much that now as now I am almost insensible to pain. I can break a bone, get a really deep cut, pour myself in boiling or freezing water and feel pretty much nothing. That's how much of it I had to bear. Thinking about it now makes me feel so pathetic and powerless that I want to crawl into a fucking ball and disappear forever. Which is what I wished for a very long time. The real pain wasn't even seeing  my two parents, the two people who gave me life, coloring me black and green and purple and pouring their own child's blood over and over, it's the way it felt emotionally. I used to cry every night for hours, wondering what I did wrong to deserve all of that. The first year, the stupid me thought it was actually my problem, that I was the wrong one. But, beggining from the second, I just...I couldn't stand that anymore, I started getting sick of it. So sick of it that I started fighting back, hitting them with whatever I got to defend myself, biting them, running away. One day my mum almost choked me, and I fought back harf because I couldn't actually breathe. That day I screamed so much I lost my voice. When I hit my dad, he called the police (people he knew well) and made up that I was the first who attacked them and that I was crazy, I came in crying unable to speak but of course, they believed them, who were faking tears and all, and they told me if it happened again ""they would make me understand what pain is"". After that, I had become really strong so that they stopped abusing me phisically because I could run away or fight back really well; but of course, the verbal teasing wouldn't stop. The basic concept they made is that I am a whore, and apparently the only reason is that I am a girl: they call me a whore just because I wear t-shirts and shorts in summer. I am almost 16 now, and the verbal shit never stopped. We just stopped talking. When I started High School things calmed down a little: it was as if we left our past behind and started all over again: that was because in all of this I had kept being the first of the class, and they wanted to show everyone how smart THEY MADE ME. I loved studying because it was my only way out of all that shit, I became a science lover, I still loved to read and had won many writing prizes, because all that mental freedom, the knowledge, made me feel free. I was not allowed to go out almost never, and if I did, I had to call them every 10 minutes and send pictures of where I was. It made me feel like I'd never become like them. Unfortunately, I didn't realize I had became so violent that I started hating everyone and everything, pretty much because they parents loved them unconditionally, and I lacked love my whole life. I never had real friends. My whole family is fucked up, and they ignore my existence or insult me together with my parents. I hated everyone and everything, and I started being really aggressive to my classmates. I had so much anger, resentment, pain, grudges, things I knew I could never actually forget, that raging at everyone was the only way I had to take it out. I had became exactly like them. After me beggining high school, they made discussions out of anything. My mum didn't want me to shave, she didn't want me to talk to boys, she would check my phone twice a day trough chats, gallery, all my browser and socials history and everything, not wanting me to even swear or watch tv-series which involved love or violence, same for videogames. Eventually, I didn't listen to them and did everything I wanted. At some point I died my hair and they made a drama that went on for months, not letting me out as usual. I didn't want to anyway. I had reached a point of self-awareness that I knew by myself that I didn't want to drink, to smoke, to do drugs or attend disco parties: I only wanted to become someone and go away. An artist, a writer, a scientist. I kept on studying because it was my only hope. Then, I fell in love. My parents never knew and still don't know anything about it, because I'm pretty sure they'd abuse me more than they ever did. They want me to get married with someone they approve, with the same religion (I am an atheist, if a fucking god existed i would've never been trough all that shit). I fell in love with a guy my same age who pretty much went trough the same shit. He had also a girlfriend, if I can call that a girlfriend, who cheated on him with five different people. I helped him recover, it was a long distance relationship, but it was the first bit of love I ever tasted. I cannot describe how much I loved him; and still do. But we broke, today, because we kept arguing and he'd become really violent towards me. At that point, I lost it. I had enough of everything.
Why did he want to kill himself because of a fucking piece of shit who cheated on him a billion times with five different people, but insults me who have always been super loving and kind? Why? What did I do wrong?
Why have my parents treated me this way all my life? What have I done so fucking wrong? They should've been proud of an indipendent girl who can stand by herself and who is smart. But I see that every other parent loves they child no matter what, even if they are wasted, helpless, bad people, wicked, no matter the way they are. Why? FUCKING WHY? The only good thing in this shit is that I wrote a book, it was my life dream, 30 chapters, more than two hundred pages. I hoped that if it got published, I could get myself money and go away from the people who never loved me. I had enough feeling useless, worthless, invisible, nobody. But it's not getting published because they do not want to, so I deleted it. 

I will never be capable of living knowing all the shit that happened to me. I will never feel happy, because I never knew how it feels.
I am sick of being abused every day
I am sick of being called a monster by my classmates because of a behavior I wouldn't have if it wasn't for my parents.
I am sick of being shamed for things I never did.
I am sick of being the innocent one suffering.

I feel like either Killing myself or them every day more. My life isn't done, it had never begun in first place. But I heard tons of 10 years old telling they want to kill themselves because they didn't get a videogame they wanted or shit like that, when I was abused for years. I will live for my own pride. But it will be awful.

659,"Hey everyone, this is my first post.

So... as the title suggests... I don't care anymore. Today as I sit at my desk in my office, I feel like I could walk out, get in my car, and never come back. I've recently pulled 12, 13, 14 hour days, and the work is just never ending. I used to could knock out long days with no problem, but last Thursday, I honestly woke up and hated everything I do, and I hate the person I am.

I will be 32 in 11 days. And I feel like I wasted my life. I feel like I sacrificed everything to work. So yeah, whoo hoo... I'm successful and I make a lot of money, but I don't have anything to show for it. I don't have a family. I don't have a serious relationship. I was going to get married to a man I spent 10 years with, but he got bored and decided I was no longer enough for him. We broke up when we were 26. My mom, my aunts and uncles, my cousin, and my grandmother are all I've got... and my mom's been seriously ill lately. But she won't go to the freaking doctor.

I honestly don't fucking care anymore. Everything I do is like Groundhog Day. It's like... do I really have 4 years experience at my current job, or just 1 year experience repeated 3 times?

I have friends, and a curated online presence with thousands of ""friends"" on facebook and instagram. I have good relationships with my friends when we hang out in person. But I feel like I'm worn out with everything. Everywhere I turn, there's another magazine to read, another skill to learn. I have to always be at the top of my game at all times. A late submission on a deadline, delayed timelines... all of this makes me feel like I'm not on top of anything anymore.

662,"Let's say you have a blocked nose. After a day or two, you can't really remember what it was like to breathe properly. You try for a while to remember but you can't, because your mind took it for granted that you'd be able to breathe properly. A few days later, you have fixed the problem and you cxan breathe again. You can barely remember what it was like to have a blocked nose. This is the experience of a healthy person.

Let's say your nose has been blocked for years. Not only can you not remember what it was like breathe freely, you are not convinced that you've ever been able to breathe freely. It's been like this for so long that you can't understand what it would mean to breathe freely.
Let's say, during these years, all aspects of your life and personal ability have degraded. Things that were once trivial are now impossible. Those around you noticed this, but shamed you. They said you were lazy. They said that you consider how your failures affect them. They call you selfish.

Let's say you've done some thinking about whether or not your nose is blocked. You seem to have the symptoms but to blame your multiple and impressive failures on a blocked nose seems like a cop-out. After all, you've heard the stories. A person with circumstances much worse than yours, with a condition much more severe than yours, managed to succeed. Surely if they can do it with those circumstances, your situation should be a landslide. But it isn't. 

Let's say you've thought about your situation some more. You've decided that there are 2 possible situations you are in and 2 solutions.
The first situation is that your nose is actually blocked. It hasn't always been this way and there actually is an external force warping your mind. How fucking weak would you have to be in order for a nose so lightly blocked that you have to seriously think about whether it is even there, to ruin your life? How fucking pathetic do you have to be for you not to find the drive to fix it? How lazy does someone have to be to wallow in a blocked nose, sitting in their room and waiting for the days to pass. It may not have been your fault that your nose was blocked, but you still have failed at every opportunity. You will continue to fail. The only escape is actual fucking work, or death. And we both know you can't work for shit.

Let's say that a part of you is unconvinced that your nose is truly blocked. That part of you thinks that you are making all of this up just yourself and other that this isn't your fault. It twists your thoughts of self-care into thoughts of shame. You can say all you want. You can lie to therapists. You can lie to friends. You can lie to parents, siblings, strangers and even yourself. But I know you. I know what you are. I know you are a sack of worthless garbage who has brought but dissapointment upon those who had audacity to believe you could succeed at anything you tried. You try to make yourself feel better by saying your condition has made you lazy, unmotivated, uncaring, unlovable, unlikeable and unhappy. But I know you. I know that those things are the centre of you. You will know nothing but failure and you will drag down those who care enough to watch. Until they will give up on you. Your future is a lonely spiral into the depths of human failure. You should just kill yourself before they give up you. They'll be able to pretend that you would have been able to pull yourself out of your hole. People tend to romanticize the memory of people who kill thenselves after all.

Let's say you've thought about all this, but you still haven't thought about that other solution. You've covered the two situations and you've pondered the same solution for them both. You surmise that the other solution must be to, somehow, get better. Or, at least, not get worse. You don't know how you might do this, but it seems like the kind of solution that most people would suggest, so surely there is merit there. You decide to make a reddit post, at 5am in the morning. You don't like saying the word ""Noseblock"". You don't know why. You decide to replace it with something else, just so you can get your thoughts out without cringing to yourself. 

I just want to die.

I also have a sister whos 3 years younger than me and now a stepbrother thats 4-5 days old. idk if this was neccesarry but it thought it would be nice if you knew who i am. 

&amp;#x200B;

Well since about 7 months ago i've kinda lost it, when it comes to grades, friends etc. I've skipped school ALOT (and just stayed at home ) and i havent hung around with my friends in forever except for some isolated cases. Im conflicted now because skipping school is now coming back to bite me in the ass, my grades have plummeted and i feel like im not in touch with my friends. At first i thought i was just lazy since ive always been a very lazy person but now that im trying to go to school again i just cant do it, i despise most of the subjects i have (naturalscience) except for biology and english since its so easy for me (yeah i know you might not see it in this text). I know self classification of psychological diseases and such is a bad idea and that my generation (r/2meirl4meirl etc) throw around depression alot but im just not feeling fine. Im not feeling so horrendously bad that i want to kill myself, i loathe the idea of it but its been on my mind more than id like, i feel anxious about many things and im never truly happy (yes i play games and that but i feel like those are just temporary rushes of ""i did something good woho""). Also since ive been skipping school i havent eaten as well as i should since im not eating whats provided at school.

&amp;#x200B;

Well the paragraph before this was just nonsense of me describing myself, im going back and forth to writing this text but in general the title sums up what i feel. I feel like i lack a sense of direction, except for the temporary sense of relief i gain when i paint a model, play games or read books im never really happy. I have no idea what to do with my life after im done with my ""highschool"" except for finishing the mandatory months in the army. I guess im just asking for what people in my situation have done or think i can do to find a direction or what else. Someone with real depression might read this and think what the fuck am i going on about im just lazy and that might be right, i might just be venting. I think im going to read what other people are writing here, idk why. Sorry for the hastily written text, i just felt that i wanted it over with.",0

Never married no kids my dreams are long gone I realize at 39 my life is half over and I have nothing to show for it. A few years ago I just stopped caring about anything. I'm done. I'm just waiting to die. I promised my mom I wouldn't kill myself because my grand father and aunt commited suicide and I don't want her to lose her father sister and son to suicide but at this point I will do it the moment she is gone. I'm in great health I know my inactivity is starting to cause heart problems but guess what? Dont care. In fact I hope it kills me so I can get out life soon without actually committing suicide. Ive heard it will get better for years bit it doesnt. In fact things manage to find a way to get worse. I lost my health insurance so I cant afford my meds and they barely helped when I had them.

669,"Im 30. Two kids. 4 yr w\autism and a 1 yr old.
Ive been with my old lady for 7yrs known her for 12.
Shes got spinal issues and epilepsy/seizures

Lately ive just been feeling so off. Normally i ignore alot about life and keep pushing thru. But the consistent nagging from my SO has me walking on eggshells and i just dont wanna be home to hear all the bitching. Whether its the roof that needs fixing, my hyper active 4yr old or generally my annoying habits.
 I work asphalt construction in michigan and i work 14+hour days 6 days a week and i get 4 months off in winter. Which i still have to work with lesser hours. Im able to provide and pay all our bills but it never seems like its enough. Right now I've been on edge cuz with being on call for my asphalt job and juggling home life I'm expected to wait on her and the kids constantly. We had an uneasy understanding that while im the breadwinner and worker she should be the stay at home mother and i help out where possible. She doesnt need to work cuz she gets over 1g a month from her mothers SSI because she had passed away.  I do the outside chores, get  all of the groceries [she doesnt drive] and run errands. 
Shes constantly attacking me for playing video games while she hides out in the kitchen making jewelry and staring at her phone but says i spend too much time on the internet myself. Nothing i do seems right to her.  
I'm just overloaded lately with feelings of guilt and suicide. Like. The kids'll be self sufficient in a few years, my 4yr old basically keeps himself going besides needing snacks drinks and occasionally play time with us. But she keeps going in the negative with a defeatist type attitude. Ive got 27 more years before iam able to retire and my job is so physically demanding that some days i just ache from being alive. I know shes in constant pain herself with her spinal issues. I just cant really get over the fact a few months ago our 4yr old threw up some food while she took a nap. She heard it and came running out screaming at me and him for never letting her rest and I remember her saying that she hated me and him and that we just cause her constant headaches and that having kids was a mistake.  And im a lazy good for nothing that wont lift a finger cuz im busy trying to escape our home life. In a sense. Yeah. I need tons of breaks. I had to quit smoking pot for my union job andi hate drinking. So occasionally i try to spend 2-3 hours over at a buddy's house to unwind. I brought it up to her about hating me and she said she didnt remember saying it anx we'll be fine for a few days. 
She was miserable living with her dad before we started living together but im thinking now its just her reality tunnels veiwpoint to see things in thay light. She has anxiety issues and uses them not to go out into the real world anx when we do she gets so mad and frustrated she makes scenes and accuses me that its easy for me to be out in public. But truth is i hate it too but its something we gotta do, right? We have to get groceries and wait in long lines. I have to do these things because i must. 
Idk guys. Sry to vent. Dont get me wrong im no piece of cake myself and surely have alot of flaws. But i love my family but i just cant get the thought of driving into a wall or whatever out of my mind. I even started looking into life insurance policies so if i died theyd be taken care of.
Idk. Im just tired guys. I joke about all the time. Thought about it since i was 16.
Im selfish lazy arrogant etc i know. Its just i cant talk to my family. They think its just another joke. But come on. A buddy of mine died of an overdose and instead of feeling sad, i felt jealous. Wrong right? Idk sry for the vent again",0
670,"I was a very hyper extroverted kid when I was younger and I loved it. 

I used to be the kid that ran around house parties dancing like Michael Jackson and telling jokes making my whole family laugh.

All the way from elementary school to the end of middle school EVERYONE knew me. 

I made everyone laugh, was constantly told I should be a comedian. Even people who I didn't know came up to me and said they'd want to hang out with me.

There wasn't a ***single*** kid in my school (quite large) that didn't know my name. Bullies even listened to me like I was the voice of reason. The popular girls would come to my house and grab me to hang out with their high school friends. I was liked by all the ""cliques"" and life was great.

Then, my grandfather died a few days before I graduated middle school. I graduated, skipped meeting up with all my friends, taking pictures, the after party and immediately left with my Mom to drive 4 hours away to take care of my grandmother. Who lives in the richest part of the US.

This is when my anxiety/depression started. My new school was much bigger, all the kids were rich and played sports, wore the nicest clothes, had awesome cars. I went from the most ""average joe"" school to the most preppy jockish school ever.

My parents are divorced, so my mom couldn't afford the fancy clothes the school was wearing. I sat alone at lunch every day, or hid in a cranny in some hallway rather than going to lunch at all. 

I hated my life. I had to see a doctor for medication. I was 14 at this time, and the doctor decided Xanax was the way to go. So I took it not knowing what it was, or how addictive it was, or how it made you act annoying and stupid. 

I kept the bottle in my backpack and took them ""as needed"" and by the end of the day I could barely stand up and I was slurring my words.

Jump forward a year, I'm a COMPLETE addict at 15. Trying new drugs, smoking cigarettes and weed. Still not talking to anyone in any classes.

My attendance dropped to 60% and I would go to school high on Xanax and weed. Going through every day like a zombie. Never leaving the house. I'd say if all throughout 4 years of highschool I said 1,000 words I'd be baffled.

My teachers clearly saw something was wrong with me, they'd talk to me privately and I'd explain my situation. My therapist would talk to my guidance counselor. 

Even though I did jack shit in school I guess the teachers felt bad and I managed to finish school with EXACTLY enough credits passing each class by the bare minimum.

Now I'm 23, still spend EVERY SINGLE DAY getting high on sickening amounts of drugs. My old friends are living their best lives, two of them have HOMES at 23.

I'm actually petrified of my future. I can't drive. I've never touched a girl. I had one job which took ALL of my courage to come in every day and I got fired for a mistake my manager made.

I take 16mg of Suboxone (to get off Oxy) every day, 75-100mg of Xanax, 3g of weed every day. I sit at the computer working on making money or playing video games, then I sleep.

I'm numb. I'm sad. The best years of my life have gone to waste. I can't face my family or leave my room during parties. I have 7 holes in my wall from getting too high and angry/depressed. 

I'm 5'5 as a guy, can't drive, only have 2 nice outfits which I haven't worn in years since I have no friends. I couldn't even go to my own cousin's wedding. 

To give you perspective, I used to play with this cousin constantly. We'd visit eachother and spend hours upon hours together. Now I can't even look him in the eyes. He has brought a wife to our parties for 4 years now and I haven't ever spoken to her one single time.

I'm so lost. I'm an extrovert stuck in an introvert's body. I truly believe I may never get out of this state because it's been this way from 14 to 23.",0
671,"I know I shouldn’t drink. I’ve tried to quit multiple times, but every time I just feel so bored and lonely throughout the day and night. I have severe IBS that makes it very hard for me to get out and socialise, and not drinking doesn’t seem to improve my symptoms at all (even after a few months sober). So I also drink to numb the discomfort of my symptoms.

673,"I feel as if I'm a star being sucked into a black hole all my light, my energy, my life being sucked into this inescapable darkness. A placid celestial body looking at the other stars and looking at them in jealousy drifting off into infinity, going somewhere. I feel as if I'm going nowhere stuck being forever drained in this black hole I call depression sucking my loves, passion, and my personality. I used to be passionate about things, such as violin and horror. I used to be able to practice for hours, I used to be really engaged into the horror community but I've lost interest in both of these. My violin playing is suffering, I used to strive to be in the Phoenix symphony; but my crippling self doubt and my lack of motivation has slaughtered that like a wolf to a baby lamb. Not only my performance in violin is suffering but so are my grades in school. Oh how I hate school, every single damn second feels the exact same as the last in which I feel would be better spent if they didn't exist, learning useless garbage such as how to find the area of a circle, immediately forgetting the material as soon as I walk out the exam room. I feel as if my 'friends' don't care about me despite there being no good evidence to support this. I wish I could come out and openly show my feelings, but i'm to much of a coward to so. I constantly contemplate suicide regularly, I just want all the tho it's to stop, I don't care anymore. I know I want to die. What's stopping me from doing it is the possibility that I survive. I will for ever look at myself as a failure who can't even kill themselves successfully, and the dissaproving eyes of my family under florecent lights in the emergency room. I cannot buy myself a gun because I am a minor, and even then, there's still a slim chance that I'll survive and left horibbly deformed. When I told my parents about my depression, they ridiculed me. Calling me a snowflake when not even using the damn insult right. Making the conversation about themselves, calling me entitled. They do not understand what depression is. All I really wanted, was empathy and help. I have not forgiven them for that and I probably never will. The one time I ask them of anything at the time when I need someone most they ridicule me. It boils my blood everytime I think of it. Now all I do now, I listen to music I used to have such passion for. And sleep. I'm trying my absolute hardest to keep going. They you it gets better, until you wake up a few hundred mornings later and realize nothing has changed. I hate the way I look, I can never satisfy myself with whatever I do. Whatever I try, until I just stop trying. I've given up on fashion, I do the bare minimum to look presentable in public. I don't know how to break free of this black hole before if completely consumes me. ",0
674," Before I start a little bit of background:

   I've been seeing a therapist for the past four years now and I've been off my medication for a little less than a year in order to see if I can cope without it. It's been going well, I don't feel a constant need to harm or isolate myself, but I feel ""off"".

  Unlike when I was depressed where I felt a good array of emotions from sadness, anger, and some degree of happiness I feel rather... Robotic. I don't know how to explain it to my therapist but I was hoping maybe someone else knows what I'm talking about? Where it feels like you aren't thinking despite having thought, where it feels like you have no emotion despite being able to laugh and cry and all that, and where it feels like you're numb for the most part.

&amp;#x200B;

 Before being taken off this medication I was extremely into writing, so much so I hoped to be a writer some day. I've been writing since I was twelve and it was my solace during my darkest of days and yet... I can't be bothered with it. It was my passion and yet I can't think whenever I try to write. 

  This goes for reading as well. I often have to reread every single page I look at just to comprehend what I've just read. It's like the words don't click in my mind, it's just a mass til I force myself to focus. 

  I have a hard time thinking in general, anymore. I have thoughts all the time but it's like I can't even grasp my own mind anymore. 

  

Does anyone else feel like this? It can't be withdrawal from the medication since it's been nearly a year now, so what on earth is going on?",0

677,"Ive been crying in public quite often recently. At work rn, and had a crying session in the bathroom

To anyone who wears makeup: sitting down and bending forward makes your tears fall straight to the floor from your eyes.

678,"So my wife and I have BP. She was going through a depressed state due to stress prior to the death and I tried to be supportive, get her mind off things and I still am. Yesterday was when we learned a really really close friend of hers passed from possible overdose, not sure if intentional or not atm. 

She had tried in the past to OD, and she is kicking herself she didn't reach out in the past when she had a feeling she should. I tell her she wouldn't have known this was going to happen. She agreed, but I know she's still upset at herself. It's really made her want to self harm again, and she's been a year clean of it, so I'm try to keep her mind off that at least, which makes it a little harder. 

I recently increased one of my meds, and it's like things changed even more than before when I was on a lower dose. My thought processes seem different and a little less foggy. 

 Since the increase I have felt like I need to use my new state to bring and build her back up. I have noticed though that although I feel like I'm being more supportive by just being there and not giving advice or saying things other then I'm sorry, and agreeing when she breaks down and says things like ""people don't die this young"" ""I was wishing it was a bad joke"" and that she just can believe he's gone. 

I feel like I can't really think of what to say, or do when she's breaking down, or saying some things. Saying she's fighting back tears, that it's not OK to cry or be emotional. I tell her it nothing to be ashamed of, that she lost someone that was a major part of her life and its a big deal. But she seems like she doesn't believe me.

I'm just being quiet, saying I know when she brings up things like it shouldn't happen etc. And just holding her and saying it's ok to cry, it's not a bad thing to.

I know things like ""gods plan"" ""he's in a better place"" and that bs doesn't help. I remember reading that there really isn't anything you can say when someone is in mourning to help. So I've kept my answers short and trying to enforce that what she's feeling and saying is true and real.

Other then that, and even though I've been depressed for so long, I just can't think of what to do or say to be supportive. Of her mourning, of her severe depression before and currently in this situation.

 I'm afraid that if I don't say something I'll come across as uncaring and not wanting to help, or that I don't want to hear or talk about it. I do, I want to help her and help take some of the burden, to be there. I just don't know what to do or say, what will help and what will hinder. I mean I think I know, I just don't know if it's a good idea. 

I'm trying to just be quiet, let her mourn, and just be there to hold her. But I feel like there should be more I should be doing.

Any suggestions on what to do/say? Is there more I can be doing? I'm just lost and I feel bad as I feel like I should know what I wanted said or done when I was depressed.

Lately things have been not okay but as close to it as I’ve felt in awhile, but it’s starting to get bad again. For some reason I can’t keep the thoughts away anymore, I can’t avoid thinking about what a failure I am, how I am the cause for my own depression and how I’m the one keeping myself from getting better.

During my 20 years of life the only friend I’ve had is an online one, this friendship has made a massive difference in my life, mostly good, but also bad. Things got rocky for awhile and I had lost my only friend, but they came back, it’s not the same though, I have a constant fear that I’ll run them off again and this fear keeps me from enjoying our friendship and keeps me feeling depressed even when I’m having a good conversation with them.

Having nobody else is extremely difficult, even more so since I don’t have anyone that I can meet up with in person and do things with. I am always incredibly lonely and miserable and I see no change in my future.

I feel so incredibly lost, my life, in my eyes, will never improve. It’s an awful existence but unfortunately suicide isn’t an option because I’ve seen how devastating it is for families and I love mine too much to make them suffer.",0

685,"I’m awful at writing but I think this might help me and maybe someone could give me advice as I don’t know what to do. I’m 21 so I haven’t ever done anything like this.

3 weeks ago I worked for dad and I have been for about a year now, but he’s not a very nice person to me and I’m not just saying that, he controls every aspect of my life, from the way I talk and act. Now I’m not scared or threatened by anyone really unless it’s mike Tyson or whatever but he actually makes me feel scared, like I’m nothing. He treats me like I know nothing. 

Now he doesn’t believe in depression, I got told last year, that I may be suffering with it, so I told him in confidence and the first thing he says is “never had that when I was your age” which annoyed me I guess. I fear him so much but a part of me wants to lash out at him. 

Now at work he just treat me like shit. Always has to put me down and all I want is him to be proud. Anyways so 3 weeks ago I lost my job with him as he’s greedy and wanted more money from people who give us contracts. We work in construction. 

But a month prior to this I’d just got my first flat with my girlfriend which was great! But now I feel like I’m going to loose it all. I’ve got no money as I’ve put it away for rent and bills, yet the old man is trying to get me to do my driving test, telling me how that money is no good sat in my bank. But I don’t want to spend any of it until I get a new job? 

But anyway about a week ago I’ve been really breaking down, I’ll go to the bathroom and burst into tears constantly, my heart is racing, I can’t sleep and I think I’m having suicidal thoughts. Like I’m not sure if if I’m serious all not because I’m always thinking about it, ever since I was quite young so not sure if it’s Just me being dramatic? I don’t know but I think I need help, just advice on how to deal with this. 

That job was literally all I lived for, it was a shit job but it gave me structure, it gave me a reason to wake up in the morning and it made me feel good. I’m worried about getting another job as I’m quite uneducated as when I was younger my dad made me believe that I wouldn’t need a education so I feel completely trapped and ruined by this man. I hate him so much. 

I want to keep you all updated on what happens next as right now I’m unemployed with a flat and extremely upset. I’m sorry if this is the wrong sub reddit just didn’t know where else to go. If your going to say anything mean just don’t, I can’t express how much I couldn’t deal with anymore negativity at the minute. 

So thank you to whoever reads all this, I’m going to try and sleep, I’ll reply in the morning!",0
686,I tried to OD Yesterday and I basically have had to spend the whole day in hospital feeling like Hell.  The worst part is the psychological strain.  Everyone at my school basically knows what I did and I think I'm going to get treated badly because of it.  Also one of the drugs I took was a deliriant so I can't remember what I did.  I remember taking the drugs but nothing after that.  So I think I made a fool of myself at school.

The few things keeping me from going through with suicide is the fact that I'd leave my little brother without any siblings, my mother and father would be devastated for life. I also always hold on for that little bit of hope one day i would just wake up and be a completely different person with a new outlook on life, so far I wake up and I still see myself in the mirror.

Lately I’ve been regretting a lot of things that has happened in my life (I’m only 16) and I’ve been doing terribly at school which makes me feel shit and then my parents are counting on me to do good at school and it’s to much pressure plus the constant bullying at school doesn’t help. I don’t know what to do anymore all of my ‘friends’ are now gone I have no one to talk to about my feelings so I sit in my room getting more and more depressed. what doesn’t help is that My ex has started to get everyone to call me useless and I’m honestly starting to believe them.Also I don’t know how to open up about my sexuality I am bisexual and whenever I’ve told people who I thought were my friends they just laughed at me and it makes me feel like I don’t even belong on this earth I hate my sexuality I wish I could be ‘normal’. I really need people I can actually talk to about how I feel I always put on an act when I’m around my ‘friends’ but it sucks I need to be able to let my emotions out to someone and I can’t exactly talk to my parents they wouldn’t understand and I wouldn’t want to trouble them with my problems.

691,"For anyone reading this post, Thank you. I just found this group today and it's been so helpful in making me feel slightly less alone. 

I'll start by saying that I have been dealing with severe depression and anxiety for 10 years now (I'm 24). It's always in waves and used to sort itself out eventually. I'm currently worse than I have ever been. I'm just so fucking exhausted and my anxiety makes me feel nauseous daily. I have seen multiple psychologist (one told me I would die like my mother in the first session if I touched any alcohol or drugs).

I try to go to the gym regularly, I have a trainer, I have a loving partner and a puppy. I eat relatively healthy and have a full time job. I'm doing my best and trying so hard but it feels like if I'm not happy now then I never will be. I start with a new psych in a couple of days and I feel like I'm just going through the motions to make people feel better. My boss told me to leave my emotions at the door and smack a smile on my face no matter how I feel and I'm so tired of faking it all fucking day that I get straight into bed as soon as I get home because I'm making people worried and uncomfortable.

My partner is so amazing and does his best to help me but he is a very positive person and it feels like I'm drowning and putting rocks in his pockets to drag him down with me.
It's becoming more and more apparent that this is it for me. And I feel like the worst most selfish person in the world for forcing my partner to be enduring this with me.

I guess I'm posting here because I just wanna know if anyone can help me. I'm so lost and I don't know how to help myself. I know no one can fix me but does anyone have any suggestions on what to try next?

705," 

I've been with my girlfriend for nearly 6 months now. She has severe clinical depression and has been hospitalized for it in the past. When we first met, she was in a better state and the relationship was pretty amazing by all means. She had even told me she felt me being in her life was improving her condition.

Over the last 2-3 months, her condition has steadily deteriorated and she has become very distant. She has also returned to therapy. She told me she wants to take a break from the relationship as she feels its overwhelming her. We sometimes go days without texting and even when I occasionally initiate, I don't get a response.

Despite her depression, she has so many qualities in her that I absolutely love and when she was in a better state of mind, we could often talks for hours without a pause. I would really like to maintain this relationship as I do care for her deeply and I do see a future with her. For those of you in a similar situation or those of you suffering from depression, how would you approach this? Is there a way to be proactive about the relationship other than just leaving her alone for the time being?

706,"Do people without this *stuff* ever actually understand how it is to have no motivation at all to do anything? Sometimes I don't want to even wake up, it's too much effort. I don't have it in me to keep up with what is expected of me and it just causes a somewhat complicated feedback loop of stress as i get more stressed because my grades fall and i cant keep them up, which causes me to be more abusive to my friends, which causes me to get more upset with myself and more stressed and for my friends to become more distant, which just causes me to be worse. 

I just want to stay on call with my best friend, and not get out of bed. I just want death. I can't stop fantasying about suicide and I'm getting tempted to bring rope to school and hang myself in the forest that surrounds it. I don't know what to do anymore my emotions and thoughts are a mess and I can't even sleep in peace anymore as I get nightly nightmares, often multiple a night, all about torturing and killing my friends or me burning. The good ones are the ones where I burn my house down, when I have those I don't wake up to a panic attack. 

I'm getting a reoccurring nightmare where I torture and kill my two best friends and the worst part about it is I somewhat like it. Not the actual torturing and killing, I don't think, but the feeling of control and power, the abusiveness. It feels like I was born to abuse and I don't want to, I can't but my mind keeps begging me, forcing me to abuse.   
I think that's an excuse, though. I control myself. I choose to be abusive to my friends, to manipulate and control them. I choose to be like this, I think. I hate myself for it, I won't forgive myself for it.

715,"In therapy group at the hospital they showed us this educational video from PBS where they discuss emotion, psychology, and the brain. In the video they interview this professor who wrote a book called “Why Zebras Don’t Get Ulcers.” It brings up the idea that humans are the only living things with such complex emotions and because of this we dwell and ruminate and it takes a toll; a Zebra, however, can go from eating grass to escaping a lion attack, only to happily go back to eating grass again once safe as though nothing happened. I thought this was really interesting and it brought with it the motto: Be a zebra. When you’re attacked by life, as hard as it is to let it go, if you can be a zebra and move forward leaving the negative experience in the past then it’s not as terrible. I don’t know if that makes sense to you but it really helped me. It’s also important to remember that as painful and difficult as it can be to simply be human, it can also be so beautiful and incredible.

&amp;#x200B;

I am 23, going to turn 24 next month, and I sort of had an epiphany today. I was helping my youngest sibling with choosing classes for high school and realized if I ever move out she'll be stuck with my dysfunctional, divorced and sociopathic parents.

  
My sibling is tougher than me and my parents are way more stable then I was a kid so I don't think they'll end up like me. All socially stunted, anxious and constantly stressing themselves. I am fine with staying here to take care of  them since most of the time I'm the only adult in the house watching over them. Plus I have nowhere else to go really.

&amp;#x200B;

But that thought sort of cemented what I've been frustrated about.

  
To be honest, I pretty much wrote all of my life story here by accident and deleted it. I'll just go over the backstory relevant to my current predicament instead.

  
I've been emotionally abused since I was about 5. My father cheated on my mother repeated and abused her mentally as well to the point where she had BWS and was devastated when he up and left. She took me and my siblings to another city closer to her hometown, which she avoided out of the shame of knowing the people there knew my dad slept around with people there, and was incredibly unstable for about two years. I took care of my siblings throughout that time but recall little of it because I have a poor long-term memory due to trauma. I had no idea I was depressed throughout pretty much all of my childhood until college where I learned about emotional abuse  and started to look into my past because I was suspicious I was a victim of it along with some physical abuse. I wasn't beaten to bad though, I mean I never broke a bone or anything. I only feel I need to say that because I recognize some people here must have gone through worse and I don't want anyone to confuse any of the little bit of pain I went through with the horror other have endured. I believe have just always been a weak idiot, that's why a few beatings sunk into me pretty badly.

&amp;#x200B;

Around the age of 5, pretty much every member of my family recognized that I was a new person overnight. I went from loud, grouchy and a pretty mouthy kid to the way I am now. Timid, nervous and unconfident. I had a lot of trouble dealing with being away from my siblings, stress from college and dealing with learning about my childhood (well really ongoing) emotional abuse. I got very very low but never made an attempt, I called the hotline one night where I was so upset I was pretty much just thinking of why not to do it. I was calmed down by venting to someone and struggled to make it through the last two months of school, and two full summer classes I needed to take due to my depression making it hard to attend classes. I wanted to just drop out but after talking with my mom she convinced me to at least try to stay in.

&amp;#x200B;

After that I came home and make very, very little money doing writing commissions. I didn't care about how little money I made or work I got. I just needed to cut myself off from all the crap that made me so depressed. I started taking medicine and slowly got better.   


Two years passed and I stopped taking the medicine, with my doctor's permission, and have been relatively good. I mean I don't want to die as much but I really feel pathetic.

&amp;#x200B;

I just can't believe I'm going to turn 24 next month and I made no progress, all that shit I went through  was for nothing. I lived and got that degree but due to me being a depressed piece of shit I never did a thing with it and I'm just wasting my life.

&amp;#x200B;

I serious question why I didn't just die in that apartment. It would've been the best way to get back at everyone who made me feel so damn worthless. My parents care about me in their own sick way, they truly do and I can see it but they are so damn cold. Part of me wanted to just let go of everything up there to make them suffer like I suffered but then my siblings would've been devastated.

  
My little brother and sister would be stuck with the short-sighted, outdated, bumfuck jackasses I call parents. So, in the end I don't regret living. I just feel like a damn idiot. The worst part is my family likes me being here. Because I'm here my mom can work longer shifts to support the middle sibling go to college (since my father in his vast wisdom deemed the middle child too stupid for college and refused to help when he put a damn failure like me through) knowing I'm watching my sister and maintaining the house since my mother just literally sleeps and works. My mother cares, I know that, just the way she can tear into my siblings just infuriates me. It's nothing like when I was a kid since my dad isn't telling her what to do but the little glimpses what they used to do to me being said my siblings makes my blood boil. 

&amp;#x200B;

I am not sure what I should do. I never got a real job and I can't work anywhere locally due to me being unable to drive. I live in shit hick city so we don't have any real public transit or anything. Looking for online jobs has been difficult and pretty stressful too so I usually just give up mid-search and just keeping doing more of the same. Maintain house, fret over making commission deadlines, make shit money, give 95-98% of money over to pay for the computer I use to make shit money (due to me being clumsy) and repeat.

&amp;#x200B;

After thinking about it, I wanted to get one more thing off my chest. One thing I forgot to mention earlier about college was that I learned just the slightest movement would force me to unconsciously cower and shake in public. As I got more depressed and recalled my trauma it was almost like the muscle memory of how I dealt with physical abuse as a child returned. It was so embarrassing, if anyone reached past me or walked to close I'd just shiver and recoil away violently. I couldn't even speak for about a minute when I would get like that. I started walking to classes on lesser used, longer paths so I wouldn't risk bumping into anyone. Even just being looked at by somebody made me sick and want to hide my face. I can't believe I almost forgot about this since I don't do this anymore. I was so pathetic.

&amp;#x200B;

Damn, this whole post is all over the place. I make little sense when I get emotional so I apologize to anyone who read this. Feel free to say whatever you're thinking. Even if you think I'm whining like a jackasses I'm up for it. Just explain how you came to that conclusion. I kind of want someone else to pick my mind.  ",0

since my girlfriend left me a couple of days ago my mood has taken a nose dive. ive been more suicidal than usual but still to afraid to just slit my wrists open already. over a year ago i toyed with a gun in my hand contemplating if i should destroy myself but i didnt. i wish i had. 

i wish people would stop telling me to move on. i dont think anyone i know understands how i feel. and im not just trying to be angsty. i genuinely feel very lost in my mind. im constantly reliving all the shit that broke me down to my lowest points in life. 

i hate it when people tell me to, ""stop being sad"". thats just retarded. if i could i would. if could stop thinking i would.

i dunno im just running out of steam
i dont have the energy to cry my self to sleep anymore
my heart can't take anything else
im just so empty

Yesterday it started, then it seemed okay but it started again then I couldn't stop crying and I couldn't function at work anymore. I kept trying to go home but management kept wanting me to stay then got sick of my shit then let me go home.

I don't know what to do tomorrow. If I should just take another day off. I'm considering quitting, I'm considering killing myself. Yet I need money to fund my life and therapy and I keep pussing out of suicide because its painful and has a high chance of not working.

When will I ever have that much fun and that many connections with so many people in my life again? The way adults operate there is no way. We all know how much more fake and harder it is to make friends as an adult. It sucks cock. I feel like I have to put up facades and masks all day everyday just to appear like I’m an adult and it’s boring and soul crushing. I miss the days when I’d wake up, pick up my friend (who I haven’t talked to in 2 years) smoke a bowl, goof off, go to class then skip Lunch go smoke with some friends and then after school go to work and then come home and Hang out with people or chill. Therapy was a better experience as a teen. I also feel like I could talk about my problems more openly because people like to help high school kids more then they like to help adults. People don’t give a fuck about you once you got that 21+ range. My dopamine is fried and I’m a shell of a shell of a shell of who I used to be. Now I live in an autopilot zombie induced blur. I understand I’m being nostalgic about the past. But, if we’re being completely Honest this fried zombie state I’m in doesn’t even due justice to really speak to the nostalgia of the past.

I, 18M, got a job! I finished the paperwork today and even got my ID for it. It's relavent work experience, too! My parents are proud and so is my girlfriend. 

However, I hate that I can't see this as an opportunity. I can't be happy about it. I can't get myself to go to the gym or my classes. English 250, Math 166, CprE. I'll lay in bed for hours on end waiting for the smallest sliver of motivation telling me to get my ass up and be productive. But by then, all of my classes and times to be productive are past me. I cant get myself to eat. I'm lucky if I eat a meal a day sometimes. 

I'm crying as I write this, not knowing if I should feel sorry or mad at myself. I keep saying, ""I gotta change"" and, ""Tomorrow will be better."" It's not. It never is. I know I am stupid to think that everything will just slide into place, I know it won't. Little by little is the way to go. But I am past that point. Everything moves too fast for a little to be a lot. 

My girlfriend is the best person in the world and is always there to help and listen. I could never leave her. She is so kind and caring. I am afraid that my depression is hurting us, though. 

I really just want to be happy with myself. I've done counseling through my university, I've tried exercises and routines that should help and I have been on heavy medication. I don't know what box to fill out under the ""Do you have any disabilities"" question on campus surveys and job paperwork. 

How do you get yourself up in the morning? How do you keep yourself on a routine that allows you to be successful? How do you pat yourself on the back?

I can’t tell him I want to commit suicide since that is such a manipulative abusive move. He’s not the reason I want to end my own life. 

My life makes me miserable and that’s why I’m so depressed. I put my energies to god/faith/religion but I’m still depressed.

I’ve been depressed since I was a teen. I’ve sought help, I’m on medication, I go to therapy. The suicidal thoughts still happen. I’m still depressed.

736,"There are three major things in my life at the moment: School, relationships, and my sport. Last semester I went through a breakup that was really rough on me. I began to feel very unimportant and undesirable and being depressed then really hurt me in school. I began to lose all focus and ended up doing so bad that I was put on probation from my major, meaning if I do bad again I will get kicked out. All while this was happening I had an escape into the club sport I play in college. I'm the captain of my team and love going to practice and helping and seeing my team get better.

&amp;#x200B;

Fast forward to this semester, I moved on to a new relationship, that isn't really official, but I worry about it all the time. I don't have any real reason to, I just sit and sulk in bad thoughts, thinking that this girl is going to leave me at any time now. All of my classes this semester are follow ups to the classes I took last semester, so I need to spend extra time to catch up on these, and sitting around worrying about nothing does not help. I've fallen so behind this semester that I am beginning to do poorly in school again, and am worrying about getting kicked out of my program.

&amp;#x200B;

My sport has a national event every year which we send an all star to. Being the captain, and from me thinking I am the best on the team, I was thinking I was easily going to be voted to represent our team, but I did not receive one single vote. This felt like a blow to my heart and honestly something that hurt me way more than it should have. I put in way too much work to not be representing our team in front of the whole league.

&amp;#x200B;

This happening to me just feels like too much and I don't know how to find the motivation to keep studying and pushing forward. I know that I need to work but whenever I try I get surrounded by negative thoughts and feelings. I don't know how to push forward and grind the rest of the semester to do the best that I can and stay in my program. I am really worried and don't know how to push myself.",0

My life wasnt always terrible it was ok up until i was 13 years old i noticed cuts on my friends arms they never wanted to talk about them i figured out the reason and that day i realized why they did it i went home found a knife and started scraping skin off my left arm by dragging the blade across my arm repeatedly eventually i began cutting and it got worse and worse met a girl who knew my issues i fell for her but we ended up splitting it tore me apart had a few others along the way nothing really serious all long distance aswell then i met her we will call her sarah she changed my entire life made me into who i am she saved my life multiple times we were inseparable i loved her to hell and back things were great we talked everyday all hours of the day we had so much fun lots of memories we were also very intimate i thought i had it all she was perfect in my eyes but i guess i was blinded to see that we did in fact have a few issues but she never communicated them to me and she tells me we broke up due to distance but i still believe it was more also because when she snaps at me she tends to tell the truth about how im lazy or how i wouldnt get a job no matter what it was really hurts when she says all this but its pretty true and she knows im kinda sensitive so i just feel as if she was yelling at me and she knows i hated it after we broke up i was in so much pain then the day things started to really fall apart it wasnt even month after we split we we just finshed fooling around and i got a message from someone on kik saying that i needed to leave sarah alone and that i was upsetting her so still on call with her i asked her who this person was we will call him tim she then hung up and i messaged her and kept calling her eventually she answered and asked me what i i ended up finding out shes been talking to tim since we broke up they met in a group chat and then eventually started dating not even a month after we split this is the most pain iv ever been through it killed me inside knowing she was with another guy especially so fast like was i that easy to replace? Did you really love me? How was is so easy for you to move on yet you got me here still strung out over you after like 3 years now.. We talked less and less sometimes she would disappear saying she dint wanna keep hurting me but i missed her and wanted her around i loved her very much but her bf found out very mad obviously so she had to hide us talking hes found out multiple times hes even faked being her i knew it was him tho which killed me inside aswell shes left and came back multiple times this has been going on for so long its kinda all i know lots of things happen i get hurt just not a great place to be in we still fool around behind his back and eventually i meet another girl that i end up dating we date for alittle while but it dint work out i was still madly inlove with sarah and i ended up cheating on that girl with sarah i know its a shitty thing to do wasnt proud of what i did gets worse between me and sarah at this point i realize im in to deep i love this girl so much that at this point i dont wanna let go cause if i do then all this pain iv gone through was for nothing fast forward to a couple weeks ago just talking like normal and she ended up not replying cool whatever i just figured she fell asleep and then i never got anything for a few days figured she was busy but it turns out she left again she said she was tired of causing me pain but i still want her around i love her more then anything in this world i miss her so much i wish so badly that she would just walk through that door and give me a big hug and tell me everythings gunna be ok cause without her im so lost im constantly lonely she was really the only person i talked to and i could be myself with i could be open i could tell her anything and she wouldnt judge me for it i feel like my best friend and my soulmate have been ripped my life and im left just torn in pieces i just really wish she would come back i know she thinks all she does is cause me pain but she does so much good that she doesnt realize she got a tattoo that has a special meaning for me and her and in it hidden is my initials to me thats a true connection worth keeping...

744,"Hi all, I hope the day is finding you well. 

Ok so, my depression comes and goes. And today has been so bad. I feel like I want to die, but know deep down I couldn’t ever do that to my family, even if they kinda treat me like an afterthought most of the time, I know this would destroy them, so I just sort of exist and hope my mood stays stable (which is not to say a good mood, just not a catastrophically bad mood). 

Today I was driving to work (a career which I feel very trapped in, and don’t like too much, but hey that’s life), and I find myself almost wishing for an accident to happen to me so I have a legitimate reason to be so upset.

I’ve almost gone to a psychiatric hospital before, but they said unless I’m thinking of self-harm, there’s not much cause for going and I should just schedule a regular appointment somewhere. I’ve tried therapy, tried multiple meds, hated them all. Therapy was just weird because I can so easily fool anyone into thinking I’m perfectly functional and I hate opening up to people because it’s burned me so bad in the past. 

I feel like I just want to give all my stuff away and walk away from my life and go live alone somewhere where no one knows me, because it’s almost more painful to be so close to loved ones and still feel so alone. 

I’ve tried picking up new interests or even aligning mine with people who show zero interest in anything I’m into, just on the off-chance they may return the gesture somewhere down the line. For example, I am so bored by sports, but a friend watches football religiously, so I try to pretend I’m into it and spent a couple years worth of weekends really making an effort to go over and watch it, only to have him basically turn down any ideas I’ve ever had. Now my job doesn’t allow for that(irregular schedule) and now I don’t talk to him regularly anymore. 

I mean, I could go on and on, but basically, I feel like no one is there for me, and if I want some semblance of a social life, I have to just tag along with whatever they were going to do anyways. 

No one makes time for me and when I confide in someone about it, they basically tell me that it’s all in my head and I just need to get over it and say yes more. But I tried that, and it results in lots of time invested in things I don’t like very much, and no return gestures. Even when our hobbies/interests align, they will tell me no because theyre all doing their own things.

I (f26) am now at home about a year, I'm not working or stuff like that.  
Most of the time I sit at home, play games, watching Netflix or videos, or writing with my friends and my boyfriend - to be honest, they're the reason I'm still here.  
Short summary, I nursed my mother my whole life and moved out in November 2017, there is only a bit contact that is more toxic than helpful, and she never accepts that I'm suffering from Depression, eating disorder, combined peronality disorder, and other stuff. For her.. SHE is the one with issues, not me.  


Some days it's so hard for me to even get up and buy something to eat, and the other stuff... I'm ignoring letters, I really have to go to the jobcenter, I want to move to another city, I have to do more at the household, but.. I do nothing.  
I am afraid. I am afraid to go to the jobcenter, that they're angry at me that I ignored the letters nearly a year, I am afraid to search an apartement, I see what I have to do, but I ignore it.   
I did therapies and do ergotherapy, I always take my antidepressants, and.. I want to change things. I try to plan my day, but then I think ""yeah, I can do it tomorrow"" - and that changes to next week, month, and so on.  
When I have motivation to do things, I do a fraction of that, then I'm exhausted and stop with that.  
I want to move on, I want to work again, I want to be there for my cats and friends, I want to have a normal life, but... everything fails, and when someone says he'll help me, I always say, I can do it on my own ;\_;  


How I can motivate myself? How can I be confident enough, how can I stop being afraid to change my situation? I really have no idea ;\_;

 And knowing from my parents and sibling (all with worse hearing than me) that hearing aids don't even bring you up to par with average hearing, and it's a difficult adjustment because hearing aids aren't sophisticated enough to filter sound like the human ear…I just don't want to do it. I don't want to get tested and find out just how hard of hearing I am. I don't want to wear hearing aids forever. I'd rather die, honestly.

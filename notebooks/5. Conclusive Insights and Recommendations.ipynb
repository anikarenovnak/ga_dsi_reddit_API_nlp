Posts coming from r/depression are expected to have a certain set of features that are different from features that represent the posts coming from r/anxiety in the feature space (disregarding features that are in the intersection of the two datasets). Qualitatively inspecting these features may therefore lead to some interesting insights. But before that, let's define depression disorder and anxiety disorder as they are currently known: "

I manually hand-picked a few and threw them into a word cloud based on the coefficient of the features (the coefficients were transformed into relative frequencies). Since this was a manual process, the sizes of the words don't represent the exact frequencies, but are a good relative approximation of those. Given more time, I will officially create a word cloud in python that utalizes the actual counts of these words across the entire document corpus. Here are some preliminary and rough results: "

We see other words like people, public, work, life, fail come up here.

    "Given the results of this project, my recommendations are as follows: \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Researchers intersted in understanding how machine learning can help in the medical and mental health industries shouldn't worry too much about 'clean' data and should use social media and online discussion platforms such as reddit to conduct research. This data is free and easily accessible and it shows promising potential. \n",
    "\n",
    "2. Investors should invest funds in the research and development of machine learning technologies because these technologies may change the way conventional diagnostication is done, making the process a lot more efficient, fast and easy. \n",
    "\n",
    "3. Investors should incest funds in the research and development of machine learning technologies because they have the potential of discovering symptomology of new, unprecedented ailments leveraging a computer's ability to traverse massive amounts of data. So far all known illnesses and disorders known to the medical and mental health professionals and researchers are based on data collected by individual patients going to a professional's office to seek treatment. We have an extensive medical literature of definitions and symptoms of known medical conditions. But this doesn't mean that what we know today is all that there is. We don't know what we don't know and beyond that new or different varieties of existing ailnments evolve and morphe every day. The use of big data and machine learning may help researchers identify or discover such unprecedented cases much faster than is currently possible. "
